Here's what I've gathered:
*   **Program Type:** Joint professional program between Statistics and Computer Sciences Departments. Coursework-based, not research-based (no thesis required).
*   **Curriculum:** 30 credits covering statistical theories, methodologies, computer systems, algorithms, machine learning, and electives.
*   **Interdisciplinary:** Joint program between Statistics and Computer Sciences, allows combining with domain knowledge to address data-rich problems.
*   **Career Focus:** Graduates seek employment as data analysts and data scientists.
*   **Internship/Practicum:** Students interested in COMP SCI 702 Graduate Cooperative Education course (likely internship/practicum related).
*   **Career Services:** Department of Statistics Student Career Resources page, Graduate School career services, Handshake.
*   **ROI/Outcomes:** STEM-OPT eligible.
*   **Accelerated Pathway:** For UW-Madison alumni in related fields, can complete in one calendar year (3 semesters).
*   **Faculty Strengths/Lab Resources:** Not explicitly detailed in terms of ""faculty strengths"" or ""lab resources"" but implies strong departments due to joint nature. ""High Throughput Computing Resources"" is mentioned under ""Computing"" section in the menu, but not directly linked to the MS Data Science program itself as a selling point.
*   **Funding:** Limited selective scholarships, but no tuition remission from graduate assistantships as it's a professional program. Students can apply for hourly positions and assistantships for stipends.

Now, I will formulate 3-5 concise bullet points.

*   Joint professional program in Data Science from Statistics and Computer Sciences departments.
*   Curriculum focuses on statistical theories, computational skills, algorithms, and machine learning.
*   Accelerated pathway available for UW-Madison alumni, completing the MS degree in one calendar year.
*   STEM-OPT eligible program, preparing graduates for data analyst and data scientist roles.
*   Opportunities for cooperative education via COMP SCI 702 and access to career resources.

These points are concise, highlight distinct features, and are within the word limit.

Here's what I've gathered:
*   **Ph.D. program:**
    *   **Main research areas/concentrations:** Biostatistics, Probability/Mathematical Statistics, Data Science, and Actuarial Science/Financial Mathematics.
    *   **Interdisciplinary links:** Students can take coursework/seminars in other departments to relate specialization to other fields.
    *   **Research component:** Requires a dissertation, with a prospectus and defense.
    *   **Funding:** All applicants are considered for financial support, including graduate assistantships (research assistants, teaching assistants, graders).
*   **MS program (relevant as it's often a stepping stone to PhD):**
    *   The MS in Statistics is offered without a thesis.
    *   Students typically admit to MS first, then proceed to PhD.

I need to condense this into 3-5 concise bullet points, focusing on *key academic and career-oriented selling points*.

Let's formulate the bullets:
*   Ph.D. concentrations in Biostatistics, Data Science, Probability/Mathematical Statistics, and Actuarial Science/Financial Mathematics.
*   Interdisciplinary coursework opportunities linking statistical specialization to other academic fields.
*   Comprehensive financial support available through graduate assistantships for all applicants.
*   Rigorous doctoral research culminating in a dissertation with a qualifying and comprehensive exam.

These four points seem to cover the main academic and career advantages without being too generic. They also fit the word count and formatting requirements.
• Ph.D. concentrations in Biostatistics, Data Science, Probability/Mathematical Statistics, and Actuarial Science/Financial Mathematics.
• Interdisciplinary coursework opportunities linking statistical specialization to other academic fields.
• Comprehensive financial support available through graduate assistantships for all applicants.
• Rigorous doctoral research culminating in a dissertation with a qualifying and comprehensive exam.

It also mentions a required capstone project and students potentially substituting the practicum with an internship/summer work experience.

Here are the key selling points extracted:

*   30-semester hour curriculum with core courses in probability, statistics, data management, and visualization.
*   Required capstone project for hands-on problem-solving, communication skills, and data ethics.
*   Electives from Statistics, Computer Science, Business Analytics, and Biostatistics for specialized skill development.

Here's a breakdown of the selling points found:

**Academic Master's (MS in Data Science):**
*   **Curriculum:** Covers fundamentals like probability and statistics, data storage/management, visualization, exploration, modeling, analysis, and uncertainty quantification.
*   **Hands-on Experience:** Includes a required capstone project for solving real-world problems, communication skills, and data ethics.
*   **Electives:** Students can choose electives from Statistics and Actuarial Science, Computer Science, Business Analytics, and Biostatistics departments.
*   **Practicum/Internship:** A ""MS Data Science Practicum"" (DATA:5890) is required, but students can substitute it with an appropriate internship/summer work experience with advisor approval.
*   **Datathon:** The program includes ""Data Science Bootcamps"" each fall, concluded by an annual ""Hawkeye Datathon"".
*   **Flexibility:** The program can be completed in three or four semesters.
*   **No GRE required:** For admission, GRE is not required.

Here are the key selling points I've identified:

*   **Professional Master's (M.A.S.):**
    *   **Program Type:** Master of Applied Science (M.A.S.)
    *   **STEM Designated:** Yes, which is advantageous for international students (F-1 Visa requirements met).
    *   **Elevate Program:** Guarantees hands-on experiences like research projects, internships, and competitions, along with personalized academic and career mentorship.
    *   **Curriculum:** Includes a six-credit-hour practicum project. Key coursework includes Database Organization, Data Mining, Machine Learning, Big Data Technologies, and Graph Theory and Applications.
    *   **Career Opportunities:** High demand (36% growth projected through 2031 for data scientists), with alumni working at companies like Accenture, Google, Amazon, and JPMorgan Chase in roles such as data scientist and machine learning engineer.
    *   **Location:** In close proximity to Chicago's thriving tech industry.
    *   **Faculty:** Learn from leading experts and accomplished researchers, with faculty encouraging students to join them in pushing boundaries in AI, cybersecurity, big data, and cloud computing.

Now, I will synthesize this into 3-5 concise bullet points, adhering to the word limit and formatting requirements.

1.  **Elevate program:** Guarantees hands-on experiences, including research projects, internships, and competitions, plus personalized career mentorship.
2.  **Professional practicum:** Six-credit-hour practicum project applying concepts in database organization, data mining, machine learning, and big data technologies.
3.  **STEM-designated degree:** Fulfills F-1 Visa requirements and provides an advantage for international students.
4.  **Chicago tech hub location:** Program location offers proximity to a thriving tech industry and diverse career opportunities.
5.  **Expert faculty guidance:** Mentors and researchers in AI, cybersecurity, big data, and cloud computing.

I will combine the STEM designation and F-1 visa requirement into one point. The career opportunities and specific companies/roles can be generalized into strong career outcomes facilitated by the practicum and Elevate program. The curriculum details can be combined with the practicum. I need to make sure each bullet is under 25 words.

Let's refine:
*   Guaranteed hands-on experiences through the Elevate program, including research, internships, and personalized career mentorship.
*   Six-credit-hour professional practicum project covering database, machine learning, big data, and graph theory applications.
*   STEM-designated program, meeting F-1 Visa requirements for international students.
*   Location in Chicago's thriving tech industry provides direct access to diverse career opportunities.
*   Expert faculty guidance and research opportunities in AI, cybersecurity, big data, and cloud computing.
