It also has a link ""Visit College Site"" and mentions ""Explore the full list of College of Science and Technology student clubs and organizations.""

This strongly indicates that the program is housed within the ""College of Science and Technology"". I need to find the homepage URL for this college. At the bottom of the page, there is a ""Visit College Site"" link. I will browse this link to get the URL. I will assume this link leads to the home page.
I will look for ""Visit College Site"" URL.
The URL from the program page is `https://www.temple.edu/academics/degree-programs/mathematics-ms-st-math-ms`.
I will click on `Visit College Site` if there is a direct link on the page, or infer the URL based on the name.
Looking at the content again, the ""Visit College Site"" is a button on the bottom of the page that is not directly accessible. However, it explicitly states ""College of Science and Technology"" multiple times. I can try to infer the URL or use search. Given the clear name, I will try to infer the most likely URL structure for a college within Temple University, which would probably be `https://cst.temple.edu` or `https://www.temple.edu/cst`. I'll try the more common one `https://cst.temple.edu`.
