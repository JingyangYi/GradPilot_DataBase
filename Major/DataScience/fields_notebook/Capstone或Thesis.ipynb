In either case the students will use the skills acquired during the other classes in executing project goals. Students will provide short reports to supervising faculty to ensure that learning objectives are being met.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This clearly indicates a project requirement. The options are an internship, a research project, or an elective in place of a project. However, the \"Data Science Project\" (CDA 571) is listed as a course requirement. The initial instruction asks for requirements \"that go beyond regular coursework\". Since the project is listed as a course (CDA 571), I need to clarify if it is considered a non-coursework requirement in the context of this question or if the \"elective in place of a project\" option truly means there isn't always a \"project\" beyond coursework.\n",
      "\n",
      "The phrasing \"Students have the opportunity to complete an internship in industry for their data science project requirements. Alternatively, students can opt to complete a research project with a faculty member, or complete an elective in place of a project.\" suggests that the project is a flexible requirement. Given that an internship or research project can fulfill it, it aligns with a \"non-coursework\" type of requirement even if it's tied to a specific course code. The \"elective in place of a project\" option makes it tricky.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me re-read the \"What to output\" section: \"Summarize the requirement(s) in one concise sentence—no quotes, no explanations. If multiple options exist, describe them briefly (e.g., “Capstone or thesis option”). If the program states there are *no* additional requirements, say so (e.g., “No additional graduation requirement”).\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The core of the requirement is a \"data science project\" which can be fulfilled by an \"internship\", a \"research project\", or an \"elective\". If an elective can replace it, it might imply no *additional* non-coursework requirement if the student chooses that path.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the \"data science project\" (CDA 571) is described as a \"final integrative project experience\" and requires students to \"obtain an integrative project experience either in industry or at the university\". This sounds like a capstone or research project, even if it's a 3-credit course. The \"elective in place of a project\" seems like an alternative to the project itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the prompt's examples like \"Capstone project required\" or \"Research thesis mandatory\", and the description of CDA 571 as an \"integrative project experience\" fulfilled by an industry internship or research project, it seems to fall under the \"capstone project\" or \"research project\" category. The \"elective in place of a project\" is an *option* for fulfilling that *requirement*.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, a project experience is a requirement, with multiple ways to satisfy it. It's not *just* taking an elective.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will phrase it as a project requirement with options.\n",
      "\"Data science project required, fulfillable through an internship, research project, or elective.\"\n",
      "This is too long. I need to be more concise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Data science project required; internship or research project option available.\"\n",
      "This still doesn't capture the \"elective\" part which could mean no *additional* non-coursework.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's consider the phrase \"final integrative project experience\" and that it can be an \"internship in industry\" or a \"research project\". This points to a project-based requirement. The \"elective in place of a project\" is an alternative *to* the project itself. If a student chooses the elective, then arguably there is no *additional* non-coursework requirement.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prompt asks \"all graduation requirements that go beyond regular coursework\". If an elective can fully substitute the project, then for those students, there is no *beyond coursework* requirement.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a grey area. Let me re-evaluate the \"CDA 571/ Project Guidance\" course. It is a 3-credit course. Is a 3-credit course considered \"beyond regular coursework\"? The prompt states \"Capstone project\", \"Research thesis\", \"Internship / practicum hours\" as examples of non-coursework requirements. A capstone project can often be associated with a course, but it's the *nature* of the work (project, thesis, internship) that defines it as \"beyond regular coursework\" in this context.\n",
      "\n",
      "The description of CDA 571 says \"Students will obtain an integrative project experience either in industry or at the university.\" This strongly suggests a capstone-like experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "The phrasing \"or complete an elective in place of a project\" is the sticking point. If this means a student can *choose* to not do a project/internship and instead take a regular course, then it implies there isn't always a \"beyond regular coursework\" requirement.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the main statement is \"a data science project (3 credits)\". The subsequent sentence offers alternatives to *that* project. The most common interpretation of \"capstone project\" or \"research thesis\" is that they are required, even if they sometimes carry course credit.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should focus on what is *required* and what options fulfill that requirement. A \"data science project\" is required, and it can be fulfilled in different ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Data science project required, with internship or research project options.\" This still doesn't capture the \"elective\" option which could negate a *non-coursework* requirement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's consider the strictest interpretation of \"beyond regular coursework.\" If an elective (a regular course) can replace it, then for that option, there is no \"beyond regular coursework\" requirement.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the requirement *can be fulfilled* by *only* coursework (an elective), then it's not a universal *non-coursework* requirement.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will lean towards \"Not found\" if the elective option truly means no additional non-coursework requirement *for all students*. But the prompt states \"all graduation requirements that go beyond regular coursework\". So if it exists as *an option* for fulfillment, it should be mentioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "The \"data science project\" is a requirement, which can be an internship, research project, or another elective.\n",
      "So, a project experience is a requirement, and two of its fulfillment methods (internship, research project) are indeed \"beyond regular coursework\" type activities, even if tied to a 3-credit course.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I state \"Capstone project required\", it might be inaccurate because an elective can substitute.\n",
      "If I state \"No additional graduation requirement\", it might be inaccurate because an internship or research project are options.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's re-read the \"What to output\" guidelines for multiple options: \"If multiple options exist, describe them briefly (e.g., “Capstone or thesis option”).\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The program states: \"Students will take...a data science project (3 credits)\".\n",
      "\"Students have the opportunity to complete an internship in industry for their data science project requirements. Alternatively, students can opt to complete a research project with a faculty member, or complete an elective in place of a project.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This means there *is* a \"data science project\" requirement, and that project can be an internship or research project. The elective is an *alternative* to that project.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the requirement is a \"Data Science Project\". This project can be an internship, research project, or an elective.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prompt wants requirements *that go beyond regular coursework*. An internship or research project fit this. An elective does not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since a student can choose an elective *instead* of a project or internship, it means that a non-coursework requirement is *not* universally mandated. If a student chooses the elective path, there would be no \"beyond regular coursework\" requirement for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "This leads me to believe that there isn't a *mandatory* non-coursework requirement for all students.\n",
      "The prompt asks to identify *all* graduation requirements that go *beyond* regular coursework. If it's optional to do something *beyond* regular coursework, then it's not a universal requirement *that goes beyond regular coursework*.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prompt's examples like \"Capstone project required\" or \"Research thesis mandatory\" imply a universal requirement. If there's an option to simply take another course, it's not universally \"beyond coursework\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the ambiguity created by the \"elective in place of a project\" option, I will stick to the strict interpretation: if it's not *mandated* for every student to complete something beyond coursework (because an elective can substitute), then it's not a universal \"beyond regular coursework\" requirement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, \"No additional graduation requirement\" seems appropriate if the elective option means a student can avoid the \"beyond coursework\" activities.\n",
