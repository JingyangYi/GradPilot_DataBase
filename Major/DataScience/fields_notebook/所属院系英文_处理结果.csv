The first URL states under ""Contact Information"": ""Department of Statistics, College of Letters & Science"". The second URL's title is ""Statistics and Data Science Option – Department of Statistics – UW ..."" and it also explicitly mentions ""School of Computer, Data & Information Sciences"" in the header.

So, the Department of Statistics is housed within the College of Letters & Science, and also associated with the School of Computer, Data & Information Sciences.

Looking at the URLs, https://stat.wisc.edu/ appears to be the homepage for the Department of Statistics. The question asks for the ""school / college / faculty"" that houses the program and its *official homepage URL*.

From the second browsed page: ""Department of Statistics, School of Computer, Data & Information Sciences"". This suggests that the Department of Statistics is part of the School of Computer, Data & Information Sciences (CDIS).

Let's verify which one is the ""school/college"".
The first URL states ""Department of Statistics, College of Letters & Science"".
The second URL states ""Department of Statistics"" and then ""School of Computer, Data & Information Sciences"".

It seems the Department of Statistics is the primary department, and it is part of the College of Letters & Science, and also associated with the School of Computer, Data & Information Sciences. The ""School of Computer, Data & Information Sciences"" seems more like a ""school/college"" entity than a ""department"".

Both pages also clearly state that the Goergen Institute is under the ""Hajim School of Engineering & Applied Sciences"".

Looking at the footer of the browsed pages, under ""Schools & divisions"", ""Hajim School of Engineering"" is listed.
The URL for the Goergen Institute is `https://www.sas.rochester.edu/dsc/` which is a sub-domain of `sas.rochester.edu`. This indicates that `sas.rochester.edu` is likely the School of Arts & Sciences.

Let's check the URL for the Hajim School of Engineering & Applied Sciences from the browsed pages. The program is within the Goergen Institute for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence which is under the Hajim School of Engineering & Applied Sciences.

Let's look for the official homepage for the ""Hajim School of Engineering & Applied Sciences"". The browsed pages show a link for ""Hajim School of Engineering & Applied Sciences"" at the top of the page. The `sas.rochester.edu` domain seems to be for ""School of Arts & Sciences"".

I will check the ""Schools & divisions"" section again in the footer. It lists ""Hajim School of Engineering"". I need to find the homepage URL for that school.
Since the current URL `https://www.sas.rochester.edu` is for the ""School of Arts & Sciences"" and not the ""Hajim School of Engineering & Applied Sciences"", I should search for the Hajim School's homepage.

Let's search for ""University of Rochester Hajim School of Engineering & Applied Sciences site:.edu"" to find its homepage.",FALSE

Watson College of Engineering and Applied Science.
The prompt asks for *one* clear school/college name and its most authoritative homepage URL. Since the program is a collaboration, it doesn't clearly ""house"" in one specific school. However, the ""Thomas J. Watson College of Engineering and Applied Science"" sounds like a strong candidate, given the nature of a Data Analytics MS, and ""engineering"" often implies a more technical, applied science focus. I will check the homepage of each of the three schools mentioned to see if one of them is the primary home or if there's a dedicated graduate school for such programs.

I will start by searching for the ""Thomas J. Watson College of Engineering and Applied Science Binghamton University"" homepage. Then, if needed, I will check the other two.

Let's try to search specifically for ""Thomas J. Watson College of Engineering and Applied Science Binghamton University site:.edu"" and other two colleges.",FALSE,"The program description states: ""The STEM program leverages the cross-disciplinary insights of three of Binghamton University's schools: Harpur College of Arts and Sciences, School of Management, Thomas J. Watson College of Engineering and Applied Science.""

This indicates that the program is not housed within a single school but is a collaboration. However, the user explicitly asks for ""one clear school/college name"" and ""the most authoritative homepage URL for *that school*"". Since it's a collaborative program, finding a single school that ""houses"" it might be tricky.

Given the options, the program is housed within three schools. I need to choose the most appropriate one or state ""Not found"" if no single school is identified as the primary housing entity.

Let's check if the program has a primary affiliation with one of these schools or if there's a dedicated graduate school that oversees it. The admissions page mentions ""The Graduate School website"" for more information about graduate study at Binghamton University. This is a good lead.

I will browse the Graduate School website to see if it acts as the primary administrative body for this program or if it offers a more general overview.

Scanning the content of the second URL, I see:
*   ""WPI's PhD in data science is interdisciplinary, drawing from Computer Science, Mathematical Sciences, and the Business School.""
*   Under ""Faculty Profiles"", it lists faculty from ""Computer Science"", ""Mathematical Sciences"", and ""The Business School"".
*   Under ""Affiliations"", it lists ""Computer Science"", ""Mathematical Sciences"", ""The Business School"", and ""Data Science Program"".

It seems the Data Science PhD is an interdisciplinary program, not housed in a single traditional ""school"" or ""college"" but drawing from multiple departments. The ""Data Science Program"" itself is listed as an affiliation.

Given the instructions, ""Capture *one* clear school/college name"" and ""If no reliable *.edu* source identifies the school, output **Not found**"", and the interdisciplinary nature, it's not directly housed under a single ""School of X"" or ""College of Y"". However, ""Data Science Program"" is listed. I need to determine if ""Data Science Program"" can be considered a ""school / college / faculty"" in the context of the requested output. Usually, a program is housed *within* a school or college.

Since it explicitly states ""Data Science Program"" as an affiliation and mentions ""Elke Rundensteiner, Professor, Computer Science, Program Head, Data Science"", it implies a distinct program, but not necessarily a ""school"" or ""college"" in the traditional sense. The output format requires a ""School / College Name"".
