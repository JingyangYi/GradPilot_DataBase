From the content, it clearly states: ""The University of Washington Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering's graduate programs..."".

Therefore, the school is the ""Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering"" and its homepage is `https://www.ece.uw.edu`. I will confirm this by checking if it is a department *within* a larger school or college. The URL structure `ece.uw.edu` suggests it's a primary departmental site. Looking at the breadcrumbs on the page, it says ""Home UW Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering Academics Master's & Ph.D."". This strongly indicates ""Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering"" is the entity being sought.

It does not mention being part of a larger College/School on the homepage. I will use the current URL as the homepage.

Now I need to find the homepage URL for the Rosenstiel School. The current URLs are for the Master of Science in Data Science program, which is housed within that school. I'll search for ""Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science"" on the University of Miami site, or directly search for its homepage.

Since the program explicitly mentions ""Rosenstiel School of Marine & Atmospheric Sciences"", I will prioritize finding the homepage for that school. The full name appears to be ""Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science"" based on the browse results.

Let's try a concise search for ""Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science site:.edu"" to find its homepage.",False
