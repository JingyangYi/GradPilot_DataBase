From the content of `https://sp2.upenn.edu/program/master-of-science-in-social-policy-data-analytics-for-social-policy-certificate/`:

*   Under ""Director's Welcome"", it states: ""Policy internships and projects will give you the opportunity to apply your skills in real-world settings."" and ""In addition to our rigorous academic training, you will gain real-world experience through a policy internship that will connect you with policy practitioners and organizations in multiple sectors and settings.""
*   Under ""The SP2 Difference"", it mentions: ""Gain hands-on, career-focused experience through policy internships in data analytics"" and ""Engage in practical policy research in the Data for Equitable Justice Lab"".
*   Under ""Curriculum"", in the ""3rd Semester (Fall)"" section, it lists: ""MSSP 6380: MSSP+DA Capstone Seminar: Telling Stories with Data (1CU)"" and ""MSSP 6390: MSSP+DA Policy Internship in Data Analytics Seminar (0CU)"".
*   Under ""Social Policy Internship"", it explicitly states: ""The MSSP+DA program provides students with competitive and cutting-edge opportunities to complete policy internships in data analytics... Credit for internships is incorporated into the MSSP+DA Capstone Seminar, and students most often complete the internship in their final spring semester. The Data Analytics policy internship must consist of a minimum commitment of 150 hours.""

So, there are two clear non-coursework requirements: a Capstone Seminar and a Policy Internship. The internship is explicitly stated to be a minimum of 150 hours.

Let's synthesize this into one concise sentence.

Capstone seminar and a policy internship of at least 150 hours required.

The second URL, https://stat.uw.edu/academics/graduate/programs/phd, contains detailed graduation requirements under the ""Ph.D. Program"" section.

I need to extract the ""non-coursework"" requirements for the ""Statistics in the Social Sciences (CSSS) Track"".

Looking at the ""General Statistics Track"" for common requirements that might apply to all tracks:
- M.S. Theory Exam
- Research Prelim Exam
- Consulting (STAT 599)
- Applied Data Analysis Project (STAT 597)
- Statistics seminar participation (STAT 590)
- Teaching requirement (Teaching Assistant)
- General Exam
- Dissertation Credits (STAT 800)
- Passage of the Dissertation Defense

Now, I will specifically look at the ""Statistics in the Social Sciences (CSSS) Track"" section to see if there are any specific additional requirements or modifications.

The ""Statistics in the Social Sciences (CSSS) Track"" section states:
- ""Students in the Statistics in the Social Sciences (CSSS) Ph.D. track are required to take four numerically graded 500-level courses, including at least two CSSS courses or STAT courses cross-listed with CSSS, and at most two discipline-specific social science courses that together form a coherent program of study. These courses may be counted as the four required Ph.D.-level electives."" - This refers to coursework.
- ""Additionally, students must complete at least three quarters of participation (one credit per quarter) in the CS&SS seminar (CSSS 590)."" - This is similar to the general seminar participation.

It seems the general requirements for the PhD program, which include non-coursework elements, apply to all tracks unless explicitly stated otherwise. The CSSS track just specifies its coursework electives and seminar participation.

Therefore, the non-coursework requirements are likely those listed under the ""General Statistics Track"" that are not explicitly course numbers for credit, but rather activities or exams.

Let's re-evaluate the ""General Statistics Track"" for non-coursework items:
- M.S. Theory Exam
- Research Prelim Exam
- Consulting (Requires enrollment in STAT 599, but the requirement is the consulting itself)
- Applied Data Analysis Project (Requires enrollment in 3 credits of STAT 597, but the requirement is the project itself)
- Statistics seminar participation (Students must attend the Statistics Department seminar and enroll in STAT 590 for at least 8 quarters - the participation is the requirement)
- Teaching requirement (All Ph.D. students must satisfactorily serve as a Teaching Assistant for at least one quarter)
- General Exam
- Dissertation Credits (STAT 800) - This is coursework related to the dissertation.
- Passage of the Dissertation Defense

The key non-coursework requirements seem to be:
- M.S. Theory Exam
- Research Prelim Exam
- Consulting
- Applied Data Analysis Project
- Statistics seminar participation
- Teaching requirement
- General Exam
- Dissertation Defense

The prompt asks for ""one concise sentence"" and examples like ""Capstone or thesis option available"" or ""Comprehensive exam required"".

Given the detailed list, a ""research thesis"" is implied by ""Dissertation Credits"" and ""Passage of the Dissertation Defense"". ""Comprehensive exam"" is covered by ""M.S. Theory Exam"", ""Research Prelim Exam"", and ""General Exam"". ""Consulting"" and ""Applied Data Analysis Project"" are practical experiences. ""Seminar participation"" and ""Teaching requirement"" are also non-coursework activities.

I need to synthesize this into one concise sentence, focusing on the main overarching non-coursework requirements. The most prominent ones are the exams and the dissertation/thesis.

Let's try to combine them concisely.
""M.S. Theory Exam, Research Prelim Exam, General Exam, Dissertation Defense, consulting, applied data analysis project, seminar participation, and a teaching requirement are mandatory.""

This is a bit long for ""one concise sentence"". I should try to group them.
The exams are comprehensive/qualifying exams.
The dissertation is a research thesis.
Consulting and applied data analysis project are akin to practical work or projects.
Seminar participation and teaching requirement are also additional activities.

Let's simplify.
""Comprehensive examinations, a research dissertation with defense, consulting, an applied data analysis project, seminar participation, and a teaching requirement are mandatory.""

This still feels a bit long. The prompt examples are very short.
""Comprehensive exam required"" or ""Research thesis mandatory"".

Maybe I should focus on the most significant ones for a PhD, which are typically comprehensive/qualifying exams and a dissertation/thesis. The other items are also important but might be considered components of the overall program rather than ""beyond regular coursework"" in the same vein as a capstone or thesis. However, the prompt explicitly lists ""Internship / practicum hours"" and ""Mandatory fieldwork or research‐lab hours"" which consulting and applied data analysis could fall under.

Let's re-read the prompt: ""all graduation requirements that go beyond regular coursework"".
So, all items listed are relevant.

I need to find the most concise way to combine these.
""Comprehensive and preliminary exams, a research dissertation with defense, consulting, an applied data analysis project, seminar participation, and a teaching requirement are mandatory.""

Let's consider the example format: ""Capstone project required"", ""Research thesis mandatory"".
If I list everything, it becomes a list. The prompt says ""one concise sentence"".

The general exam and dissertation are typically the final hurdles for a PhD. The other items are also requirements.

Let me try to phrase it like: ""Multiple comprehensive and preliminary exams, a research dissertation with defense, consulting, an applied data analysis project, seminar participation, and a teaching requirement are mandatory.""

Let's try to categorize.
Exams: M.S. Theory Exam, Research Prelim Exam, General Exam. These are comprehensive/qualifying exams.
Research: Dissertation and Dissertation Defense. This is a research thesis.
Practical: Consulting, Applied Data Analysis Project.
Other: Statistics seminar participation, Teaching requirement.

""Comprehensive and preliminary exams, a research dissertation with defense, an applied data analysis project, consulting, seminar participation, and a teaching assistantship are required.""

This is still a long sentence.
Could I simplify to say ""Exams, a dissertation, practical projects, and a teaching requirement""?
This might be too vague.

Let's stick to the specific names if possible but combine them for conciseness.
""M.S. Theory, Research Prelim, and General Exams; a research dissertation with defense; consulting; an applied data analysis project; seminar participation; and a teaching requirement are mandatory.""

This is a list, but it's in one sentence. It adheres to ""all graduation requirements that go beyond regular coursework"".

Let me re-check the example format: ""Capstone project required"", ""Research thesis mandatory"".
This implies a very short, specific answer. If there are many, how do I handle it?
""If multiple options exist, describe them briefly (e.g., “Capstone or thesis option”)."" This implies choices, not a long list of distinct requirements.

Given the strict ""one concise sentence"" and ""no explanations"", simply listing them might be the best approach if they cannot be grouped under a single umbrella term.

However, ""Comprehensive/qualifying exam"" and ""Research thesis"" are already umbrella terms provided by the prompt.

So, I can definitely say ""Comprehensive exams and a research thesis with defense are required.""
But then I miss consulting, applied data analysis, seminar, and teaching.

Let's re-read the ""What to output"" section carefully:
""• Summarize the requirement(s) in one concise sentence—no quotes, no explanations.
• If multiple options exist, describe them briefly (e.g., “Capstone or thesis option”).
• If the program states there are no additional requirements, say so (e.g., “No additional graduation requirement”).
• If you do not find a clear statement from an .edu source, output Not found—never guess or invent.""

The requirements are distinct, not options. So the ""multiple options"" guidance doesn't directly apply for formatting a list of distinct items.

Given the desired conciseness, perhaps the most significant non-coursework components of a PhD are the exams and the dissertation.

Let's try to focus on the key requirements that define a PhD beyond just taking classes.
These are typically passing comprehensive/qualifying exams and completing a dissertation.

""Comprehensive and preliminary exams, a research dissertation with defense, and a teaching requirement are mandatory.""
This leaves out consulting, applied data analysis project, and seminar participation. Are these less significant ""beyond coursework"" requirements? The prompt asks for *all* requirements.

Let's check the wording of the requirements from the source again:
- M.S. Theory Exam
- Research Prelim Exam
- Consulting. Requires enrollment in STAT 599.
- Applied Data Analysis Project. Requires enrollment in 3 credits of STAT 597.
- Statistics seminar participation: Students must attend the Statistics Department seminar and enroll in STAT 590 for at least 8 quarters.
- Teaching requirement: All Ph.D. students must satisfactorily serve as",The,"The Ph.D. program requires a dissertation defense, a general exam, a research prelim exam, an M.S. theory exam, consulting, an applied data analysis project, statistics seminar participation, and a teaching assistantship.",,

Under the ""Master of Science (MS) Degree"" section, it states: ""The Master of Science (MS) degree, often precursory to the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree, typically requires the student to complete a research-based thesis.""
It also mentions ""Data Science Option"", but it states that ""The primary learning outcome for the SAFS DSO is for students to have professional working proficiency – gained through coursework – in data management, data visualization, software engineering (data focused), and statistical modeling."" This suggests that the data science option's learning outcome is achieved through coursework and does not explicitly mention additional non-coursework requirements beyond the general MS thesis requirement.
