    "   • If multiple options exist, describe them briefly (e.g., “Capstone or thesis option”).  \n",
    "   • If the program states there are *no* additional requirements, say so (e.g., “No additional graduation requirement”).  \n",

These courses may be counted as the four required Ph.D.-level electives.\" - This refers to coursework.\n",

      "\n",
      "However, \"Comprehensive/qualifying exam\" and \"Research thesis\" are already umbrella terms provided by the prompt.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I can definitely say \"Comprehensive exams and a research thesis with defense are required.\"\n",
      "But then I miss consulting, applied data analysis, seminar, and teaching.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's re-read the \"What to output\" section carefully:\n",
      "\"• Summarize the requirement(s) in one concise sentence—no quotes, no explanations.\n",
      "• If multiple options exist, describe them briefly (e.g., “Capstone or thesis option”).\n",
      "• If the program states there are no additional requirements, say so (e.g., “No additional graduation requirement”).\n",
      "• If you do not find a clear statement from an .edu source, output Not found—never guess or invent.\"\n",

    "TASK:\n",
    "Based on these 3 responses, determine what the actual graduation requirement is using majority voting principles. If 2 or more responses say the same thing, that should be your answer. If all responses are different, choose the most specific and detailed one.\n",

    "INSTRUCTIONS:\n",
    "1. Read all 3 responses carefully\n",
    "2. Identify what graduation requirement (beyond coursework) each response mentions\n",
    "3. Apply majority voting - if 2+ responses agree, use that answer\n",
    "4. If responses conflict, choose the most detailed/specific one\n",
    "5. Give your final answer as a clear, concise statement\n",
    "6. If the resposnes are Not found, that means there is no additional graduation requirement.\n",
