Data Science lies at the intersection of statistical methodology, computational science, and a wide range of application domains. The program offers strong preparation in statistical modeling, machine learning, optimization, management and analysis of massive data sets, and data acquisition. The program focuses on topics such as reproducible data analysis, collaborative problem solving, visualization and communication, and security and ethical issues that arise in data science. To earn the Master of Science in Data Science, students must complete 12 courses. This requires students to be on campus for at least 3 semesters (one and a half academic years). Some students will choose to extend their studies for a fourth semester to take additional courses or complete a master’s thesis research project. You can learn more about the Data Science program by watching the videos at the links below: Virtual Information Session for Fall 2025 Matriculation Current Master's Student Program Discussion, October 2024 Why pursue a master’s degree in Data Science? With companies and organizations better able to capture data in a multitude of ways, data-driven decision making is changing the way businesses operate. Powerful analytics tools can model and predict how consumers will behave or markets will respond. Consequently, an understanding of data science is a 21st century job skill that can be beneficial in many different careers. Data Science Degree Career Paths Data Science career paths are flexible. There are different pathways to use data science skills. Data science professional - data analyst, database developer, or data scientist. Analytics-enabled jobs - functional business analyst or data-driven manager. Data science professionals like data analysts can become qualified for a data science or data system developer role depending on where they deepen their expertise. By expanding knowledge in Artificial Intelligence, statistics, data management, and big data analytics, a data analyst can transition into a data scientist role. By building on existing technical skills in Python, relational databases, and machine learning, a data analyst can become a data system developer. Requirements There are no formal prerequisites for applicants to this master’s program. However, successful applicants do need to have sufficient background knowledge of calculus, linear algebra and differential equations; familiarity with probability and statistical inference; fluency in at least one programming language such as python or R, and an understanding of basic computer science concepts. As Data Science is an interdisciplinary field, SEAS welcomes applicants with undergraduate training in a wide range of academic disciplines.

It does not supersede any information provided by the Harvard Kenneth C. Griffin Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. Jump to... Application Instructions (key fields) Admissions Timeline Contact Information Admissions FAQs How to Apply The submission portal is now closed for applications to the Data Science and Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) programs for entry in Fall 2025. Out of fairness to all applicants, SEAS does not accept late applications for any programs. Information about the Fall 2026 application will be available in Summer 2025 from the Harvard Kenneth C. Griffin Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (Harvard Griffin GSAS) website. Candidates will apply via the application portal on that website, and the deadline for that application will be 5pm Eastern Time, December 1, 2025. SEAS offers admissions for Fall Term matriculation only. In addition to the information below, please read the Harvard Griffin GSAS Application Instruction and Information page for important details pertaining to your graduate application. Admissions Criteria SEAS takes a holistic approach to admission, taking all relevant application materials into account. There is no GPA cutoff. The Data Science and CSE programs are looking for candidates who have demonstrated a capacity for advanced computational work by one or more of the following: excelling in courses in math, computer science, statistics or scientific computing; exploring computational or statistical approaches in undergraduate research; through distinctive professional or personal accomplishment. There are no formal prerequisites for applicants to these master’s programs. However, successful applicants do need to have sufficient background knowledge of calculus, linear algebra and differential equations; familiarity with probability and statistical inference; fluency in at least one programming language such as python or R, and an understanding of basic computer science concepts. As both Data Science and Computational Science and Engineering are interdisciplinary fields, SEAS welcomes applicants with undergraduate training in a wide range of academic disciplines. If your training in computer science, math and/or statistics is not reflected in the courses listed on your transcripts, you will need to find other parts of the application to make your training clear to the Admissions Committee. The Additional Materials section of the application is available to upload relevant information. You can also describe your training at one of your jobs or through self-study in your Statement of Purpose. SEAS does not accept General GRE scores nor Subject Test GRE scores for applicants to our programs. Applicants to these programs should not submit official or unofficial GRE scores to us nor mention them anywhere in their application materials. International Students: Applicants from institutions outside of the US must hold the equivalent of a US bachelor’s degree (BA or BS) from an institution of recognized standing (either a three or four year undergraduate degree). Applicants must submit original certified documents indicating the nature and scope of the education program(s) they have pursued. Only students who have an AB or SB degree, first class honors, or other evidence of academic excellence and who can understand rapid, idiomatic English, and can speak, write, and read English with a high degree of fluency should apply for admission. Click here for more information regarding English proficiency requirements. Students who are unsure of the US equivalency of their degree(s) should consult a reputable credential evaluation service. Important: Candidates for master’s degrees are not eligible for financial aid from SEAS. Students typically finance their master’s degree program with a combination of loans, savings, family support, grants (from governments, foundations and companies), fellowships and scholarships. We recommend you visit the Harvard Griffin GSAS Funding and Financial Aid website prior to your application to learn more about your options. Application Instructions (key fields) Degree Program Selection Select Engineering and Applied Sciences, then your desired degree and area of study. Institutions Attended Transcripts must be uploaded electronically. These copies can be official or unofficial. You should not mail hard copies to SEAS or Harvard Griffin GSAS. The application system will allow you to submit an update with your Fall semester grades when they are available. We do not have a minimum GPA requirement. If you have additional training or certifications to report, the Additional Materials section of the application is available to upload relevant information. Faculty Contacting faculty is not recommended for master's program applicants. While this section is relevant for applicants to the SEAS PhD programs, it is not necessary for Master's applicants to complete this section of the application. English Proficiency The Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) is required from all applicants whose native language is not English and who do not hold a Bachelor’s degree (or its equivalent) from an institution at which English is the language of instruction. Questions about this requirement, including waiver queries, should be directed to the contact information found on the Harvard Griffin GSAS page on English Proficiency. Use ETS code 3451 to send TOEFL scores to Harvard Griffin GSAS. If a department code is required, use code 99. A minimum score of 80 is required on the TOEFL and the score must be valid at the time of entry into the program. TOEFL scores expire after two years. Applicants to SEAS may opt to take the The International English Language Testing System (IELTS) instead of the TOEFL. Results should be sent to Harvard University, Harvard Kenneth C. Griffin Graduate School of Arts and Sciences by the IELTS test center via IELTS E-Delivery service. A minimum score of 6.5 is required on the IELTS and the score must be valid at the time of entry into the program. IELTS scores expire after two years. No test other than the iBT TOEFL or IELTS will be accepted as proof of English proficiency. The TOEFL iBT Home Edition is not accepted, nor is a Duolingo test. A master's degree is not accepted as proof of English proficiency. Test Scores SEAS does not accept General GRE scores nor Subject Test GRE scores for applicants to our programs. Applicants to these programs should not submit official or unofficial GRE scores to us nor mention them anywhere in their application materials. Resume/CV This should include education, work experience if any, honors, awards, papers submitted for publication, and other achievements. Recommendations Three (3) letters of recommendation are required from faculty, advisors, and/or employment supervisors. The letters should be from those who can speak to your abilities as a potential graduate student. No more than four (4) letters should support an application. You will be required to register your letter writers as part of the online application. They will be sent instructions via email about how to submit a letter on your behalf. Interfolio is not accepted. If a recommendation letter arrives after the Dec 1 deadline it will be added to your application file. However, application review will begin shortly after the deadline, so the later the letter arrives, the more chance there is that your file will be reviewed without the letter. Statement of Purpose This is your chance to tell the Admissions Committee about your experiences (including additional training not indicated on your transcript), interests, future goals, etc. Please keep the statement to about 1,000 words. Application Fee Waivers are available; eligibility is determined by completing a series of questions in the Application Fee section of the application. Once these questions have been completed, the application system will provide an immediate response regarding fee waiver eligibility. Miscellaneous Materials: Please do not send any materials other than what is required to complete the application. This includes copies of awards, papers for publication, multimedia, etc.; the requested resume or CV is the appropriate place to indicate these achievements. Miscellaneous materials other than those mentioned in the instructions above will not be reviewed by the committee. It is best not to send them. Interviews: We do not require an interview as part of the application process and we cannot offer applicants the opportunity for an in-person interview with the admissions staff. Admissions Timeline All applications will be under review beginning in December. Applicants will be notified of an official admissions decision by Harvard Griffin GSAS at the end of the review period (mid-February). Admissions decisions will be posted to the applicant’s online account in Slate. For privacy and security purposes, neither Harvard Griffin GSAS nor SEAS give out admissions decisions over the phone or via email. Refer to the Harvard Griffin GSAS After Application Submission page for additional information. The application cannot be edited or changed once it has been submitted . Should a letter of recommendation arrive after the application deadline it will be added to your application file. However, application review will begin shortly after the deadline, so the later the letter arrives, the more chance there is that your file will be reviewed without the letter. We cannot guarantee that materials received after the application deadline will be included in the application review.
