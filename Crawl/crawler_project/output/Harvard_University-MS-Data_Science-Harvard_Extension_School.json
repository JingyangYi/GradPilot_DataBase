Paying for School FAQs Who Pursues the Master’s Degree in Data Science? View More Students in the data science degree program are accomplished professionals with an average 11 years of professional experience. Many students are new to data science and are building a foundation to pursue career advancement (41 percent) or to deepen their expertise (31 percent). What Can You Do With a Master’s Degree in Data Science? View More A master’s degree in data science will give you both the theoretical knowledge and the practical skills you need to advance your career in this rapidly growing field. Advancing your education in data science can help you develop important analytical, business, modeling, and visualization skills, as well as advanced programming and coding skills. You may learn cutting-edge trends in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other developing technologies. Or you can explore new ways to apply your skills across different industries such as healthcare, advertising, wearable tech, or autonomous vehicles and drones. Is a Degree in Data Science Worth It? View More A degree in data science may not be required to get started in the field, especially for entry-level programmers and data analysts. Degrees in software engineering, computer science, math, and statistics can give you the basic skills you need to start a career in data science. However, a graduate degree in data science offers a combination of skills that can help you stay competitive in the job market. In addition to programming and statistics, for example, a degree in data science offers advanced knowledge of modeling, data visualization, data analysis, and business intelligence. Moreover, many mid- and senior-level positions such as data scientist or data architect for example, as well as most management positions, may require a master’s degree in data science. How Long Does it Take to Complete the Data Science Graduate Program? View More Program length is typically between 2 and 5 years. It depends on your preferred pace and the number of courses you want to take each semester. For an accelerated journey, we offer year-round study, where you can take courses in fall, January, spring, and summer.
