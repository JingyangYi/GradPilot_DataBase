Read on for a step-by-step guide to submitting an application, and attend an online event to find out more.\nIf you have already applied or wish to find out more on tracking your application status, please visit our After you've applied webpage.\nBrowse our postgraduate taught courses for your area of interest.\nUnsure? Attend an event to learn more about our courses and campuses.\nPlease note, if you are looking to apply to one of the below courses, all information on entry requirements and how to apply can be found directly on the partner institutions webpage.\nIf you are looking to apply for a PGCE/QTS course (teacher training for secondary education), you will need to apply via Department for Education (DfE) Apply. Usually, we will email you with your login details for King’s Apply within a few days of receiving your PGCE application from DfE Apply. King’s Apply does not replace DfE Apply, but provides lots of useful features for King's applicants to use, and will be your main method of communication with our Admissions Office.\nAfter you have chosen a course by using our course finder, read the entry requirements to find out if you have the required qualifications to be considered (including English language and international requirements if relevant).\nThe individual webpage for your course also contains details of specific application procedures or required documents for your course. Equivalent international entry requirements can be found in the country dropdown list on the same page.\nFollow our key dates and information for the application process.\nConsider the availability of finances to cover both the tuition fees and living costs. Details are shown on the individual webpage for your course, which you can find on our course finder.\nAdditional funding opportunities at King’s and advice on other sources of funding can also be found on our postgraduate funding pages. Make sure you check for any early funding deadlines!\nPlease ensure that you send in all relevant documentation with your online application.\nIf you are unsure as to your fee status please see our policy pages.\nTo apply, you'll firstly need to register on our online application portal, King's Apply where you can submit your application online. This system is designed to support you through the application process. It will also be the main method by which you will communicate with the Admissions Office (via message) once you have applied.\nYou will receive emails from noreplyap@kcl.ac.uk when you create your account or submit an application. We strongly encourage you to save this as a contact so any emails do not go in to your junk/spam folders.\nYou will typically need to include:\nYour referee(s) will be emailed after you submit, so we recommend you letting them know to expect an email from King’s.\nSome courses require specific or additional information or reference to be submitted with the application e.g. writing sample/CV. Please check the ‘Entry requirements’ information on the individual webpage for your course, which you can find by using our course finder.\nPlease provide as much of the above documentation as you are able to do so upon submitting your application; including interim transcripts if you are still currently studying.\nWe will be in touch when assessing your application if we are missing required documentation, which may delay a decision being made. We however understand documents to meet your offer conditions, such as final academic transcripts and/or English language tests may not be immediately available, and not providing these at the point of submission will not hinder your application. If you are made a Conditional offer, the deadline to submit final documents will be detailed within your offer letter.\nMost of our postgraduate taught courses will require a non-refundable application fee before you can submit your application to be considered. This step is built into the online application process on King’s Apply. Please note that payment of an application fee is not a guarantee that you will receive an offer for your chosen course as many of our courses are competitive.\nNote: If you receive an offer, most of our postgraduate taught courses will also require a deposit payment to secure your offer. This is in addition to the application fee; however, the deposit is used as a partial payment of the tuition fees upon enrolling. Your offer letter will include details of any deposit you must pay, deadlines, and payment methods. You should not make a deposit payment unless instructed to as part of an offer.\nMost courses will start in September, which is the beginning of our academic year.\nWe usually open new applications from mid-October each year for the following September. Find your course through our course finder you will be able to find the application deadline and application closing date guidance under ‘Entry requirements’. Remember that separate (sometimes earlier) deadlines may apply for funding and scholarships.\nUsing King's Apply you can:\nMore information on how to track your application can be found on our 'after you've applied' webpage.\nYes, we do. If you are unsure of some of the terms we are referring to mean, please see our admissions glossary.\nIf your term is not available here, please contact us via message on King’s Apply.\nOnly under exceptional circumstances, and with the full support of your supervisor, it may be possible for you to undertake your research while living overseas. However, if this is agreed there are strict requirements that must be adhered to:\nMany our postgraduate courses are available for part-time study. Each individual course webpage will make clear if a course is available part-time, and/or by distance learning in the ‘Key information’ box.\nSome part-time courses run every other year, so do check the application guidance on the individual course pages.\nUniversity academic regulations do not permit you to study a course with us while also actively studying on another course at another university (except for Study Abroad students) or at King's (except for the AKC, those intercalating from an MBBS/BDS if approved by the respective Deans of Education, or those on a MD or PhD programme to study a PGCert only).\nIf you are currently taking qualifications elsewhere - including distance learning courses - and you are successful in receiving an offer for study at King's, you will be asked to provide evidence at registration that you have completed any previous studies or that you have interrupted/suspended your other study.\nFurther details can be found in the King’s Academic Manual (2.15-2.18 under 'Registration' in the 2024/5 version).\nThis will depend on the course you are applying to, please check the  course finder for specific requirements. For most courses work experience is not generally required and cannot usually be taken in lieu of academic qualifications, but any relevant work experience could add weight to your application. You can provide full details of your work experience in the 'Employment' section of the application form or in your personal statement if this is relevant to the course you are applying to.\nPlease note that some courses do have a certain number of years of work experience as a compulsory entry requirement, and this will be listed on the  course webpage where relevant.\nThis will not usually affect your application providing you can demonstrate a continued level of academic knowledge and interest in the subject area. To help evidence this, there may be additional requirements to support your application.\nWe will still require full transcripts and certificates for your studies; if for any reason you are unable to provide these, do ask your previous institution for any alternative documentation before contacting the Admissions Office on King’s Apply.\nYes, you can submit your English test results after submitting your application. If you are taking an English language test at a later date, please mark this on your application.\nWhen you have received your results, please scan and upload them to a message on King's Apply as soon as possible.\nIn most cases it is possible for us to make a conditional offer to those who do not have an acceptable English language test result when they apply. If we cannot make a decision without an English test result from you, we will request this from you as part of the application process.\nPlease see our postgraduate English language entry requirements for details.\nIf you apply and are successful in receiving an offer, you can accept your offer and pay your deposit on your King’s Apply account. The deposit is considered a partial payment towards your tuition fee upon enrolment.\nOur deposit amounts can vary depending on the programme you intend to study, but they are usually as follows:\nThe deposit amount is usually higher for our overseas fee status students due to the additional administration required to process these applications. This includes, but is not limited to, checks regarding eligibility to study in the UK, CAS number and student visa processing, ATAS, calculating transcripts and assessing qualification equivalencies to a UK Bachelor's (hons) degree. For offer holders who require a Student Visa from King’s, the deposit payment will be used in your CAS number to evidence your ability to pay the tuition fees as part of your visa application.\nFull details of the deposit terms and conditions, including how to show you are fully funded or when you can request a refund of a deposit payment, will be made available to you if you are successful in receiving an offer.\nYes, you can apply for more than one course in the same year. You will be required to pay the application fee for each course that requires this payment.\nFor postgraduate research: If you are submitting your own research, you will need to complete a new Research proposal and indicate a potential supervisor for each application\nIf you receive offers for more than one course, you will only be able to accept one of the offers.\nOnce you have completed an online application, you can click on 'new application' and create another application for a different course.\nYou cannot, however, make more than one application for the same course in an admissions cycle.\nWhile you cannot apply for the same course twice in the same cycle, you may wish to apply for a different course, or apply to the same course again next year.\nWe assess each application individually, and having previously applied will not hinder your new application.\nPlease note we cannot transfer information from previous submissions, and you will need to complete a new application in its entirety.\nWhere a student has previously enrolled on a course and been awarded (including an exit award or where credit has been awarded for one or more modules), or has been deemed an academic fail, they may not register for the same qualification in the same subject.\nThey may be able to register in a different subject provided that the procedures for enrolment are met, modules previously taken are not reattempted, and modules with substantially overlapping content are not taken.\nFurther details can be found in the King’s Academic Manual (2.20-2.22 under 'Registration' in the 2024/5 version).\nTo retrieve your password, please go to King’s Apply and underneath the ‘Login’ button you will see ‘Forgotten password?’.

We recommend that you login to check and send us a message on King's Apply if the details have not changed after 48 hours.\nIf you created your account on King’s Apply to submit an application form and your details change afterwards, you can make a number of changes yourself.\nClick on your name in the top right corner of King’s Apply:\nIf you have submitted the application form, please send a message through the King's Apply portal. The message should clearly detail where the mistake is. For example, if the referee contact details are incorrect, the message should make clear that the mistake concerns the 'References' section. You should then bring attention to the incorrect information and provide the correct information in the same message. The admissions team will endeavour to assess your application based on this corrected information.\nIf your application has been submitted and is under consideration, you should not send any additional documentation to what is required as part of the application. The Admissions Office will contact you through King’s Apply if they need further documents to assess your application.\nAll information relating to your application should be sent to Admissions.
