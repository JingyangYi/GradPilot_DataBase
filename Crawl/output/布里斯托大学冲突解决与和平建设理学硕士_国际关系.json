The programme arrives at a critical juncture, when global manifestations of conflict are both escalating and becoming more diverse, at the same time as the current conflict transformation and peacebuilding paradigm is under review. As it increasingly becomes evident that dominant forms of conflict resolution are inappropriate for resolving new and emerging forms of conflict, evolving drivers and manifestations of violent conflict in our changing world require new forms of expertise and innovative thinking and practice in conflict transformation. We need a better understanding of the varied impacts of conflict, the application of new technologies for conflict resolution, and how to advance more peaceful and just transitions.\nDrawing on insights from politics, international relations, sociology and law to understand framings of violent and other forms of conflict and responses to them, this interdisciplinary programme will equip students with the knowledge, expertise and skills to face the challenges of conflict and peacebuilding in the 21st century. While students will be made familiar with current arguments, theories and methodologies pertaining to conflict resolution and peacebuilding, the programme will offer critical and innovative perspectives on, and interdisciplinary methods to analyse the nature of violent conflict, the paths to its resolution/transformation, and the challenges and opportunities that we face today. Students will engage with diverse themes, such as conflict, security and development; conflict transformation in practice; conflict analysis and peacebuilding approaches; and transitional justice in the aftermath of conflict.\nThe programme will equip graduates for leadership roles in both the public and private sectors, at national and international levels, addressing the complex political, social, economic, legal and psychological factors driving emergent change. Essential practical skills will be incorporated throughout the programme to provide graduates with the necessary competencies to become pathfinders in navigating the complex challenges posed by conflict at the local and international level. The programme includes simulation exercises, guest public lectures by leading policymakers and practitioners, and innovative assessments. The programme will be taught by globally recognised experts in the field.\nYou will take a combination of mandatory and optional taught units within the School of Sociology, Politics and International Studies. Each unit is delivered over the course of 12 weeks and assessed by an analytical and research-based essay (or equivalent other work). The taught section of the programme is followed by a dissertation unit.\nThe University of Bristol is ranked fifth for research in the UK (Times Higher Education).\n94% of our research assessed as world-leading or internationally excellent.\nYou will typically need an upper second-class honours degree or an international equivalent in any discipline.\nIf you are currently completing a degree, we understand that your final grade may be higher than the interim grades or module/unit grades you have achieved during your studies to date.\nWe will consider your application if your interim grades are currently slightly lower than the programme's entry requirements and may make you an aspirational offer.
