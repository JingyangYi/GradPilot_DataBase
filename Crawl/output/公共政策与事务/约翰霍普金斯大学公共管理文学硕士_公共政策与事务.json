However, JHU’s international students in the United States on an F-1/J-1 Visa are required to purchase the university-sponsored student health benefits plan if they are enrolled with full-time status, defined as taking at least three courses per semester. Learn more about student health insurance.\nCourse Fees\nIn addition to tuition, some courses will require field trip, laboratory, technology, and thesis fees. These fees, specified in the Course Schedule for each semester/term, are payable at the same time as the regular tuition charges and are non-refundable.\nBilling Statement\nAll fees for each course will be itemized on your statement and listed separately from tuition. If you receive financial assistance, please check with your sponsor regarding reimbursement of tuition and fees. Please note that all fees are non-refundable. Full course tuition is due at the time of registration. All other fees are payable as noted below.\nTechnology Fee\nAll fully online and blended courses in AAP require an additional technology fee. This fee applies to all students registered in online classes, and it is not refundable.\nContinuation Courses Fee\nStudents who are in a thesis course and do not finish the thesis in the semester in which they enrolled for it must pay a continuation-of-enrollment fee of $500 for each subsequent semester/term until a final grade has been submitted. Students submit a registration form with payment to the Enrollment Office. This fee also allows students to continue using university facilities such as libraries, and the Johns Hopkins Enterprise Directory (JHED). Learn more about the particulars around this fee.\nLate Registration Fee\n\n\nThe Late Registration period is defined as the seven days prior to the start of classes and requires a $150 fee. Late registration does not apply for new students who were accepted for that term.\n\n\n\nCheck the Academic Calendar for late registration deadlines.\nThe Advanced Academic Programs Office of Enrollment Services is located at 555 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, D.C. 20001\nWe are open Monday through Thursday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. (6:30 p.m. during an open registration period) and Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. If you require registration assistance, please contact us.\nPlease note: New students registering for their first semester are exempt from this policy.\nGraduation Fee\nEvery graduate needs to pay the graduation fee, regardless of whether or not they plan to attend the ceremony. The graduation fee is $100 and is payable upon receipt of a bill from the Student Accounts office. Student Accounts sends this bill in October to students who completed degree requirements during the summer term; in March to those who completed requirements in the Fall, and in April to Spring graduates.\nRefund Policy\nStudents may elect to withdraw from one or more course(s) for a variety of reasons. Refunds are made in accordance with the Refund Schedule.\nSite Menu\nAudience Menu\nSearch\nEnter keyword\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter keyword...\n\n\n\nSubmit\n[GRID_TABLE]\nApplications Now Open\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTake the next step and apply for JHU’s upcoming Fall, Spring, or Summer Terms.\nApplications Now Open\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTake the next step and apply for JHU’s upcoming Fall, Spring, or Summer Terms.\nApplications Now Open\nTake the next step and apply for JHU’s upcoming Fall, Spring, or Summer Terms.",

The first half of the course focuses on establishing a framework in which to analyze public policy formulation within the United States. The class also reviews the tools for developing and implementing policy. The second half of the course turns to policy analysis of some critical contemporary issues. Building on earlier readings, we will study current debates in economic/tax policy, education, health care, social security, and national security. (Core requirement for the MA in Public Management.

The second half of the class will use these economic tools and theories in order to survey several specific policy areas, including health policy, tax policy, and the national debt.

This course will expose students to leadership models in America, starting with the founders and the conditions they set for future democratic leaders. In addition to examples of political leadership, students will study leadership in the area of social reform. Students will assess these models through primary readings, biographies, lectures, and film depictions. The course will help students to identify which models of creative leadership may be helpful in addressing current problems of contemporary politics\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNegotiating as a Leadership Skill - 470.638\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tConflict is part of organizational life. People in public sector agencies and nonprofit and for-profit organizations disagree over the meaning of regulations, the use of financial resources, office space, leave time, and many other issues. Managers must have the ability to diagnose disputes and to negotiate effectively to resolve conflicts. This course provides the theoretical background and conceptual framework needed for successful negotiation and mediation. Through presentations and discussions students become familiar with the tools necessary for conflict resolution in their agencies and organizations. Analysis of a party's interests, identification of the necessary style, awareness of communication skills, and planning and feedback are part of the process of becoming an accomplished negotiator.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFundamentals of Nonprofits and Nonprofit Management - 470.728\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe goal of this course is to convey the history, size and impact of the nonprofit sector while providing the fundamentals of nonprofit formation and management. In the United States, nonprofits are intertwined with our country's legal and tax systems, delivery of basic human services, and social, educational, health, environmental, equity issues and far more. Today, successful nonprofits require strong management systems, including management of finances, human resources, information technology, marketing, performance measures and other operational needs. The course will help the student understand the current thinking on best practices in managing and improving nonprofit organizations and appreciate the interplay of environmental and organizational factors that influence managerial decision-making. This course uses a simulation pedagogy that engages students in actively conceptualizing and building fictional nonprofit organizations. This is a core course for the nonprofit management program.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNonprofit Governance & Executive Leadership - 470.774\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t470.774 Nonprofit Governance & Executive Leadership: Students will advance their understanding of self-governing nonprofit organizations by focusing on nonprofit boards' expectations, challenges, and opportunities and their executive leadership. This course covers the primary responsibilities of nonprofit boards according to law, custom, and best practices, and it includes ethical concepts, public attitudes, and contemporary legislative and regulatory issues. The course explores theories of effective governance and executive leadership. It examines how ethical considerations relate to perceptions of excellence and shape how staff and volunteer leaders manage people and money. In the discussions, there will be opportunities to explore the roles of boards in the context of the nonprofit environment. This is a core course for the MA in Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) Management and Certificate in Nonprofit Management.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState Politics: A Year in the Life - 470.799\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState politics and policymaking offer a fascinating contrast to the gridlock in Washington that gets all the media attention. \nThis is a particularly timely issue to study as most states gear up for the new legislative session.

Examining the interactions of Congress with the other branches of government, the course also considers how presidents, the executive branch, and the judiciary interpret statutory language.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolitical Institutions and the Policy Process - 470.688\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBridging the divide between political science theories of policymaking and the actual workings of the policy process in the institutions of national government, this course examines the individual contributions of each of the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government as well as the interactions and struggles between those branches. How do these various institutions set the policy agenda, develop and deliberate policy alternatives, make authoritative policy decisions, and implement those decisions? In what ways are the interactions between these institutions best considered conflict or cooperation? Also, how do outside actors and institutions -- the media, interest groups, public opinion, parties and campaigns -- affect policymaking in these various institutional settings?

It exposes students to levels of strategy—grand strategy, strategy, operations, and tactics—in a national security context. The course will then focus on the practical implications and unique characteristics of military strategy. Students will critically examine topics such as civil-military relations, land warfare, naval warfare, theories of airpower, insurgency and counterinsurgency, and nuclear warfare. The goal is to understand the embedded assumptions of the various theories, the characteristics of the military capabilities animated by them, and, through discussion and case studies, the strengths and limitations of each.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade and Security - 470.744\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSince World War II, American trade policy has been implemented through agreements with a growing array of foreign governments to encourage global economic integration by lowering barriers to international trade. The course will begin with a look at the foundation of this approach to trade policy at the end of World War II and the relationship the Roosevelt and Truman administrations saw between integration and security policy. It will then introduce students to the American trade regime of the early 21st century and the WTO, and examine the ways the U.S. governments has adapted this regime to regional challenges arising from relationships with Japan, China, and the Muslim world, and to policy issues, like resource dependence, sanctions and export controls. The course will have a midterm exam on America’s trade regime and the concepts that have shaped it, and a final paper, in which students will examine an issue of their choice in depth.

With both populism and authoritarianism on the rise globally and polarization at high levels domestically, it has become especially urgent to understand what true democratic leadership entails – both its power and its limits. This course will expose students to leadership models in America, starting with the founders and the conditions they set for future democratic leaders. In addition to examples of political leadership, students will study leadership in the area of social reform. Students will assess these models through primary readings, biographies, lectures, and film depictions.

In the United States, nonprofits are intertwined with our country's legal and tax systems, delivery of basic human services, and social, educational, health, environmental, equity issues and far more. Today, successful nonprofits require strong management systems, including management of finances, human resources, information technology, marketing, performance measures and other operational needs. The course will help the student understand the current thinking on best practices in managing and improving nonprofit organizations and appreciate the interplay of environmental and organizational factors that influence managerial decision-making. This course uses a simulation pedagogy that engages students in actively conceptualizing and building fictional nonprofit organizations. This is a core course for the nonprofit management program.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNonprofit Governance & Executive Leadership - 470.774\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t470.774 Nonprofit Governance & Executive Leadership: Students will advance their understanding of self-governing nonprofit organizations by focusing on nonprofit boards' expectations, challenges, and opportunities and their executive leadership. This course covers the primary responsibilities of nonprofit boards according to law, custom, and best practices, and it includes ethical concepts, public attitudes, and contemporary legislative and regulatory issues. The course explores theories of effective governance and executive leadership. It examines how ethical considerations relate to perceptions of excellence and shape how staff and volunteer leaders manage people and money.

Focusing on the various stages of the legislative process, this course considers the expert and political sources of the legislative language in the U.S. Congress and the importance of language in coalition-building for policy passage. Examining the interactions of Congress with the other branches of government, the course also considers how presidents, the executive branch, and the judiciary interpret statutory language.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolitical Institutions and the Policy Process - 470.688\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBridging the divide between political science theories of policymaking and the actual workings of the policy process in the institutions of national government, this course examines the individual contributions of each of the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government as well as the interactions and struggles between those branches. How do these various institutions set the policy agenda, develop and deliberate policy alternatives, make authoritative policy decisions, and implement those decisions? In what ways are the interactions between these institutions best considered conflict or cooperation? Also, how do outside actors and institutions -- the media, interest groups, public opinion, parties and campaigns -- affect policymaking in these various institutional settings? Drawing on the Constitutional design and historical development of these institutions as well as contemporary practice, this course examines the purposes, processes, and outcomes of policymaking from an institutional perspective.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMilitary Strategy & National Policy - 470.692\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis course examines how states (primarily the United States) and other political entities harness military capabilities to pursue of policy objectives. It exposes students to levels of strategy—grand strategy, strategy, operations, and tactics—in a national security context. The course will then focus on the practical implications and unique characteristics of military strategy. Students will critically examine topics such as civil-military relations, land warfare, naval warfare, theories of airpower, insurgency and counterinsurgency, and nuclear warfare. The goal is to understand the embedded assumptions of the various theories, the characteristics of the military capabilities animated by them, and, through discussion and case studies, the strengths and limitations of each.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade and Security - 470.744\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSince World War II, American trade policy has been implemented through agreements with a growing array of foreign governments to encourage global economic integration by lowering barriers to international trade. The course will begin with a look at the foundation of this approach to trade policy at the end of World War II and the relationship the Roosevelt and Truman administrations saw between integration and security policy. It will then introduce students to the American trade regime of the early 21st century and the WTO, and examine the ways the U.S. governments has adapted this regime to regional challenges arising from relationships with Japan, China, and the Muslim world, and to policy issues, like resource dependence, sanctions and export controls. The course will have a midterm exam on America’s trade regime and the concepts that have shaped it, and a final paper, in which students will examine an issue of their choice in depth.
