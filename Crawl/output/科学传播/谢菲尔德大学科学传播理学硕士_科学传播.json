Science communicators are essential, and we want to train you to do it well.\nThis course will help you to develop the skills to communicate science effectively to a wide range of audiences. It's designed around developing you as a science communicator, rather than being a marketing course, and is taught by leading scientific researchers, professional science broadcasters, and experts from the School of Journalism, Media and Communication.\nThrough hands-on training, you’ll learn how to engage, educate and entertain people without the same specialist knowledge, covering the latest topics in science. You’ll target a range of different audiences, from science policy and business sectors, to the general public from all ages and backgrounds, giving you an insight into the breadth of potential science communication careers you could pursue.\nTraining can cover:\nBy completing these activities you’ll develop a range of skills and experience to include on your CV, whilst also building a portfolio of high quality science communication work that you can take to interviews.\nYour final project dissertation will allow you to put the skills you’ve learnt into practice and can be based around a print, broadcast or digital portfolio, an event you've organised or a work placement you've completed. Previous students have based their dissertation around work they've completed at organisations ranging from National Geographic, to the CERN research institute in Switzerland.\nThis is your opportunity to showcase your skills and independence, and gain additional experience to launch yourself into the next stage of your career.\nExample past research projects include:\nNo matter what your science background is, if you have a passion for science communication, this course is for you! Our students have studied undergraduate engineering, maths, physics, biology, chemistry, psychology, and everything in between. At Sheffield, you’ll be embedded in a diverse and supportive group of peers as you take your first steps towards your science communication career.\nScience Communication MSc Course Director and Senior Lecturer in the School of Biosciences\n“My academic research focuses on evolutionary biology, and the impact of environmental change on the natural world. I use the Pleistocene (aka ‘the Ice Age’) as a study system to consider these topics in a ‘real-world, real-time’ setting.\n“I also have a parallel career in science communication, with 20 years experience in the Museum sector and 10 years experience in specialist factual broadcasting. I have presented multiple TV series for Channel 4, National Geographic, PBS, and the Smithsonian Channel, radio series for BBC Radio 4, and I am an ARIA-award winning podcaster. I have science writing bylines in The Guardian, The Observer, CNN, The Evening Standard, and Nature.\n“My unconventional career path means I straddle the worlds of science AND science communication, with real-world experience and networks that span the industry – from broadcasting, to museums, to publishing – and this underpins my teaching. I can’t wait to share this with you all.”\nA selection of modules is available each year - some examples are below. There may be changes before you start your course. From May of the year of entry, formal programme regulations will be available in our Programme Regulations Finder.\nCore modules:\n\n\nEngaging with the Public\n\n\nIn this module you will work in a small group to plan, organise and deliver a public engagement or schools outreach event.  This will be based on a piece of research that has been or is being carried out in the Faculty of Science at the University of Sheffield.  The course will start with a series of workshops that cover the guiding principles of developing and delivering an effective and engaging science communication event.  This will include, among other things, audience and venue considerations, choosing a science topic, budgeting, risk assessment, contingency planning and evaluation.  You will also attend, reflect and report on a real-life public engagement event.  Finally you will, in your group, prepare the materials and resources required to stage an effective science event, deliver it to a public audience and critique its success.\n15 credits\n\n\nScience Communication Skills\n\n\nScience communication is a fast-paced and rapidly changing field. This module will introduce the latest technical, editing and media techniques needed to produce cutting edge visuals and audio for any online audience. The course will introduce a wide range of topics, designed to cover the huge breadth of science communication options in the Digital Age.\n30 credits\n\n\nResearch Methods\n\n\nThis module is designed as an introduction to social scientific research methods as applied in the communications, media and journalism fields.  The module provides an overview of key research methods, and the different ways in which research can be conducted.  Topics covered include surveys, questionnaire design, focus groups, interviewing, ethnography, content analysis, discourse analysis and different aspects of information search, reserach design, project management and research presentation.  The module is designed to make students aware of basic skills in these social science research methods and to equip them to conduct small scale projects on their own, or in groups.\n15 credits\n\n\nCommunicating with the Media\n\n\nThis module will provide students with knowledge and skills necessary to communicate messages through the media. Case studies and practical workshops will allow students to learn about the practice of media communication. They will learn how the media operates and how to communicate messages through interviews, press conferences and news releases. Topics covered in the module will include the development of communication strategies, the understanding of news values and news cycles and strategies for successful and ethical communication.\n15 credits\n\n\nTopical Science\n\n\nWhat are the current 'hot topics' in science? Why are these important? This module delivers the skills to take new scientific research and communicate it to a range of audiences. The module focuses on written communication, covering a broad spectrum of writing styles including news articles, opinion pieces, features and stories. The aim is to develop students' abilities to research and communicate exciting new scientific research both within and beyond their own areas of expertise.\n15 credits\n\n\nEthics and Regulation\n\n\nThis module examines some of the major ethical controversies in journalism. Students will explore debates about the tension between freedom of expression and the exercise of responsibility, and about the need to balance privacy rights with publishing material in the public interest. There will also be study of regulation, truth-telling, media representation of vulnerable groups and journalists' relationship with their sources. Students will explore how ethical behaviour is encouraged in journalism, and consider how the industry codes seek to achieve this in the UK.\n15 credits\n\n\nDealing with data for journalists\n\n\nNews reporting relies increasingly on knowing how to understand and analyse data. 'Now that information is abundant, processing is more important.' (Philip Meyer). Data science is the scientific discipline that feeds into this new type of journalism. It provides methods for collecting and systematizing data, which is then analysed using a combination of statistical and machine learning techniques, and finally presented in an appealing and understandable format. This module will equip students with the confidence to appreciate and apply the most widely used statistical techniques, which constitute the very core of data science and, hence, facilitate responsible evidence-based journalism.\n15 credits\n\n\nScience Communication Project\n\n\nThe project  exercise provides the student with a choice of three pathways to undertake a piece of scholarly research work in the area of Science Communication. These include critical analysis of the literature, developing experimental methods to test a hypothesis, or a practice based approach (which may include an optional work-placement).\n60 credits\nCore modules:\nIn this module you will work in a small group to plan, organise and deliver a public engagement or schools outreach event.  This will be based on a piece of research that has been or is being carried out in the Faculty of Science at the University of Sheffield.  The course will start with a series of workshops that cover the guiding principles of developing and delivering an effective and engaging science communication event.  This will include, among other things, audience and venue considerations, choosing a science topic, budgeting, risk assessment, contingency planning and evaluation.  You will also attend, reflect and report on a real-life public engagement event.  Finally you will, in your group, prepare the materials and resources required to stage an effective science event, deliver it to a public audience and critique its success.\nScience communication is a fast-paced and rapidly changing field.

I use the Pleistocene (aka ‘the Ice Age’) as a study system to consider these topics in a ‘real-world, real-time’ setting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“I also have a parallel career in science communication, with 20 years experience in the Museum sector and 10 years experience in specialist factual broadcasting. I have presented multiple TV series for Channel 4, National Geographic, PBS, and the Smithsonian Channel, radio series for BBC Radio 4, and I am an ARIA-award winning podcaster. I have science writing bylines in The Guardian, The Observer, CNN, The Evening Standard, and Nature.\n“My unconventional career path means I straddle the worlds of science AND science communication, with real-world experience and networks that span the industry – from broadcasting, to museums, to publishing – and this underpins my teaching. I can’t wait to share this with you all.”\n\n\n\n\n\nHear from four Science Communication MSc students, and Course Director Dr Tori Herridge to give you a feel for the skills you can gain on this course, the experts you’ll be learning from, and why Sheffield is such a great city to study in!\n\n\n\n\nModules\n\n\n\nA selection of modules is available each year - some examples are below. There may be changes before you start your course. From May of the year of entry, formal programme regulations will be available in our Programme Regulations Finder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      MSc modules\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Core modules:\n\n\nEngaging with the Public\n\n\nIn this module you will work in a small group to plan, organise and deliver a public engagement or schools outreach event.  This will be based on a piece of research that has been or is being carried out in the Faculty of Science at the University of Sheffield.  The course will start with a series of workshops that cover the guiding principles of developing and delivering an effective and engaging science communication event.  This will include, among other things, audience and venue considerations, choosing a science topic, budgeting, risk assessment, contingency planning and evaluation.  You will also attend, reflect and report on a real-life public engagement event.  Finally you will, in your group, prepare the materials and resources required to stage an effective science event, deliver it to a public audience and critique its success.\n15 credits\n\n\nScience Communication Skills\n\n\nScience communication is a fast-paced and rapidly changing field. This module will introduce the latest technical, editing and media techniques needed to produce cutting edge visuals and audio for any online audience. The course will introduce a wide range of topics, designed to cover the huge breadth of science communication options in the Digital Age.\n30 credits\n\n\nResearch Methods\n\n\nThis module is designed as an introduction to social scientific research methods as applied in the communications, media and journalism fields.  The module provides an overview of key research methods, and the different ways in which research can be conducted.  Topics covered include surveys, questionnaire design, focus groups, interviewing, ethnography, content analysis, discourse analysis and different aspects of information search, reserach design, project management and research presentation.  The module is designed to make students aware of basic skills in these social science research methods and to equip them to conduct small scale projects on their own, or in groups.\n15 credits\n\n\nCommunicating with the Media\n\n\nThis module will provide students with knowledge and skills necessary to communicate messages through the media. Case studies and practical workshops will allow students to learn about the practice of media communication. They will learn how the media operates and how to communicate messages through interviews, press conferences and news releases. Topics covered in the module will include the development of communication strategies, the understanding of news values and news cycles and strategies for successful and ethical communication.\n15 credits\n\n\nTopical Science\n\n\nWhat are the current 'hot topics' in science? Why are these important? This module delivers the skills to take new scientific research and communicate it to a range of audiences. The module focuses on written communication, covering a broad spectrum of writing styles including news articles, opinion pieces, features and stories. The aim is to develop students' abilities to research and communicate exciting new scientific research both within and beyond their own areas of expertise.\n15 credits\n\n\nEthics and Regulation\n\n\nThis module examines some of the major ethical controversies in journalism. Students will explore debates about the tension between freedom of expression and the exercise of responsibility, and about the need to balance privacy rights with publishing material in the public interest. There will also be study of regulation, truth-telling, media representation of vulnerable groups and journalists' relationship with their sources. Students will explore how ethical behaviour is encouraged in journalism, and consider how the industry codes seek to achieve this in the UK.\n15 credits\n\n\nDealing with data for journalists\n\n\nNews reporting relies increasingly on knowing how to understand and analyse data. 'Now that information is abundant, processing is more important.' (Philip Meyer). Data science is the scientific discipline that feeds into this new type of journalism. It provides methods for collecting and systematizing data, which is then analysed using a combination of statistical and machine learning techniques, and finally presented in an appealing and understandable format. This module will equip students with the confidence to appreciate and apply the most widely used statistical techniques, which constitute the very core of data science and, hence, facilitate responsible evidence-based journalism.\n15 credits\n\n\nScience Communication Project\n\n\nThe project  exercise provides the student with a choice of three pathways to undertake a piece of scholarly research work in the area of Science Communication. These include critical analysis of the literature, developing experimental methods to test a hypothesis, or a practice based approach (which may include an optional work-placement).\n60 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content of our courses is reviewed annually to make sure it's up-to-date and relevant.

I have science writing bylines in The Guardian, The Observer, CNN, The Evening Standard, and Nature.\n“My unconventional career path means I straddle the worlds of science AND science communication, with real-world experience and networks that span the industry – from broadcasting, to museums, to publishing – and this underpins my teaching. I can’t wait to share this with you all.”\n\n\n\n\n\nHear from four Science Communication MSc students, and Course Director Dr Tori Herridge to give you a feel for the skills you can gain on this course, the experts you’ll be learning from, and why Sheffield is such a great city to study in!\n\n\n\n\nModules\n\n\n\nA selection of modules is available each year - some examples are below. There may be changes before you start your course. From May of the year of entry, formal programme regulations will be available in our Programme Regulations Finder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      MSc modules\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Core modules:\n\n\nEngaging with the Public\n\n\nIn this module you will work in a small group to plan, organise and deliver a public engagement or schools outreach event.  This will be based on a piece of research that has been or is being carried out in the Faculty of Science at the University of Sheffield.  The course will start with a series of workshops that cover the guiding principles of developing and delivering an effective and engaging science communication event.  This will include, among other things, audience and venue considerations, choosing a science topic, budgeting, risk assessment, contingency planning and evaluation.  You will also attend, reflect and report on a real-life public engagement event.  Finally you will, in your group, prepare the materials and resources required to stage an effective science event, deliver it to a public audience and critique its success.\n15 credits\n\n\nScience Communication Skills\n\n\nScience communication is a fast-paced and rapidly changing field. This module will introduce the latest technical, editing and media techniques needed to produce cutting edge visuals and audio for any online audience. The course will introduce a wide range of topics, designed to cover the huge breadth of science communication options in the Digital Age.\n30 credits\n\n\nResearch Methods\n\n\nThis module is designed as an introduction to social scientific research methods as applied in the communications, media and journalism fields.  The module provides an overview of key research methods, and the different ways in which research can be conducted.  Topics covered include surveys, questionnaire design, focus groups, interviewing, ethnography, content analysis, discourse analysis and different aspects of information search, reserach design, project management and research presentation.  The module is designed to make students aware of basic skills in these social science research methods and to equip them to conduct small scale projects on their own, or in groups.\n15 credits\n\n\nCommunicating with the Media\n\n\nThis module will provide students with knowledge and skills necessary to communicate messages through the media. Case studies and practical workshops will allow students to learn about the practice of media communication. They will learn how the media operates and how to communicate messages through interviews, press conferences and news releases. Topics covered in the module will include the development of communication strategies, the understanding of news values and news cycles and strategies for successful and ethical communication.\n15 credits\n\n\nTopical Science\n\n\nWhat are the current 'hot topics' in science? Why are these important? This module delivers the skills to take new scientific research and communicate it to a range of audiences. The module focuses on written communication, covering a broad spectrum of writing styles including news articles, opinion pieces, features and stories. The aim is to develop students' abilities to research and communicate exciting new scientific research both within and beyond their own areas of expertise.\n15 credits\n\n\nEthics and Regulation\n\n\nThis module examines some of the major ethical controversies in journalism. Students will explore debates about the tension between freedom of expression and the exercise of responsibility, and about the need to balance privacy rights with publishing material in the public interest. There will also be study of regulation, truth-telling, media representation of vulnerable groups and journalists' relationship with their sources. Students will explore how ethical behaviour is encouraged in journalism, and consider how the industry codes seek to achieve this in the UK.\n15 credits\n\n\nDealing with data for journalists\n\n\nNews reporting relies increasingly on knowing how to understand and analyse data. 'Now that information is abundant, processing is more important.' (Philip Meyer). Data science is the scientific discipline that feeds into this new type of journalism. It provides methods for collecting and systematizing data, which is then analysed using a combination of statistical and machine learning techniques, and finally presented in an appealing and understandable format. This module will equip students with the confidence to appreciate and apply the most widely used statistical techniques, which constitute the very core of data science and, hence, facilitate responsible evidence-based journalism.\n15 credits\n\n\nScience Communication Project\n\n\nThe project  exercise provides the student with a choice of three pathways to undertake a piece of scholarly research work in the area of Science Communication. These include critical analysis of the literature, developing experimental methods to test a hypothesis, or a practice based approach (which may include an optional work-placement).\n60 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content of our courses is reviewed annually to make sure it's up-to-date and relevant.

There may be changes before you start your course. From May of the year of entry, formal programme regulations will be available in our Programme Regulations Finder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      MSc modules\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Core modules:\n\n\nEngaging with the Public\n\n\nIn this module you will work in a small group to plan, organise and deliver a public engagement or schools outreach event.  This will be based on a piece of research that has been or is being carried out in the Faculty of Science at the University of Sheffield.  The course will start with a series of workshops that cover the guiding principles of developing and delivering an effective and engaging science communication event.  This will include, among other things, audience and venue considerations, choosing a science topic, budgeting, risk assessment, contingency planning and evaluation.  You will also attend, reflect and report on a real-life public engagement event.  Finally you will, in your group, prepare the materials and resources required to stage an effective science event, deliver it to a public audience and critique its success.\n15 credits\n\n\nScience Communication Skills\n\n\nScience communication is a fast-paced and rapidly changing field. This module will introduce the latest technical, editing and media techniques needed to produce cutting edge visuals and audio for any online audience. The course will introduce a wide range of topics, designed to cover the huge breadth of science communication options in the Digital Age.\n30 credits\n\n\nResearch Methods\n\n\nThis module is designed as an introduction to social scientific research methods as applied in the communications, media and journalism fields.  The module provides an overview of key research methods, and the different ways in which research can be conducted.  Topics covered include surveys, questionnaire design, focus groups, interviewing, ethnography, content analysis, discourse analysis and different aspects of information search, reserach design, project management and research presentation.  The module is designed to make students aware of basic skills in these social science research methods and to equip them to conduct small scale projects on their own, or in groups.\n15 credits\n\n\nCommunicating with the Media\n\n\nThis module will provide students with knowledge and skills necessary to communicate messages through the media. Case studies and practical workshops will allow students to learn about the practice of media communication. They will learn how the media operates and how to communicate messages through interviews, press conferences and news releases. Topics covered in the module will include the development of communication strategies, the understanding of news values and news cycles and strategies for successful and ethical communication.\n15 credits\n\n\nTopical Science\n\n\nWhat are the current 'hot topics' in science? Why are these important? This module delivers the skills to take new scientific research and communicate it to a range of audiences.

The aim is to develop students' abilities to research and communicate exciting new scientific research both within and beyond their own areas of expertise.\n15 credits\n\n\nEthics and Regulation\n\n\nThis module examines some of the major ethical controversies in journalism. Students will explore debates about the tension between freedom of expression and the exercise of responsibility, and about the need to balance privacy rights with publishing material in the public interest. There will also be study of regulation, truth-telling, media representation of vulnerable groups and journalists' relationship with their sources. Students will explore how ethical behaviour is encouraged in journalism, and consider how the industry codes seek to achieve this in the UK.\n15 credits\n\n\nDealing with data for journalists\n\n\nNews reporting relies increasingly on knowing how to understand and analyse data. 'Now that information is abundant, processing is more important.' (Philip Meyer). Data science is the scientific discipline that feeds into this new type of journalism. It provides methods for collecting and systematizing data, which is then analysed using a combination of statistical and machine learning techniques, and finally presented in an appealing and understandable format. This module will equip students with the confidence to appreciate and apply the most widely used statistical techniques, which constitute the very core of data science and, hence, facilitate responsible evidence-based journalism.\n15 credits\n\n\nScience Communication Project\n\n\nThe project  exercise provides the student with a choice of three pathways to undertake a piece of scholarly research work in the area of Science Communication. These include critical analysis of the literature, developing experimental methods to test a hypothesis, or a practice based approach (which may include an optional work-placement).\n60 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content of our courses is reviewed annually to make sure it's up-to-date and relevant.

My project has been supervised by Professor Matt Field and Dr Amber Copeland in the School of Psychology and involves explaining their research conducted at the University of Sheffield.

The prominent models understood amongst the public and clinicians are moral models and the brain disease model of addiction. Research suggests both of these contribute to the stigma around the disorder, which worsens outcomes for people with addiction and prevents them from accessing support.

During her Science Communication MSc research project, Gemma was able to work with academics in the School of Psychology to create useful outputs informing different audiences about addiction.\n\n\nWhat does your project involve and what has been your experience?\nMy MSc final project is on creating forms of science communication about choice models of addiction. I have created three different outputs including a long form opinion piece article, an educational YouTube video and a clinician’s guide which aim to inform the public and medical professionals on these novel approaches to addiction. My project has been supervised by Professor Matt Field and Dr Amber Copeland in the School of Psychology and involves explaining their research conducted at the University of Sheffield. These are based on the role of value-based decision making in addiction and behavioural economic accounts. \nWhy is this research important and who will benefit?\nThe overall aims of the project are to fill the gap in science communication around addiction. The prominent models understood amongst the public and clinicians are moral models and the brain disease model of addiction. Research suggests both of these contribute to the stigma around the disorder, which worsens outcomes for people with addiction and prevents them from accessing support. Therefore informing the public on the current models is vital in improving public understanding of the disorder and highlighting the role of environment and social context in developing substance or alcohol use disorder. \nWhat are your future career plans and how do you feel this MSc will help you achieve these?\nIn the future I would love to go into science journalism to create engaging stories that accurately inform readers on the newest research and are accessible to all.

For students from England, the agency is Student Finance England.\nWhether you qualify for a postgraduate doctoral loan depends on your course, your age, and your nationality or residency status.\nYou will not be able to get a postgraduate doctoral loan if you already have a doctoral degree, or a qualification that’s equivalent or higher. You will also not be able to get a postgraduate doctoral loan if you’ve received or will receive Research Council funding (for example, studentships, stipends, scholarships and tuition fee support).\nThere are additional criteria that may mean you are not eligible for a postgraduate doctoral loan. For more information about eligibility, please refer to the government website.\nGov.uk - Doctoral loan - Eligibility\nYour course must be a full, standalone doctoral course, have started on or after 1 August 2018, last between 3 to 8 academic years, and be provided by a university in the UK with research degree awarding powers.\nIt can be full-time or part-time and taught or research-based (or a combination of both).\nYou can apply for a loan if your doctoral programme includes an integrated master’s degree (even if you already have a master’s degree). You must register for a full doctoral degree.\nYou can qualify for a loan if you are undertaking distance learning, depending on whether you meet the relevant eligibility criteria.\nFor more information about eligibility, please refer to the government website.\nYou must be under 60 on the first day of the first academic year of your course.\nThe academic year is a period of 12 months starting on:\nWhether you qualify for a loan depends on your nationality or residency status.\nA postgraduate doctoral loan can help with course fees and living costs while you study a postgraduate doctoral course.\nThe amount you’ll get is not based on your income or your family’s. If you are starting your course in the academic year 2025-2026, you can borrow up to £30,301.\nA lower amount of loan is available if you are already registered on a course:\nYou can apply for a postgraduate doctoral loan in any year of your course but if you apply after your first year, you might not get the maximum amount.\nFor more information on what you’ll get, please refer to the government website.\nGov.uk - Doctoral loan - What you’ll get\nThe loan will be divided equally across each year of your course. The loan will be paid directly to you.\nAfter your application has been approved, you’ll be sent a letter with your payment dates. You can also check them in your online account. The loan will be paid directly to you in three instalments of 33%, 33% and 34% each year. You get the first payment after your course start date, once the University confirms that you’ve registered.\nApplications usually open in the May or June before you start your course.\nYou only need to apply once for a postgraduate doctoral loan for your course.\nYou need to apply within 9 months of the first day of the last academic year of the course.\nFor more information, please refer to the government website.\nGov.uk - Doctoral loan - How to apply\nLoan repayments will usually commence from the April after course completion at the earliest (or the April 4 years after the course started if you’re studying part-time and your course is longer than 4 years) and only when your income is over the repayment threshold set by the government: this is currently £21,000 a year for postgraduate loan repayment plans.\nGov.uk - Repaying your student loan - When you start repaying\nYour repayments will be taken out of your salary at the same time as tax and National Insurance if you’re an employee. Your payslips will show how much has been deducted. If you're self-employed, you'll pay through HM Revenue and Customs.\nGov.uk - Repaying your student loan - How to repay\nHow much you repay depends on your income. You’ll repay a percentage of your income over the repayment threshold set by the government (currently £21,000 for postgraduate loan repayment plans).\nThe doctoral loan repayment will be calculated at 6% of income above the repayment threshold.\nRepayments will be made concurrently alongside repayment of any outstanding undergraduate student loan.\nYour repayments are based on what you earn, not what you owe.

When this is ready we'll send you an email containing your applicant and choice numbers. You should normally receive this email within two working days. We'll then send your application for academic consideration.\nYou can check the progress of your application at any time simply by logging back into your online application.\nIf we need to contact you we'll do so by email, so please make sure that you check the email account you used for your application, and that this account is set to trust messages coming from @shef.ac.uk and @sheffield.ac.uk addresses. You may wish to add admissions@sheffield.ac.uk to your address book to avoid important messages being marked as spam.\nIf you change your email address, please let us know by emailing us at admissions@sheffield.ac.uk, including your full name and applicant number.\nFor most taught courses, it normally takes academic departments around four weeks to make decisions on applications. It can take longer at busy times.\nFor some of our courses, we may invite you to attend an interview with staff from your academic department. You can find information on what to expect in an interview in our guidance:\nWhen we've made our decision, it will appear in your online application, and we'll also send you an email to confirm this.\nIf we've offered you a study place, we'll provide you with an official electronic offer letter detailing any conditions and the amount payable for the tuition fees. The offer letter will be attached to our email and also available for you to download from your online application.\nIf we haven't offered you a study place and you would like feedback on this decision, you should contact the academic department directly in writing. You can find their contact details under the relevant entry in our postgraduate taught course listings.\nIf we make you an offer, it will be either Conditional or Unconditional.\nA Conditional offer means that there are requirements that you need to meet before you can start the course, for example a certain English language score, or a minimum grade in your current studies.\nAn Unconditional offer means that there are no further academic requirements that you need to meet.\nIf we've made you a Conditional offer, the conditions will be stated in your offer letter. When you've met these conditions, you should upload to your online application documents that prove it.
