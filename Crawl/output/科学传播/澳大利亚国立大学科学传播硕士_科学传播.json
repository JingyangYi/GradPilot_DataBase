The higher of the two calculations will be used as the basis for admission.\nCognate Disciplines: Mathematical Sciences, Physics and Astronomy, Chemical Sciences, Earth Sciences, Biological Sciences, Environmental Studies, Other Natural and Physical Sciences, Information Technology, Engineering and Related Technologies, Health, Education, Communication and Media\nRanking and English Proficiency: At a minimum, all applicants must meet program-specific academic/non-academic requirements, and English language requirements. Admission to most ANU programs is on a competitive basis. Therefore, meeting all admission requirements does not automatically guarantee entry.\nIn line with the University's admissions policy and strategic plan, an assessment for admission may include competitively ranking applicants on the basis of specific academic achievement, English language proficiency and diversity factors. Applicants will first be ranked on a GPA ('GPA1') that is calculated using all but the last semester (or equivalent) of the Bachelor degree used for admission purposes. If required, ranking may further be confirmed on the basis of:\nPrior to enrolment in this ANU program, all students who gain entry will have their Bachelor degree reassessed, to confirm minimum requirements were met.\nFurther information: English language admission requirements and post-admission support\nDiversity factors: As Australia’s national university, ANU is global representative of Australian research and education. ANU endeavours to recruit and maintain a diverse and deliberate student cohort representative not only of Australia, but the world. In order to achieve these outcomes, competitive ranking of applicants may be adjusted to ensure access to ANU is a reality for brilliant students from countries across the globe.\nAssessment of qualifications: Unless otherwise indicated, ANU will accept all Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF) qualifications or international equivalents that meet or exceed the published admission requirements of our programs, provided all other admission requirements are also met.\nWhere an applicant has more than one completed tertiary qualification, ANU will base assessment on the qualification that best meets the admission requirements for the program. Find out more about the Australian Qualifications Framework: www.aqf.edu.au\nANU uses a 7-point Grade Point Average (GPA) scale. All qualifications submitted for admission at ANU will be converted to this common scale, which will determine if an applicant meets our published admission requirements. Find out more about how a 7-point GPA is calculated for Australian universities: www.uac.edu.au/future-applicants/admission-criteria/tertiary-qualifications\nUnless otherwise indicated, where an applicant has more than one completed tertiary qualification, ANU will calculate the GPA for each qualification separately. ANU will base assessment on the best GPA of all completed tertiary qualifications of the same level or higher.\nApplications for course credit: Applicants with a Bachelor Degree or Graduate Certificate in a cognate discipline may be eligible for up to 24 units (one semester) of credit.\nApplicants with a Graduate Diploma or Bachelor degree with Honours in a cognate discipline may be eligible for up to 48 units (one year) of credit.\nDomestic Tuition Fees (DTF)\nFor more information see: http://www.anu.edu.au/students/program-administration/costs-fees\nFor further information on International Tuition Fees see: https://www.anu.edu.au/students/program-administration/fees-payments/international-tuition-fees\nAll students are required to pay the Services and amenities fee (SA Fee)\nThe annual indicative fee provides an estimate of the program tuition fees for international students and domestic students (where applicable). The annual indicative fee for a program is based on the standard full-time enrolment load of 48 units per year (unless the program duration is less than 48 units). Fees for courses vary by discipline meaning that the fees for a program can vary depending on the courses selected. Course fees are reviewed on an annual basis and typically will increase from year to year. The tuition fees payable are dependent on the year of commencement and the courses selected and are subject to increase during the period of study.\nFor further information on Fees and Payment please see: https://www.anu.edu.au/students/program-administration/fees-payments\nANU offers a wide range of scholarships to students to assist with the cost of their studies.\nEligibility to apply for ANU scholarships varies depending on the specifics of the scholarship and can be categorised by the type of student you are.  Specific scholarship application process information is included in the relevant scholarship listing.\nFor further information see the Scholarships website.\nOur unique Masters program allows you to design your own science communication degree, tailoring your studies towards a range of science communication careers and broader scientific leadership roles.

Prerequisites can include a high school subject or a university unit of study, which would be required to study that program or course in a program.\nThis is a grouping of schools according to academic disciplines, where academic staff teach at undergraduate, graduate and higher degree levels and pursue research and scholarly investigations.\nThey are University approved accommodation.  To find out more, visit the Residential and Campus Communities website.\nAustralian Tertiary Admissions Rank. The figure used by universities and tertiary applications centres such as UAC/VTAC to calculate the university entrance rank.This is then used to determine eligibility for admission to undergraduate courses. This is not a mark, but rank in comparison to other students.\nAn area within a program that allows in-depth study in a particular field. A major usually consists of a set number of related courses. Majors at ANU require 48 units.Example: The Marketing Major requires 48 units of courses specified under the requirements for the Marketing Major.\nA minor has fewer requirements to fulfil than a major, in terms of points and compulsory courses. Minors at ANU require 24 units.Example: The French Minor requires 24 units of courses specified under the requirements for the French Minor.\nSimilar to minors, specialisations are areas of studies with their own courses that are allowed to be taken in conjunction with a specific related major.Example: The Astronomy and Astrophysics specialisation requires 24 units of courses and is available to students who complete a Physics Major, Theoretical Physics Major, Mathematics Major or Mathematical Modelling Major.\nAn optional area of study selected in addition to the core courses of the program. Electives may allow you to delve more deeply into an area of study, or focus on an alternative area of interest that you may have. Many people will use electives to complete an additional major or minor.\nEach university has different terminology to describe their programs and the specific requirements of those programs. Some of these terms are “units”, “subjects” and “courses”, and whilst some terms are interchangeable, at ANU there is a general understanding of what these terms mean:>> Course: An area of study usually of one semester in length. Each course is normally assigned a unit value.Example: COMP1100 Introduction to Programming and Algorithms.>> Unit: a unit is an indicator of the value of a course – most courses are valued at 6 units.\nSome institutions assume that you have knowledge of specified courses or equivalent before beginning your course. If you do not have the assumed level of knowledge, but have met the admission requirements you may still be selected for the course, but you may have some difficulty coping with your studies. You may need to do a bridging course if you do not have the assumed level of knowledge.\nThese courses are designed to help you to get up to speed if you lack the assumed knowledge to start your program. They offer students the opportunity to revise and extend their knowledge in specific areas – often in chemistry, mathematics and physics. While they are strongly recommended for commencing students, they are not prerequisites.\nResponsible Officer: Registrar, Student Administration / Page Contact: Website Administrator / Frequently Asked Questions\n• Search ANU web, staff & maps\n\nSearch current site content\n• Search current site content\n• Programs and Courses\n• Frequently Asked Questions",

The course allows students to choose from a range of one-year intensive fieldwork placements at some of Australia’s leading science engagement organisations. Students explore the fundamental theory that underpins science communication in such settings, then apply it to deliver, evaluate and improve existing programs, develop novel programs and work on other suitable priorities of the fieldwork host – including working alongside and learning from their staff.\nTo see current fieldwork placement opportunities see the 'Class' tab. For more details, see all work-integrated learning opportunities the Australian National Centre for the Public Awareness of Science.\nUpon successful completion, students will have the knowledge and skills to:\nCurrent fieldwork hosts can be found in the class scheduling information. Please visit the Centre for the Public Awareness of Science website for further details of what fieldwork placements may involve and the application process. If you are a science communication organisation that would like to host ANU students, or a potential applicant with a suggested fieldwork host, please contact the course convenor.\nAs placements are limited, students must apply by September 30 (round 1) or November 30 (round 2 - only run if spaces remain) in the year prior to study by submitting:\nPlease email to graham.walker@anu.edu.au and cpas@anu.edu.au; NOTE for students applying for a degree program at the same time please also upload these documents via the relevant Application Portal.\nLate applications may be considered, please contact the course convenor.\nFollowing review of applications, there will be an interview process including a short science communication audition activity (e.g. a brief talk or demonstration). Applications and interviews will be assessed on applicant's creativity and originality, motivation for applying, existing skills and knowledge, qualifications, interpersonal skills, past experience, ambition and adaptability. Contact the course convenor for more details.\nThe ANU uses Turnitin to enhance student citation and referencing techniques, and to assess assignment submissions as a component of the University's approach to managing Academic Integrity. While the use of Turnitin is not mandatory, the ANU highly recommends Turnitin is used by both teaching staff and students. For additional information regarding Turnitin please visit the ANU Online website.\nThis course is to be enrolled in as 12 units + 12 units across two consecutive Semesters, commencing in Semester 1 and concluding in Semester 2 of the same year, in one fieldwork placement.\nThe expected workload will consist of approximately 260 hours per semester of which approximately 10% consists of lectures and other ANU-led teaching, with the rest split between team/location-based activity with the fieldwork host and independent self-study, assignments, fieldwork specific lectures and workshops, and individual/team fieldwork – the exact split of this will depend on the nature of fieldwork tasks.\nDuring this course, students learn skills associated with science engagement activities. This includes:\nStudents who cannot meet these requirements will not be able to pass compulsory assessment tasks and therefore will not be able to pass the course.\nDuring this course, students must participate in work-integrated learning which may include science engagement programs, events and other activities organised by our fieldwork hosts. In order to participate in these activities, students are required to:\nStudents who cannot complete these requirements will not be able to participate in the work-integrated learning and therefore cannot pass the course.\nStudents are also typically expected to contribute to the practical operations of the fieldwork hosts activity by:\nStudents who cannot meet these requirements will need to have an exemption approved by the course convenor. As this cannot be guaranteed in all circumstances, students are strongly encouraged to discuss their circumstances with the course convenor before enrolling in this course.\nYou will need to contact the Centre for the Public Awareness of Science to request a permission code to enrol in this course.\nExperience in real-world science communication activities as a volunteer or professionally is helpful but by no means essential - thorough tuition and training will be provided.\nTuition fees are for the academic year indicated at the top of the page.\nCommonwealth Support (CSP) StudentsIf you have been offered a Commonwealth supported place, your fees are set by the Australian Government for each course. At ANU 1 EFTSL is 48 units (normally 8 x 6-unit courses). More information about your student contribution amount for each course at Fees.\nIf you are a domestic graduate coursework student with a Domestic Tuition Fee (DTF) place or international student you will be required to pay course tuition fees (see below). Course tuition fees are indexed annually. Further information for domestic and international students about tuition and other fees can be found at Fees.\nWhere there is a unit range displayed for this course, not all unit options below may be available.\nANU utilises MyTimetable to enable students to view the timetable for their enrolled courses, browse, then self-allocate to small teaching activities / tutorials so they can better plan their time.

Check 'Other Information' for application deadline and details.\nStudents in this course develop their science communication skills in authentic science engagement settings, creating real-world impact and building networks and pathways to support career development. The course allows students to choose from a range of one-year intensive fieldwork placements at some of Australia’s leading science engagement organisations. Students explore the fundamental theory that underpins science communication in such settings, then apply it to deliver, evaluate and improve existing programs, develop novel programs and work on other suitable priorities of the fieldwork host – including working alongside and learning from their staff.\nTo see current fieldwork placement opportunities see the 'Class' tab. For more details, see all work-integrated learning opportunities the Australian National Centre for the Public Awareness of Science.\nUpon successful completion, students will have the knowledge and skills to:\nAll students engage with WIL partners (internal/external) as a major component of the course\nCurrent fieldwork hosts can be found in the class summary information. Please visit the Centre for the Public Awareness of Science website for further details of what fieldwork placements may involve and the application process. Note to take a placement at Questacon, due to Australian Government security regulations students must be an Australian citizen. If you are a science communication organisation that would like to host ANU students, or a potential applicant with a suggested fieldwork host, please contact the course convenor.\nAs placements are limited, students must apply by September 30 (round 1) or November 30 (round 2 - only run if spaces remain) in the year prior to study by submitting:\nPlease email to graham.walker@anu.edu.au and cpas@anu.edu.au\nNOTE for students applying for a degree program at the same time please also upload these documents via the relevant application portal. Late applications may be considered, please contact the course convenor.\nFollowing review of applications, there will be an interview process including a short science communication audition activity (e.g. a brief talk or demonstration). Applications and interviews will be assessed on applicant's creativity and originality, motivation for applying, existing skills and knowledge, qualifications, interpersonal skills, past experience, ambition and adaptability. Contact the course convenor for more details.\nAdditional considerations\nStudents are typically expected to contribute to the practical operations of the fieldwork hosts activity by:\nStudents who cannot meet these requirements will need to have an exemption approved by the course convenor. As this cannot be guaranteed in all circumstances, students are strongly encouraged to discuss their circumstances with the course convenor before enrolling in this course.\nThe ANU uses Turnitin to enhance student citation and referencing techniques, and to assess assignment submissions as a component of the University's approach to managing Academic Integrity. While the use of Turnitin is not mandatory, the ANU highly recommends Turnitin is used by both teaching staff and students. For additional information regarding Turnitin please visit the ANU Online website.\nThe expected workload is approximately 130 hours of total student learning time per 6 units of enrolment. Note this course is to be enrolled in as 12 units + 12 units across two consecutive semesters, commencing in Semester 1 and concluding in Semester 2 of the same year, in one fieldwork placement.\nEnrolment will consist of approximately 520 hours (24 units) over semester 1 and 2 in one calendar year including:\nDuring this course, students learn skills associated with science engagement activities. Depending on placement locations, this may include:\nStudents who cannot meet these requirements will not be able to pass compulsory assessment tasks and therefore will not be able to pass the course.\nDuring this course, students must participate in work-integrated learning which may include science engagement programs, events and other activities organised by our fieldwork hosts. In order to participate in these activities, students are required to:\nStudents who cannot complete these requirements will not be able to participate in the work-integrated learning and therefore cannot pass the course.\nPlease see \"Other information\" field for additional considerations and enrolment information.\nYou will need to contact the Centre for the Public Awareness of Science to request a permission code to enrol in this course.\nExperience in real-world science communication activities as a volunteer or professionally is helpful but by no means essential - thorough tuition and training will be provided.\nTuition fees are for the academic year indicated at the top of the page.\nCommonwealth Support (CSP) StudentsIf you have been offered a Commonwealth supported place, your fees are set by the Australian Government for each course. At ANU 1 EFTSL is 48 units (normally 8 x 6-unit courses). More information about your student contribution amount for each course at Fees.\nIf you are a domestic graduate coursework student with a Domestic Tuition Fee (DTF) place or international student you will be required to pay course tuition fees (see below). Course tuition fees are indexed annually. Further information for domestic and international students about tuition and other fees can be found at Fees.\nWhere there is a unit range displayed for this course, not all unit options below may be available.\nANU utilises MyTimetable to enable students to view the timetable for their enrolled courses, browse, then self-allocate to small teaching activities / tutorials so they can better plan their time.

The higher of the two calculations will be used as the basis for admission.\nCognate Disciplines: Mathematical Sciences, Physics and Astronomy, Chemical Sciences, Earth Sciences, Biological Sciences, Environmental Studies, Other Natural and Physical Sciences, Information Technology, Engineering and Related Technologies, Health, Education, Communication and Media\nRanking and English Proficiency: At a minimum, all applicants must meet program-specific academic/non-academic requirements, and English language requirements. Admission to most ANU programs is on a competitive basis. Therefore, meeting all admission requirements does not automatically guarantee entry.\nIn line with the University's admissions policy and strategic plan, an assessment for admission may include competitively ranking applicants on the basis of specific academic achievement, English language proficiency and diversity factors. Applicants will first be ranked on a GPA ('GPA1') that is calculated using all but the last semester (or equivalent) of the Bachelor degree used for admission purposes. If required, ranking may further be confirmed on the basis of:\nPrior to enrolment in this ANU program, all students who gain entry will have their Bachelor degree reassessed, to confirm minimum requirements were met.\nFurther information: English language admission requirements and post-admission support\nDiversity factors: As Australia’s national university, ANU is global representative of Australian research and education. ANU endeavours to recruit and maintain a diverse and deliberate student cohort representative not only of Australia, but the world. In order to achieve these outcomes, competitive ranking of applicants may be adjusted to ensure access to ANU is a reality for brilliant students from countries across the globe.\nAssessment of qualifications: Unless otherwise indicated, ANU will accept all Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF) qualifications or international equivalents that meet or exceed the published admission requirements of our programs, provided all other admission requirements are also met.\nWhere an applicant has more than one completed tertiary qualification, ANU will base assessment on the qualification that best meets the admission requirements for the program. Find out more about the Australian Qualifications Framework: www.aqf.edu.au\nANU uses a 7-point Grade Point Average (GPA) scale. All qualifications submitted for admission at ANU will be converted to this common scale, which will determine if an applicant meets our published admission requirements. Find out more about how a 7-point GPA is calculated for Australian universities: www.uac.edu.au/future-applicants/admission-criteria/tertiary-qualifications\nUnless otherwise indicated, where an applicant has more than one completed tertiary qualification, ANU will calculate the GPA for each qualification separately. ANU will base assessment on the best GPA of all completed tertiary qualifications of the same level or higher.\nApplications for course credit: Applicants with a Bachelor Degree or Graduate Certificate in a cognate discipline may be eligible for up to 24 units (one semester) of credit.\nApplicants with a Graduate Diploma or Bachelor degree with Honours in a cognate discipline may be eligible for up to 48 units (one year) of credit.\nDomestic Tuition Fees (DTF)\nFor more information see: http://www.anu.edu.au/students/program-administration/costs-fees\nFor further information on International Tuition Fees see: https://www.anu.edu.au/students/program-administration/fees-payments/international-tuition-fees\nAll students are required to pay the Services and amenities fee (SA Fee)\nThe annual indicative fee provides an estimate of the program tuition fees for international students and domestic students (where applicable). The annual indicative fee for a program is based on the standard full-time enrolment load of 48 units per year (unless the program duration is less than 48 units). Fees for courses vary by discipline meaning that the fees for a program can vary depending on the courses selected. Course fees are reviewed on an annual basis and typically will increase from year to year.
