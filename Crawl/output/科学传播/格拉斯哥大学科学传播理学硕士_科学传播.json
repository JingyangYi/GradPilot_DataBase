Sie können Ihre individuellen Studieninteressen verfolgen und sich fachlich wie auch persönlich weiterentwickeln.\nSie können sich bewerben, wenn Sie einen Masterabschluss (oder Äquivalent) an einer Hochschule im Ausland erwerben möchten.\nEine Bewerbung ist auch möglich, wenn Sie nicht die deutsche Staatsangehörigkeit haben. Die Voraussetzungen finden Sie in unseren wichtigen Stipendienhinweisen unter Abschnitt A, Punkt 1.\nDas Programm richtet sich an alle wissenschaftlichen Fachrichtungen. Bitte beachten Sie: Zur Weiterbildung in künstlerischen Fachbereichen und dem Fachbereich Architektur sowie für ein LL.M.(Master of Laws)-Aufbaustudium bietet der DAAD eigene Stipendienprogramme an:\nGefördert wird die Teilnahme an einem Masterstudiengang mit Abschluss an einer Hochschule im Ausland.\nDas Stipendium gilt, je nach Dauer des Studienprogramms, für ein oder zwei Studienjahre (maximal 24 Monate).\r\nBitte geben Sie bei Ihrer Bewerbung den gesamten Zeitraum an, für den Sie das Stipendium beantragen wollen. Wenn Sie bspw. einen 2-jährigen Studiengang planen, müssen Sie bei der Bewerbung als gewünschte Stipendiendauer direkt zwei Jahre angeben. Nach dem ersten Studienjahr werden Ihre erbrachten Studienleistungen dann in einem Weiterförderungsverfahren begutachtet. Geht daraus hervor, dass Sie Ihr Studium in einem vertretbaren zeitlichen Rahmen erfolgreich abschließen werden, läuft das Stipendium wie geplant weiter.\r\nFalls Sie sich zum Zeitpunkt der Bewerbung bereits im ersten Studienjahr eines 2-jährigen Master- oder Aufbaustudiengangs im Ausland befinden, können Sie sich um ein Stipendium für das zweite Studienjahr bewerben. Eine Verlängerung des Stipendiums ist in diesem Fall nicht möglich.\nDas Stipendium umfasst die folgenden Leistungen:\nBitte prüfen Sie, ob Sie folgende Kriterien erfüllen:\nNach einer ersten Vorauswahl auf Basis der eingereichten Unterlagen werden die erfolgreichen Bewerberinnen und Bewerber zu einer persönlichen Vorstellung vor der Auswahlkommission eingeladen. \r\nBei einem sehr hohen Bewerbungsaufkommen kann die Vorauswahl zweistufig erfolgen: Im ersten Schritt werden die Studienleistungen unter Berücksichtigung der individuellen, besonderen Lebensumstände betrachtet. Im zweiten Schritt erfolgt eine umfassende Bewertung der Bewerbungen durch die jeweils fachlich zuständigen Auswahlkommissionsmitglieder.\r\nDie persönliche Vorstellung kann beim DAAD in Bonn oder auch virtuell stattfinden. Schauen Sie auch unser Video über das Stipendien-Auswahlverfahren an.\r\nDie Auswahlkommissionen setzen sich nach fachlichen und ggf. regionalen Gesichtspunkten zusammen. Die ehrenamtlichen Kommissionsmitglieder werden vom Vorstand des DAAD berufen und sind in erster Linie Hochschullehrende deutscher Hochschulen. Sie begutachten die Bewerbungen und entscheiden über die Stipendienvergabe. An der Auswahl können auch ehemalige DAAD-Stipendiatinnen und -Stipendiaten beteiligt sein. Mitarbeitende des DAAD leiten die Auswahlsitzung, haben jedoch kein Stimmrecht.\r\nWeitere Informationen finden Sie in unseren wichtigen Stipendienhinweisen im Abschnitt C.\nBesonders berücksichtigt werden:\nNach der Anmeldung im DAAD-Portal füllen Sie bitte die Online-Bewerbung vollständig aus. Die unten aufgelisteten Bewerbungsdokumente laden Sie anschließend im DAAD-Portal im Bereich „Anlagen“ hoch.

Organization as a patient administrator at the limb reconstruction centre, as part of the trauma and emergency team and was tragically killed in Gaza in November 2023.  The Scholarship is open to a Palestinian National who is living in or has been forced to leave the State of Palestine due to humanitarian reasons. The chosen applicant may be domiciled in any country but must be a Palestinian National.  The scholarship is open to prospective undergraduate and postgraduate taught applicants to the University of Glasgow applying for entry in September 2025/26.\nUniversity of Glasgow is committed to support as many self-funded students as possible which is why UofG discounts and scholarships cannot be combined with one another or any external sponsorship discounts (with the exception of Alumni Discount).\nIf you are offered more than 1 scholarship, the lower value award will be deleted from your account.\nIf you are unsure of whether you are eligible to apply, please
