Does science communication matter for society? Whose interests are furthered by science news? What are the ethical issues in the communication of health research? When we talk about public engagement, what kind of public do we mean?\nYou will consider these and other questions through insights drawn from history, innovation and policy research, media studies, and the first-hand experience of long-serving communicators, and link these to practical skills.\nPhD with integrated master's\nIf you're planning to undertake a PhD after your master's, our       Integrated PhD programme\n will enable you to combine your postgraduate taught course with a related PhD project in biology, medicine or health.\nBringing academic and practitioner expertise together\nWe believe that learning from both theory and practice makes for better science and health communicators. Throughout the course, we bring practitioners into the classroom, and enable you to participate in the various forms of science and health communication that take place in and around Manchester.\nYou will learn through a mixture of lectures, small-group seminars, discussions and practical exercises. Activities will be included in the taught elements for both individual students and groups.\nYou will engage with primary and secondary academic literatures, professional literatures, and mass media products about science, technology and medicine.\nYou will also learn at special sites of science and health communication, such as museums, media institutions, and public events.\nWe encourage participation and volunteering to help you further your own interests alongside the taught curriculum. All students will meet regularly with a student mentor from the Centre's PhD community, with a designated personal tutor from among the staff and academic supervisors for your mentored and research projects.\nApplicants may informally request examples of study materials to help you test your ability to engage effectively with the course from the Course Director.\nThe full-time version of the course runs for 12 months from September. There is also a part-time alternative that runs for two years. Part-time study involves a limited number of days' attendance per week and can be combined with employment.\nAll students take three course units consisting of weekly lectures and discussion seminars:\nAll students also attend a series of specialised courses focusing on science and health communication practice and science policy, with sessions led by invited contributors including journalists, media creators and producers, museum professionals, policy analysts, outreach officers and other relevant experts. You will choose       two of the following four units\n to specialise in for assessed work (although you can sit in on all these units):\nOur course teaches the current trends in science communication, so details of our units may vary from year to year to stay up to date. This type of change is covered within the University's       disclaimer\n, but if you are in doubt about a unit of interest, please contact us before accepting your offer of a place.\nThe course is completed by two more open-ended elements allowing you to specialise towards your preferred interests.\nThe       practical project\n (30 credits), completed in Semester 2, involves working with support from a science or health communication professional on developing and analysing an activity close toprofessional practice, or undertaking a creative project.\nFinally, you will write a dissertation (60 credits) over the summer (June-Sept). This is an original piece of research on a science or health communication topic based on your independent investigation. We encourage you to explore your individual interests in your dissertation and you will be assigned an academic supervisor to guide you in your research.\nThe course unit details given below are subject to change, and are the latest example of the curriculum available on this course of study.\nRead blogs from our MSc Science and Health Communication graduates to find out more about their experiences of studying the course.\nYou can read about:\nAmelia Doran's\n experience of how the different opportunities available on the course helped her decide her career focus.\nJoshua Muhumuza's\n reflection on studying MSc Science Health Communication and what he has been up to a year after graduating.\nAmie Peltzer's\n decision to study on the course and how the skills she has developed have helped her outside of academia.\nYou will have use of a shared office in the Centre for the History of Science, Technology and Medicine, including networked computer terminals and storage space, and use of a dedicated subject library housed in the PhD office.\nYou will also be able to access a range of       facilities\n throughout the University.\n• View tabs\n• View full page\n• Introduction to Science Communication (30 credits)\n• Communicating Ideas in Science, Technology and Medicine (15 credits)\n• Contexts for Science Communication, Past and Present (15 credits)\n• Science, Media and Journalism (15 credits)\n• Presenting Science in Public (15 credits)\n• Science, Government and Public Policy (15 credits)\n• Health Communication (15 credits)\n[HTML_TABLE]\nTitle | Code | Credit rating | Mandatory/optional\nContexts for Science Communication, Past and Present | HSTM60011 | 15 | Mandatory\nScience Communication Research Project | HSTM60022 | 60 | Mandatory\nIntroduction to Science Communication | HSTM60561 | 30 | Mandatory\nCommunicating ideas in STM | HSTM60571 | 15 | Mandatory\nScience Communication Practical Project | HSTM60622 | 30 | Mandatory\nHealth Communication | HSTM60032 | 15 | Optional\nPresenting Science in Public | HSTM60582 | 15 | Optional\nScience, Government & Public Policy | HSTM60592 | 15 | Optional\nScience, Media and Journalism | HSTM60602 | 15 | Optional\n[GRID_TABLE]\nAttend an open day\nDownload our course brochure",
