In most cases, you will have applied to Imperial well in advance of the start of the course, and our courses run over several years. It is not desirable and can be very difficult to fix all aspects of course delivery so far in advance.\nOne of the particular features of life at Imperial is that our courses are designed to be dynamic and responsive. We also encourage our academics to deliver courses in a manner which reflects their individual style and expertise, consistent with offering a world leading education.\nThis webpage details the limited circumstances in which we may need to make changes to or in relation to our courses, the type of changes we may make and how we will tell you about changes we have made.\nBelow we have set out the types of changes we may need to make to our courses, examples of those changes, and the reasons why we may need to make those changes.\nChanges which go to the heart of the educational experience you receive or which are significantly different to what you were told and what you would have expected when you accepted your place.\nFor legal or regulatory reasons, if there is a compelling academic need to make the change or because we otherwise think the change is necessary and in Imperial’s and/or your best interests.\nChanges which are part of the flexibility inherent to our courses, and which do not go to the heart of the educational experience you will receive; the course will not be significantly different from what you were told or what you would have expected.\nIn addition, to review and enhance the course as part of the College’s normal processes, to improve the services we offer or to operate efficiently.\nWe may need to make changes to our courses before you have accepted your place, after you have accepted your place, and once you have started studying on your course.\nHow we will communicate those changes to you and what course of action is open to you will depend on where you are in the application journey or whether you have already started your course of study.\nInformation in our prospectus and on our website is up to date when it is published, and is designed to be relevant to applicants who are then in the process of applying to study on the course.\nAs explained above, we may need to make certain changes to or in relation to our courses. If we do so, we will try to draw them to your attention, but we are not always aware who will have seen our prospectus or visited our website. As a result, we recommend you check the relevant course pages before finalising your application to ensure no changes have been made.\nIf we have to make any changes after you have been made an offer but before you start on the course, we will provide information on these within the relevant course pages.\nAs part of your preparations for starting at the College, you should regularly check the relevant course pages.\nIn the case of any major change, we will offer you the chance to withdraw from the course if you are unhappy about that change.\nIf you have any questions about changes that have been made to a course that you are holding an offer for, please contact the relevant department to discuss these changes and how they might affect your learning experience.\nIt is unlikely we will make major changes to your course once you have started studying however these types of changes are not always avoidable.\nExceptions include:\nWe will always do what we can to minimise any disruption or inconvenience to you.\nIn the event we have to make a major change, we will:\nIf you are unhappy with the major change, we will try to find a solution you are happy with and will support you, for example by offering you the right to withdraw without penalty, refunding your tuition fees, or allowing you to transfer to a different course.\nMinor changes will take place as part of the natural lifecycle of a course and many are inherent to the successful operation of the courses we offer. They are often unavoidable, for example, when a member of staff leaves. You are therefore expected to adopt a cooperative and flexible approach.\nYou will be told about minor changes which affect your course, but you will not be offered the right to withdraw, a refund, or the right to transfer to a different course as a result of a minor change.\n• Imperial Home\n• Study\n• Apply\n• Course changes\n• Course pages\n• Major changes\n• Minor changes\n• Changes to the course title\n• Changes to the award\n• Significant restructuring of the course\n• Substantial changes in course content\n• Changes to the progression rules\n• Changes to the status of a course (e.g. to accreditation status)\n• Fundamental changes to the learning and teaching strategy (e.g. changing the method of delivery from face-to-face to distance learning)\n• Changes to the primary campus location\n• Suspension or discontinuation of core modules\n• Discontinuation of elective modules\n• Suspension or discontinuation of the course\n• Change of lecturer or other staff\n• Changes to individual module titles\n• Revisions to the content of individual modules to reflect development within the academic discipline and current affairs\n• Changes to enhance the delivery or assessment methods of individual modules\n• Timetabling changes\n• Incidental changes to our facilities\n• Temporary suspension of elective modules\n• Changes after publication of course information, before you apply\n• Changes after you have been made an offer but before you start on the course\n• Major changes once you have started studying on your course\n• Minor changes once you have started studying on your course\n• where we are affected by an event outside of our control\n• where you resit or repeat a year so that you do not complete your studies as expected\n• where we are not able to teach-out the course as planned\n• consult you in advance\n• listen to your views\n• seek your agreement\n[CARD]\nWhat we consider to be a major change\nChanges which go to the heart of the educational experience you receive or which are significantly different to what you were told and what you would have expected when you accepted your place.\nWhy we may need to make major changes\nFor legal or regulatory reasons, if there is a compelling academic need to make the change or because we otherwise think the change is necessary and in Imperial’s and/or your best interests.\nExamples of major changes\n\nChanges to the course title\nChanges to the award\nSignificant restructuring of the course\nSubstantial changes in course content\nChanges to the progression rules\nChanges to the status of a course (e.g. to accreditation status)\nFundamental changes to the learning and teaching strategy (e.g. changing the method of delivery from face-to-face to distance learning)\nChanges to the primary campus location\nSuspension or discontinuation of core modules\nDiscontinuation of elective modules\nSuspension or discontinuation of the course\n[CARD]\nWhat we consider to be a minor change\nChanges which are part of the flexibility inherent to our courses, and which do not go to the heart of the educational experience you will receive; the course will not be significantly different from what you were told or what you would have expected.\nWhy we may need to make minor changes\nFor legal or regulatory reasons, if there is a compelling academic need to make the change or because we otherwise think the change is necessary and in Imperial’s and/or your best interests.\nIn addition, to review and enhance the course as part of the College’s normal processes, to improve the services we offer or to operate efficiently.\nExamples of minor changes\n\nChange of lecturer or other staff\nChanges to individual module titles\nRevisions to the content of individual modules to reflect development within the academic discipline and current affairs\nChanges to enhance the delivery or assessment methods of individual modules\nTimetabling changes\nIncidental changes to our facilities\nTemporary suspension of elective modules\n[CARD]\nInformation in our prospectus and on our website is up to date when it is published, and is designed to be relevant to applicants who are then in the process of applying to study on the course.\nAs explained above, we may need to make certain changes to or in relation to our courses.
