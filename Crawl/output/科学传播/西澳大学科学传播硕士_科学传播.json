This means that the tuition fee for this course will not be fully covered and there is a gap payment required beyond the HELP loan.

More information\nCould not find fee information for the selected course.\nI want to price my units\nCheck the Handbook to confirm the units you need to complete your course, major(s) and/or minor(s).

For study plan advice, please contact your Student Advising Office. Tuition fees are reviewed annually and are subject to change.\n1 EFTSL is the Equivalent Full Time Study Load. A standard full time enrolment of 48 points per year equals 1 EFTSL. If you enrol in more or less than 48 credit points per year, your yearly annual fee may be different.\nTuition fees are reviewed annually and are subject to increase, as outlined in the UWA Acceptance Contract.\nSelect Units\nPrint this page\nA Commonwealth supported place is a subsidised enrolment at university. The Australian Government subsidises a Commonwealth supported place by paying part of the fees for the place directly to the university and the student pays the remainder of the fees through a 'student contribution' amount.\nCommonwealth supported places are only available to domestic students. These places are available in all undergraduate courses at UWA and some postgraduate courses.\nTo be eligible for a Commonwealth supported place, you must:\nAustralian citizens and permanent humanitarian visa holders who are enrolled in a Commonwealth supported place can use the HECS-HELP scheme to help them pay their student contributions.\nNew Zealand citizens and permanent visa holders enrolled in a Commonwealth supported place must pay their student contribution upfront to UWA by the census date. If their student contribution amount is left unpaid after the census date then UWA will cancel a student's Commonwealth supported place.\nIf you are not enrolled as a Commonwealth supported student, you will be enrolled as a fee paying student. This means the Government does not subsidise your education and you will need to pay the tuition fees set by UWA. Some fee paying students are eligible for a FEE-HELP loan to pay their tuition fees.\nThe Government administers the Higher Education Loan Programme (HELP) which consists of five HELP loans schemes to assist students with the cost of their fees. The right loan for you will depend on your circumstances, eligibility and where you want to study. For further information please visit StudyAssist : HELP Loans.\nThe Australian Government sets limits on combined HELP loan amount – the cap on what you can borrow from the Australian Government to cover the costs of your tuition fees. Students eligible for HELP can only defer tuition fees up to their combined HELP limit. Students are responsible for managing their HELP usage and must pay upfront any tuition fees that exceed their available HELP balance. Refer to StudyAssist for further details regarding HELP.\nEquivalent full-time student load (EFTSL) is a measure of the study load for a year of a student undertaking a course on a full-time basis.\nThe EFTSL value assigned to each unit of study taken in a course represents the workload in the unit as a proportion of the standard annual workload normally undertaken by a full-time student in that course. These calculations are normally based on the credit point values for coursework degrees. Therefore, a 6 point unit taken in a course for which 48 points constitutes a standard annual workload would be assigned 6/48 = 0.125 EFTSL. The same unit taken in a degree with 50 points in a standard year would be assigned 6/50 = 0.12 EFTSL.\nNew HECS fees for psychology came into place from 2021.\nPsychology is within the Humanities broader discipline and are now HECS band 4 for the majority of students who commence in 2021 onwards.\nThe four courses listed below have been approved at this point in time as pathway programs for psychology, and therefore are eligible for the Australian Government Professional Pathway funding rates (HECS band 2). This means that Commonwealth Supported Place students in the accredited units in these specific courses will receive a discounted rate instead of the full rate displayed in this Fee Calculator.\nEvery non-exempt student enrolled in a Commonwealth supported unit of study must pay the student contribution amount for the unit.\nThis amount depends on the funding cluster to which units of study are allocated.\nUnits of study are allocated to funding clusters according to their discipline under the Australian Standard Classification of Education.\nThe maximum student contribution amounts for a particular year are published by the Department of Education.\nWhen calculating the student contribution amount for a unit, the formula is the student contribution amount for a place set by UWA for the unit multiplied by the EFTSL value of the unit.\nExample: Sandra has enrolled in MATH1001 as part of her Bachelor of Science degree. UWA has set the student contribution amount for a place at $3,985 (the maximum permitted) for that unit of study in 2022. The EFTSL value for MATH1001 is 0.125 EFTSL (6/48). Therefore, Sandra's student contribution amount for MATH1001 will be 3,985 X 0.125 = $498.125\nThe table below shows the student contribution amounts for a student place (EFTSL), by discipline, in 2022:\n1.

Professional Pathway Psychology units of study are Behavioural Science units (with FOE codes starting with 0907) that contribute to courses of study that lead to a bachelor's degree, honours degree or master's degree in psychology with a course structure that makes it compulsory to study the units relevant to professional registration as a psychologist by the Psychology Board of Australia, and which itself represents a pathway to professional registration as a psychologist.\n5.

Your annual course fees are payable as a lump sum but can be paid in two instalments on a semester basis. Unfortunately, a late fee will apply if tuition fees are not paid by the census date, so make sure you don’t leave it too late! We understand that circumstances may change, so international students can apply for a refund of fees provided that they meet certain conditions. You can find out more about refunds here.\n[HEADING] Overseas Student Health Cover (OSHC)\n[HEADING] The Department of Home Affairs requires all international students to have Overseas Student Health Cover (OSHC) for the whole duration of their student visa. This is an insurance to help you meet the costs of any medical care you will need when studying in Australia and will be required from the time you arrive. You may obtain OSHC from the provider of your choice but UWA’s preferred provider for all international students is Medibank. On acceptance and payment of your offer, UWA can arrange health cover with Medibank for the duration of your student visa if required.\n[HEADING] Student Services and Amenities Fee (SSAF)\n[HEADING] At UWA, a compulsory Student Services and Amenities Fee (SSAF) is payable for each year or part-year of your study. This fee is used to improve the quality and quantity of services to all students. An electronic SSAF Statement of Account notification fee will be sent to your UWA student email address each semester following your enrolment.\n[HEADING] Application Processing Fee\n[HEADING] International students applying directly to UWA and agents applying on behalf of students to study at UWA will need to pay a non-refundable fee of $150.

Here is all the important information you need to know about international student course fees when you choose to study with us at UWA.\nThe amount you will need to pay as an international student for tuition fees depends on the course of study and your enrolment. New students can refer to their Acceptance of Offer Contract and once enrolled, their Statement of Account for an indication of total tuition fees. Tuition fees are reviewed annually and are subject to increase, as outlined in the UWA Acceptance Contract, so please keep this in mind too.\nPlease see Fee Calculator for the annual course charges.\nInternational students will need to pay tuition fees unless sponsored or awarded a scholarship. Please see the Fee Calculator for the annual Higher Degree Research (HDR) course charges. However, you may also be eligible for assistance under the Commonwealth Government’s Research Training Program (RTP).\nInternational onshore students admitted to a HDR under the RTP are eligible for a RTP fees offset and/or stipend. A RTP fees offset pays for the tuition fees for the duration of the course, up to a maximum of four years full-time equivalent study for a doctorate by research and two years full-time equivalent study for a master's by research. A RTP stipend assists HDR students with their living costs while undertaking a HDR course. Stipend scholarships to support living expenses are available during the International Scholarship Round.
