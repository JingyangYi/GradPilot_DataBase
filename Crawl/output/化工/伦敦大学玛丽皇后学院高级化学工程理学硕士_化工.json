Research in the Gautrot lab focuses on the design of novel biomaterials and methodologies that allow the study of bio-interfaces and their control for applications in cell-based assays, bio-sensors and regenerative medicine. Our work in the field of biomaterials design is inspired by Nature's strategies to generate complexity and control function and properties. In particular, we are interested in novel synthetic tools and methodologies allowing the use of Nature's own building blocks, peptide sequences, to confer mechanical, chemical and biological properties to biomaterials. This approach, well suited for design, is appealing as it makes use of the inherent biological \"wiring\" that has evolved to control cell and tissue homeostasis: peptide sequences and proteins are the key components that shape biological tissues. In addition, we develop new micro- and nano-patterning techniques to recreate the geometric and hierarchical complexity encountered in cells and tissues (e.g. positioning of organelles, generation of cell polarity and mimicking of tissue architecture and morphogenesis). Key questions that these tools will allow us to address are: how do biological, mechanical and chemical properties of bio-materials (whether synthetic or of natural origin) cross-talk to control cell behaviour and in particular stem cell fate decision? How do cells remodel such materials and how does this impact on cell behaviour and tissue formation? Finally, what is the minimum set of rules or properties required to achieve a desired cell or tissue function?\n• Biography\n• Teaching\n• Research\n• Funding\n• Publications\n• News\n• Group Members",

When we make offers of admission, they are subject to the relevant terms and conditions.\nOur terms and conditions can be found here.\nAdmissions Policies and Procedures\nOur admissions policies and procedures can be found on our dedicated webpages.\nContract with Queen Mary University of London\nThe acceptance of your postgraduate offer marks the beginning of a contract between you and Queen Mary University of London.\nExtenuating circumstances during the admission process\nAt Queen Mary, we do not consider extenuating circumstances in assessing academic qualifications for entry onto our programmes. We appreciate there may be circumstances, outside an applicant’s control, that they feel may have impaired their assessment performance and ability to meet our minimum academic entry requirements and, in these instances, we advise applicants raise this with their previous school/institution or examination board so that they can factor it in when awarding grades.\nOur entry requirements clearly state the minimum academic grade applicants need to attain, as well as required or cognate subjects needed, where applicable. In circumstances where an applicant has not attained the minimum required grade for entry, due to extenuating circumstances, we will have expected applicants to have notified their school, university or examination board and outlined the circumstances that have impacted their learning. Where applicable, we would expect this to be considered in the final examinations or assessments and reflected in the final grades awarded. Queen Mary will therefore not further consider these circumstances as part of its decision making.\nEducation providers and examination bodies can provide reasonable adjustments for disabilities or long-term conditions (including specific learning differences and mental health diagnoses) that may affect students during their studies or examinations and we would expect that adequate and appropriate measures would have been put in place. Circumstances like this would not be considered as extenuating circumstances.\nQueen Mary’s mission is to create a truly inclusive environment where we support talented students regardless of their background or personal experience, please be aware that extenuating circumstances are separate to our Contextual Admissions criteria and guidance.\n• Queen Mary University of London\n• Postgraduate\n• Taught programmes\n• How to apply\n• Completed application form\n• Academic qualifications\n• If your degree was awarded by a UK university, please upload a transcript of your marks for each year or an electronic Higher Education Achievement Reports (HEAR).\n• If your degree was awarded by an overseas institution, you should supply a transcript of your marks for each year of your studies and a copy of your degree certificate together with a certified translation if the document is not in English.
