Bernoulli\n[HEADING] Follow us!\nHow can you make sustainable products from biomass? How can you\ndesign a catalyst to convert CO₂ into a useful polymer? How\ncan you design an efficient electrolyzer for producing green\nhydrogen? How can you recycle used car tyres into a waterproof\nrubber coating? How can you develop new polymers with tailored\nfunctionalities? These are some of the relevant questions you will\nbe able to answer once you have completed the Master degree\nprogramme in Chemical Engineering in Groningen.\nThe two-year programme offers a core programme and then the\nchoice between five specialisations: Advanced Process Technology,\nPolymeric Products, Bio-based Products and Processes, Industrial\nCatalysis and Renewable Energy. The unique feature of studying this\nMaster's programme at the University of Groningen is the\ncombination of a wide range of Chemical Engineering topics with a\nsolid background in Applied Chemistry and a focus on\nSustainability, which will allow you to become a modern chemical\nengineer that is well versed in both Product and Process\nTechnology.\nYour research project will take place in one of our research\ngroups in the field of Green Chemical Reaction Engineering and\nChemical Product Technology. The Green Chemical Reaction\nEngineering group investigates the development of highly\nintensified catalytic technology for biomass conversion to biofuels\nand biobased chemicals. The Chemical Product Technology group\nperforms research for the design of new or improved chemical\nproducts. Particular attention is devoted to the development of new\ncatalytic systems and of polymeric products for specific\napplications. These activities are generally framed in a\ncomprehensive sustainability context.\nThe two-year programme offers five chemical engineering\nspecializations:\nThe programme is split into a core programme (95 ECTS,\ncompulsory for every student), a sub programme of 15 ECTS, and 10\nECTS choice. In the core programme you will deal with themes such\nas catalysis, interfacial engineering, bio-based products, polymer\nproducts and advanced product engineering.\n\nFor the complete curriculum, please see:\nhttps://ocasys.rug.nl/current/catalog/programme/60437\nExchange: All our science and engineering programmes offer study\nabroad possibilities at a number of partner institutions. Our\npartners include top-100 universities in Europe (for example in\nItaly, Germany, UK, and Sweden) and in the USA, China, South-East\nAsia, and South America. Our exchange programmes have a typical\nduration of one semester and count toward your final degree.\nInternship: This programme offers you the opportunity to carry\nout an internship at a company in the Netherlands or abroad. Our\nchoice of industry partners ranges from large multinationals (such\nas Shell, Philips, Unilever) to dynamic small-medium enterprises in\nthe Groningen area. The internship has a typical duration of 3 to 4\nmonths and counts towards your final degree.\nBachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering.

In the Netherlands, you will\nalso be entitled to use the ir. (ingenieur) title.\nChemical engineers from the University of Groningen are known\nfor their flexibility and all-round skills. As a graduate, you can\nchoose a to have a career in a company like for example DSM, Nobian\nor Philips.\nVarious other companies, locally, nationally and\ninternationally, are also keen to recruit chemical engineers from\nGroningen. Job possibilities in the region are expanding rapidly.\nGroningen is developing new industry and there is a high demand for\nwell-trained new staff. You can also decide to develop your\nknowledge further by doing a PhD at a University.\nThe Master's\nprogramme in Chemical Engineering includes a significant amount of\nresearch as part of its curriculum.\n\nThe\nEngineering and Technology Institute Groningen\n\n(ENTEG) is the primary\nresearch institute the programme is connected to, and is composed\nof various research groups that cover a wide range of\nsubjects:\nResearch groups\n\nGreen Chemical Reaction\nEngineering\n\n(GCRE) and\n\nProduct Technology\n\n(PT) are most relevant\nto chemical engineers. More information about research topics of\nthese specific research groups can be found for\n\nGCRE\n\nand\n\nPT\n\n.\nI have already almost finished the first year of my Master's\ndegree programme, and I hope I've passed all my exams! I am\nfollowing the Catalysis track.\nAfter the summer, I will continue by conducting a study. This\nstudy will revolve around how to extract aviation fuel from CO2 and\ncarbon monoxide using a catalyst, and above all, how this can be\ndone more efficiently and on a larger scale. My Bachelor’s\nresearch was on a similar topic, and I asked my supervisor whether\nI could be involved in another research study in this area.\nI wanted to stay in Groningen upon obtaining my Bachelor’s\ndegree. The degree programme suits me well and I have a lot of\nfriends here. What I find remarkable about this degree programme is\nthe relationship between lecturers and students. It is surprisingly\nenjoyable; the lecturers are very approachable. You can easily ask\nthem questions or perhaps even ask them whether they know of any\ninteresting student assistant jobs.\nI also value that the degree programme is continuously working\non improvement, that there are annual feedback sessions, and that\nthey actually want to know what students think of it. I\ncouldn’t attend the feedback session this year, and the\nlecturer made a separate appointment with me to hear my\nthoughts.\n• Sign\nup for our Master's Week\n• Subscribe to our monthly\nnewsletter\n• Chemical Engineers from Groningen are known for their\nflexibility and all-round skills\n• The Chemistry field in Groningen has the CHE Excellence\nLabel\n• In the Netherlands, you will be entitled to use the title of ir\n(ingenieur)\n• A lot of graduates make a career at major companies\n• Regularly ranked as one of the Best Chemical Engineering\nMaster's degree programmes in the Netherlands according to\nElsevier\n• Advanced Process Technology\n• Polymeric Products\n• Bio-based Products and Processes\n• Industrial Catalysis\n• Renewable Energy\n• Study abroad is recommended\n• For an average of 20 weeks\n• Maximum of  60 EC\n• assessment interview\n• Work for multinationals like Philips, Nouryon, DSM and Sabic\n• Work for a small or medium company in the region\n• PhD research position\n• Work for consulting and engineering firms\n• Supercritical\nCO₂ as a green solvent for industrial purposes\n• Electrocatalysis to\nrenewable hydrogen for the circular economy\n• Conversion of waste\nproducts (CO2, plastics) and biomass into valuable products and\nfuels\n• Development of\nindustrial catalysts\n• Design of\nindustrial processes\n• Developing new\nprintable polymers for eco-friendly 3D printing\n• The development and\nscaling of highly efficient microreactors to an industrial\nscale\n• Academic Advisors FSE (For questions regarding the programme)\n• studyscience@rug.nl Study Science (For students who are interested in a Campus Tour or who have other general questions)Email: studyscience rug.nl\n• facebook.com/sciencestudentsuniversityofgroningen\n• instagram.com/scienceandengineering_ug\n[HTML_TABLE]\nProgramme options\nAdvanced Process Technology (specialization)\nPolymeric Products (specialization)\nBio-based Products and Processes (specialization)\nIndustrial Catalysts (specialization)\nRenewable Energy (specialization)\n[HTML_TABLE]\nSpecific requirements | More information\nprevious education | Bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering.
