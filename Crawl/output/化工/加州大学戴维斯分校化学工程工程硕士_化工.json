Bull will receive a stipend and mentoring from researchers at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico while conducting research both at the national laboratory and at UC Davis in professor Tonya Kuhl’s laboratory.\nA new study from UC Davis found that the louder people talk, the more airborne particles they emit, making loudness a potential factor in spreading airborne diseases. The study, led by chemical engineering Ph.D. student Sima Asadi in professor William Ristenpart’s group, looked at particle emission during speech as a function of loudness, among other factors.\n• by  Noah Pflueger-Peters\n• June 24, 2022\n• Students\n• by  Noah Pflueger-Peters\n• March 09, 2022\n• Students\n• Awards & Recognition\n• June 24, 2021\n• Students\n• June 01, 2021\n• Students\n• March 17, 2021\n• Students\n• by  Noah Pflueger-Peters\n• December 30, 2019\n• Students\n• by  Noah Pflueger-Peters\n• December 20, 2019\n• Research\n• August 22, 2019\n• Students\n• August 08, 2019\n• Students\n• August 06, 2019\n• Students",
