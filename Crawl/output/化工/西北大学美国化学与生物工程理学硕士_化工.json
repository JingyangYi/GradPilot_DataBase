The deadline to apply is December 15th, 2024.\nThe department only admits MS-seeking graduate students for Fall quarter.\nApplications for admission to the MS program in Fall 2025 are now open. The deadline to apply is July 21, 2025.\nPlease see the frequently asked questions about how to apply below, as well as additional information on the main McCormick School website.\nJump to a Section\nIf you’re interested in applying to either the master of science or PhD program in chemical and biological engineering, please submit your application through The Graduate School.\nApplications for admission to the PhD and MS programs for the 2025-2026 academic school year will open in early September.\nStart the MS or PhD application\nIf you’re interested in applying to the master of science in biotechnology program, please do so through the program’s website.\nStart the MBP program application\nYes, all students have to pay the application fee. The application fee is not typically waived. The Graduate School at Northwestern (TGS) provides fee waivers on a first-come, first serve basis to eligible applicants who meet certain criteria. If you meet the criteria you will automatically be given a waiver upon application.\nThe fee must be paid online using a credit card. If you do not have a credit card and are unable to borrow a card from a friend or family member, please contact The Graduate School’s admissions staff. Students without credit cards may also pay using a Visa gift card, which may be purchased in a number of ways and is a gift certificate that may be used in place of a credit card. These gift cards frequently involve a nominal purchase fee, though, and the use of a standard credit card is recommended if at all possible.\nYes, you can find a list of resources and advice for essay writing here.\nNote: This document is intended to help applicants best communicate aspects of their experiences and desires that are pertinent to the PhD admissions committee.  Following these guidelines should not be perceived as a guarantee of admission into our program in any way.\nYou can find The Graduate School's official essay guidelines here.\nReturn to Top\nFor more information on how Letters of Recommendation are handled, please see The Graduate School's policies on LORs.\nIt is not how many you send, but the information contained in those letters that contributes to your overall admissibility. Send the required number (no more than three), but choose your recommenders well.\nReturn to Top\nOur program will not be accepting GRE scores for the 2024-2025 application cycle.\nPlease do not submit GRE scores; they will not be accepted for the 2024-2025 admissions cycle.\nThe TOEFL minimum requirement is 100 for PhD and 90 for MS applicants.\nWe also accept IELTS scores in lieu of TOEFL scores. The requirement is 7.5 for PhD and 7.0 for MS applicants.\nApplicants with a degree from an English speaking institution will have their TOEFL/IELTS requirement waived upon review of their application.\nThe supporting documentation for TOEFL scores has some flexibility. Once you know your scores upon completion of the test, you can self-report these scores on the application. You must then request that a score report is sent to Northwestern University. Note, however, that it is your responsibility to make sure that the department receives this documentation. It is important to get these score reports in to the department as soon as possible.\nOur policy is to provide final decision offers after all applications have been reviewed.\nA degree from an English speaking institution will waive the TOEFL/IELTS. This will happen manually after you submit your application, so please don’t be alarmed if the system is saying that the score is missing. Once your application is submitted, an administrator will review all materials and waive the requirement manually.\nReturn to Top\nYou need to fill out a new online application and pay the application fee again. However, you may not need to send new copies of the supporting documents if we still have them on file.\nIf you receive any notable commendations after submission of your application, please send an email to the graduate program assistant with the relevant information and a request for it to be incorporated into your file.\nIf you have degrees in other engineering disciplines, chemistry, physics, or applied math, you can apply for the chemical and biological engineering program. In most cases, it may be necessary to first take some undergraduate chemical engineering courses to be prepared for the core chemical engineering graduate courses.If you have a biological science degree and have interest in working with the synthetic biology faculty, please apply to the Interdisciplinary Biological Sciences Program (IBiS).The graduate course requirements in IBiS are better suited for your degree and background, and synthetic biology faculty also take students from IBiS.\nYes. The large majority of the graduate students we admit received their BS degrees from US institutions, but we do admit a small pool of international students each year.\nThe supplemental portion of the application is not required. This is just a section for you to include anything else that does not necessarily fit into another category.\nReturn to Top\nEarly in the fall, each faculty member who is looking to recruit new students will give a research presentation at the beginning of the fall semester. Over the next four weeks or so, you will talk in more detail with the faculty members with whom you have interest in working. In November, you submit your top three adviser choices, in rank order. The faculty members then meet to match students’ and advisers’ preferences.\nTypically, the matching process has gone very well, with the majority of the students receiving their top choice. In some cases, a student’s second or third choice is awarded. It is extremely rare that we are not able to satisfy one of the top three choices. In this case, we work with the student to identify other available advisors that are still in their area of interest.\nReturn to Top\nThe typical residency for a PhD student is five years.\nPhD students are required to take 10 classes on the quarter system. MS students take 7 or 10 courses, depending on whether they opt for the thesis or course based option, respectively.\nWe do not have formal qualifying exams. After the first year, PhD students wishing to be considered for continuation are evaluated based on their coursework and research performance to date. Students are asked to demonstrate a minimum 3.5 GPA in graduate coursework and to demonstrate a working knowledge of their selected field of research.\nReturn to Top\nWhile there are some limited funding opportunities for full-time masters students in our department, preference is given to the doctoral students. As a consequence, nearly all of our master’s students are self-funded.\nIn our department, fulltime PhD students are provided funding for living expenses, benefits, and full tuition for at least five years, as long as progress milestones are being met. Students in the PhD program are offered a competitive annual stipend. For the 2024-2025 academic year, the base stipend is $36,960. Students are highly encouraged to seek their own outside funding, as this can increase their stipend and can be quite prestigious.\nNorthwestern University does not make decisions related to admissions, including but not limited to financial aid and scholarships, based upon any category protected by the law. The University is committed to complying with all applicable laws. The University believes different perspectives, experiences, and backgrounds are critical to building a dynamic student body, and as such encourages all qualified applicants to apply.\nJennifer Cole Assistant Chair and Lecturer Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering Phone: 847-467-5712 Email Jennifer\nGraduate Program Assistant Phone: 847-491-2773 Send email\n• Application Process\n• Recommendations\n• Test Score Requirements\n• Admissions Prerequisites\n• Research and Advisers\n• Program Specifics\n• Funding\n• Graduate Study\n• Chemical & Biological Engineering (MS)\n• Chemical & Biological Engineering (PhD)\n• Master of Science in Biotechnology\n• Engineering Home\n• ChBE Department\n• Academics\n• Graduate Study\n• Admissions\n• The Graduate School\n• Graduate Funding\n• International Office\n• Graduate Housing\n• Meet Our Faculty\n• Our Whole-Brain Engineering Philosophy",

For more information about the PhD in chemical and biological engineering, download the following PDF:\nPhD in chemical and biological engineering handbook\nOur department’s course requirements for the PhD degree are:\nFour core, graduate-level chemical engineering courses.\nCHEM ENG 401 Mathematical Methods for Chemical Engineering (typically Fall)CHEM ENG 420 Transport (typically Winter)CHEM ENG 408 Chemical Engineering Kinetics and Reactor Design (typically Spring)CHEM ENG 404 Advanced Thermodynamics (typically Fall)Two electives within the department, among those listed as a TGS course with the registrar.\nTwo out-of-department technical electives, among those listed as a TGS course with the registrar.\nTwo other technical electives, either within or outside the department, among those listed as a TGS course with the registrar.\nAt least two must be non-departmental electives: Choose from 300- or 400-level courses in other science and engineering departments. Note that most 300-level courses required for the BS degree at Northwestern in other science and engineering departments cannot be taken for credit toward a graduate degree. CHEM ENG 341 Process Dynamics and Control is the only exception, if this course does not duplicate a course taken for a previous degree.\nIf students have not taken undergraduate courses in fluid mechanics, heat/mass transfer, and reactor engineering, they will be required to take the Northwestern courses before they take the graduate-level equivalent. Other courses may also be recommended. Alternately, students may take and pass (B or better) a comprehensive exam prior to the start of the relevant graduate course. Note that these additional courses will be graded, but they will not contribute toward other graduate degree course requirements, including the calculation of the 3.5 GPA required by the department. Note also that the formal continuation decision for these students may be delayed by one or more quarters, but it will not typically change other milestone dates for the student.

It felt like I was truly a member of the team.”\n“\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIt [co-op] exposed me to two different sides of my major and narrowed down what I want to do in my future career. I was able to experience both the research side of my major, biomedical engineering, and also the research and development for medical devices. I got to see two different doors. Essentially, that helped me narrow down what I want to do in the future.”\n“\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI built a lot of connections in the industry. It’s a lot easier to do that once you’re inside than from the outside. Having almost a year of experience comes in handy. You really build more meaningful connections in a co-op experience because they are really invested in watching you grow.”\n“\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBeing in a data analyst co-op helped me see what the role actually means and how to be responsible.

Also, I connected with very amazing coworkers and supervisors.”\n“\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCo-ops presented a really interesting option as I started to look at internships, because you stay at a company longer.
