It should be emphasized that merely passing all graduate courses does not obligate the University to grant a degree. Successful candidates for the MSE degree must be recommended as such by the Graduate Group Committee.\n\nUpon Completion\nWhen you complete the requirements and are ready to graduate, you must complete the Application for Graduation and submit the form to the Academic Programs Office in 109 Towne building.\nIn This Section:\n\n\n\nAdmissions\nFellowships + Financial Aid\nCBE Electives Courses List\nTransfer Credits\nFellowships & Financial Aid\nAdvanced Materials & Nanotechnology\nBiotechnology & Pharmaceuticals\nComputational Sciences & Machine Learning\nEnergy, Sustainability, & Environment\nInnovation & Entrepreneurship\nProcess Control & Design\nSoft Matter & Complex Fluids\n\nYour CBE Contact:\nAshley Culver – Graduate Program Coordinator\nOffice:  311A Towne Building\nPhone: 215-898-8352\nEmail: ashleycr@seas.upenn.edu\nHelpful Links:\n\nAdmissions\nDegree Requirements\nFellowships + Support\nTransfer Credits\nCBE Electives Course List\nGraduate Group\nInternational Students\nVeterans and Active Military\nGraduate Student Resources\nChEGA\nGeneral Student Resources\nForms for Graduate Students\nIn This Section:\n\n\n\nAdmissions\nFellowships + Financial Aid\nCBE Electives Courses List\nTransfer Credits\nFellowships & Financial Aid\nAdvanced Materials & Nanotechnology\nBiotechnology & Pharmaceuticals\nComputational Sciences & Machine Learning\nEnergy, Sustainability, & Environment\nInnovation & Entrepreneurship\nProcess Control & Design\nSoft Matter & Complex Fluids\n\nYour CBE Contact:\nAshley Culver – Graduate Program Coordinator\nOffice:  311A Towne Building\nPhone: 215-898-8352\nEmail: ashleycr@seas.upenn.edu\nHelpful Links:\n\nAdmissions\nDegree Requirements\nFellowships + Support\nTransfer Credits\nCBE Electives Course List\nGraduate Group\nInternational Students\nVeterans and Active Military\nGraduate Student Resources\nChEGA\nGeneral Student Resources\nForms for Graduate Students\nAdmissions\nFellowships + Financial Aid\nCBE Electives Courses List\nTransfer Credits\nFellowships & Financial Aid\nAdvanced Materials & Nanotechnology\nBiotechnology & Pharmaceuticals\nComputational Sciences & Machine Learning\nEnergy, Sustainability, & Environment\nInnovation & Entrepreneurship\nProcess Control & Design\nSoft Matter & Complex Fluids\n[GRID_TABLE]\nIn This Section:\n\n\n\nAdmissions\nFellowships + Financial Aid\nCBE Electives Courses List\nTransfer Credits\nFellowships & Financial Aid\nAdvanced Materials & Nanotechnology\nBiotechnology & Pharmaceuticals\nComputational Sciences & Machine Learning\nEnergy, Sustainability, & Environment\nInnovation & Entrepreneurship\nProcess Control & Design\nSoft Matter & Complex Fluids\n\nYour CBE Contact:\nAshley Culver – Graduate Program Coordinator\nOffice:  311A Towne Building\nPhone: 215-898-8352\nEmail: ashleycr@seas.upenn.edu\nHelpful Links:\n\nAdmissions\nDegree Requirements\nFellowships + Support\nTransfer Credits\nCBE Electives Course List\nGraduate Group\nInternational Students\nVeterans and Active Military\nGraduate Student Resources\nChEGA\nGeneral Student Resources\nForms for Graduate Students\nAdmissions\nFellowships + Financial Aid\nCBE Electives Courses List\nTransfer Credits\nFellowships & Financial Aid\nAdvanced Materials & Nanotechnology\nBiotechnology & Pharmaceuticals\nComputational Sciences & Machine Learning\nEnergy, Sustainability, & Environment\nInnovation & Entrepreneurship\nProcess Control & Design\nSoft Matter & Complex Fluids\n[GRID_TABLE]\nAdmissions\nFellowships + Financial Aid\nCBE Electives Courses List\nTransfer Credits\nFellowships & Financial Aid\nAdvanced Materials & Nanotechnology\nBiotechnology & Pharmaceuticals\nComputational Sciences & Machine Learning\nEnergy, Sustainability, & Environment\nInnovation & Entrepreneurship\nProcess Control & Design\nSoft Matter & Complex Fluids",
