Applicants are expected to hold baccalaureate degrees from accredited colleges or universities prior to registration as graduate students. Three-year Bologna bachelor’s degree recipients are eligible for admission.  Applicants with three-year baccalaureate degrees from countries that are not part of the Bologna Process may also be considered for admission, on a case-by-case basis, using a holistic review.  \nApplicants for a master’s or doctoral degree program should have achieved a 3.0 (or equivalent) grade point index or higher from the institution where a baccalaureate degree or higher was awarded to be admitted without conditions of continued enrollment.  Some graduate programs have requirements for admission that exceed the general Office of the Vice Provost for Graduate Students and Postdoctoral Scholars requirements.\nRequirements and application deadlines vary by program. If you have questions about application deadlines or required materials, please contact your program of interest directly, using the phone or email address listed in the requirements pages below.\nSelect a campus\nChoose a location below to see the admissions requirements for each graduate program offered by your chosen campus.\n\n Purdue West Lafayette\n Purdue Fort Wayne\n Purdue Northwest\n\n\nSee the Graduate Degree Programs page for a complete listing of West Lafayette campus degree options and statistics, including enrollment figures, finances, average time to degree, job outcomes, and more.
