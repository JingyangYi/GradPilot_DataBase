The first semester takes place at EPFL; the second semester at ETH Zurich; the third semester includes core subjects offered at PSI and Industrial-Internship; the fourth semester comprises the Master's thesis.\nNuclear technology, particularly the generation of energy via nuclear fission, is a high-tech sector which involves extremely high levels of refinement of the raw material natural uranium. The entire energy generation chain is very complex, not least because of the comprehensive safety technology and safety culture it entails.\nIt primarily deals with the process and technology of energy conversion in the nuclear power plant, including the associated processes of the fuel cycle from the generation of fuel to disposal.\nIn addition, subjects are offered for the energetic use of nuclear fusion and for non-energetic applications of radiation in medicine and industry. Furthermore, the potential role of nuclear energy in a future sustainable energy supply is conveyed.\n120 ECTS | 2 years\nMaster of Science in Nuclear Engineering ETH Zurich – EPF Lausanne\nBachelor's degree:\nDownload MSc in Nuclear Engineering (PDF, 196 KB)\nMaster’s degree programme in Nuclear Engineering\nETH Zurich\n                    Department of Mechanical and Process Engineering\n                    Leonhardstrasse 21\n                LEE K 208\n                8092 \n                Zurich\n            Switzerland\n• Homepage\n• Navigation\n• Search\n• Content\n• Footer\n• Contact\n• Sitemap\n• Chemical Engineering\n• Chemistry\n• Electrical Engineering and Information Technology\n• Materials Science\n• Mathematics\n• Mechanical Engineering\n• Microtechnology\n• Physics\n• Phone\n                        +41 44 632 24 57\n[CARD]\nContact\nMaddalena Velonà\n\n\n\nPhone\n                        +41 44 632 24 57\n\n\n\n\n\n            ETH Zurich\n                    Department of Mechanical and Process Engineering\n                    Leonhardstrasse 21\n                LEE K 208\n                8092 \n                Zurich\n            Switzerland\n\n\n\n\n\n              Show more\n\n              Show less\n[CARD]\nContact\n[CARD]\nMaddalena Velonà\n\n\n\nPhone\n                        +41 44 632 24 57\n\n\n\n\n\n            ETH Zurich\n                    Department of Mechanical and Process Engineering\n                    Leonhardstrasse 21\n                LEE K 208\n                8092 \n                Zurich\n            Switzerland\n\n\n\n\n\n              Show more\n\n              Show less\n[CARD]\nMaddalena Velonà\n[CARD]\nPhone\n                        +41 44 632 24 57\n[CARD]\nETH Zurich\n                    Department of Mechanical and Process Engineering\n                    Leonhardstrasse 21\n                LEE K 208\n                8092 \n                Zurich\n            Switzerland\n[CARD]\nShow more\n\n              Show less",
