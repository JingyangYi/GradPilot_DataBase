This means you get to discuss the very latest ideas, research discoveries and new technologies, becoming actively involved in a research project yourself.\nYou’ll also benefit from our strong links with industry and excellent relationships with companies from across the globe, such as Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton, First Quantum, Glencore and many more.\nTo boost your employability and practical skills, we offer an extensive range of fieldwork opportunities where you can visit a variety of mining sites throughout your studies.\nThe best part about this course is how diverse and practical it is. The facilities are world-class and you get to learn from the reputable professors who have written most of the text books we learn from and are teaching us things they are currently researching. The support from my lecturers has been great, they have an open-door policy which means we can always pop in and ask them anything we need to.\nI have worked in many places around the world and have yet to visit a country where I could not find at least one CSM graduate. In fact, there are normally several and they can often be found in influential positions.\nStudying in Cornwall has been really good. The facilities are great, there are several different types of labs, a lot of space for learning and loads of learning resources.\nThe lecturers are always really helpful, supportive and there when you need them. The MSc Mining Geology programme has been really good as it covers all the aspects of all the different types of Geology. I’ve been able to learn a broad range of skills and the field trips have been great.\nScholarships available\nThe CSM Trust is delighted to offer six £5,000 scholarships for exceptional students enrolling in 2024 on a mining or geology related course.\nThe scholarships will be awarded at the panel’s discretion to the applicants considered most deserving of the award. The successful candidates will be expected to take part in activities to promote studying mining or geology at the University of Exeter. Find out more.\nTwo scholarships worth £26,500 each are available to students who have had an application accepted to one of the Camborne School of Mines MSc programmes for September 2024 entry. This scholarship programme is funded by a generous donation from London Metal Exchange (LME). As part of the scholarships the successful candidates will have the opportunity to undertake mentoring with LME staff and to work with LME on their dissertation project. Find out more.\nThese scholarships will enable up to two talented UK students studying on the MSc Exploration Geology programme to become distinguished Richard Osman Scholars. The successful candidates will receive a bursary covering their tuition fees in full, and a generous stipend of £12,000 toward living costs.\nFind out more about this scholarship.\nConnect with

This will then inform the decision as to whether a fee status assessment should be conducted.\nWhat happens if I think my fee status is incorrect?\nIf you have received an offer and you think your fee status is incorrect you have 28 days, from the date of your offer, to query your status. To query your fee status within the 28 day period please contact us at ad-feestatus@exeter.ac.uk stating your full name, Exeter student number, programme for which you have been made an offer and providing details of why you think the fee classification is incorrect.\nCan I request an appeal?\nIf you have queried your fee status within 28 days of receiving your offer and disagree with the outcome, you may request an appeal.

If you are classified as an international student but your situation changes before you have received a decision on your application or after receiving an offer we will conduct a fee reassessment. You will need to submit your new information before 1 September in the year the programme starts, e.g. evidence of British Citizenship or Indefinite Leave to Remain being granted.\nCan my fee status change after the course has started?\nThere are some circumstances where fee status can change in subsequent years, however this is very unusual.\nIf you think you have become entitled to ‘Home’ fees in time for the next year of your course please contact us at ad-feestatus@exeter.ac.uk giving full details of your updated status.\nThe full eligibility criteria can be found on the UK Council for International Student Affairs (UKCISA) website.\nInformation for Channel Islands/Isle of Man students\nFrom the 2021/22 academic year, new and continuing students living in the Crown Dependencies (the ‘Islands’), who come to England solely for the purposes of higher or further education study, will be eligible for home fee status, on the basis of 3 years’ residency in the UK or the Islands. The UK Government confirmed this eligibility in December 2020. For information on support available to you for tuition fees and living costs you should contact your island education offices.\nPlease visit our Student Finance webpage for Channel Islands students for more information.\nIn addition to tuition fees and living costs, your programme of study may have other costs associated with it, such as laboratory equipment or field trips.\nVisit our scholarships and funding website >>\nWhat if my programme lasts more than one year?\nIf the duration of your chosen programme of study spans more than one academic year, the tuition fees for future years are expected to rise by a modest amount to take account of inflationary pressures. You can view tuition fees for students already studying with us on our Student Finance web pages.\nWhen are my fees due?\nIf you receive an offer of a place on a full-time taught postgraduate programme you will need to pay a tuition fee deposit to confirm your place.\nTuition fees are typically payable in two 50% instalments, normally in September (at the start of your course) and January each year. See our student finance pages for more details.\nHow much will it cost?\nWhen you're studying for a Masters your tuition fee is only one part of the cost of doing a postgraduate degree: you also have to consider accommodation and living costs.\nAccommodation costs will vary depending on whether you live in private or University-owned accommodation. More details regarding accommodation, including costs, are available on our accommodation page.\nThe National Union of Students estimates student living costs, including accommodation, to be approximately £12,000 per year outside London.\nLiving costs are, to some extent, up to you.

Before you start:\n\ncheck the entry requirements on the website and research the course content thoroughly.\nthink about how undergraduate study has prepared you for a postgraduate course – perhaps through independent work, work placements or conferences that you've attended.\nthink about why this is the right course for you.\n\nTip 2: Tailor it to the course\nNo-one wants to read a statement that feels like it’s a copied from a template so make sure you tailor your statement to the course.\nOur admissions tutors will be looking for:\n\nan explanation of how the course links your past and future\nan insight into your abilities, and how they'll fit with the course – think about skills like research, critical thinking, communication, organisation, planning and time-management\nevidence of your skills, commitment and enthusiasm\nreasons why you want to study this course at the University of Exeter\nyour particular interest in the subject, perhaps including some academic references.\n\nTip 3: Keep it simple\nGetting your points across clearly is much easier when you don’t overcomplicate things. The following tips should help:\n\nStick to under 500 words in length\nKeep your sentences short and clear\nConsider using headings to break up the content - for example, 'Why the University of Exeter?' 'Why this course?' 'Career plans’\nProofread and ask a friend to check it over\nAvoid clichés like the plague\n\n\nCheck your grammar, punctuation and spelling for accuracy\nUse a standard font such as Arial or Times New Roman, text size 11\n\nTip 4: Show your enthusiasm\nTell us what you love about your subject and the programme you’re applying for – we want to know why you’re the perfect candidate for the course. Make sure you cover:\n\nwhy you want to study this Masters\nhow the course fits your attitude/skills/experience\nwhat you’re aiming to do in your future career\n\nIf you're applying for a subject in a different field from your undergraduate degree, tell us why you’ve decided to change direction.\nTip 5: Give it some structure\nUse a tight structure and make sure each paragraph flows logically. You should:\n\nhave a strong introduction that acts as a framework for the rest of your statement\nuse the main part of your statement to explain your interests, experience and knowledge and why you want to do this course\nuse your conclusion to clearly show your will to study and summarise why you're the ideal candidate.\n\nWhen you’re happy with it, submit your application online.
