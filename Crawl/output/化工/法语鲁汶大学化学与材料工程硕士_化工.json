It is entirely in English and starts with a year of general training either at the National Polytechnic Institute of Grenoble (France) or at the University of Augsburg (Germany); in the second year, students specialise in a field of materials sciences at one of 7 partner universities. UCLouvain offers a specialisation in materials and nano-structures engineering. Upon completing the programme, students are granted a dual Master’s degree.
