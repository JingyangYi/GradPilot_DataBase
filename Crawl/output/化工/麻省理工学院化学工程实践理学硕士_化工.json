      "content": "[HEADING] Admissions process\n[HEADING] MIT Graduate Admissions is a decentralized network that extends across all six academic schools and a total of 47 departments, labs, or centers that offer graduate degree programs.\n[HEADING] Helpful terms\n[HEADING] General information\n[HEADING] Starting the graduate application process\n[HEADING] Starting the Sloan application process\n[HEADING] Timeline\n[HEADING] Application timeline\n[HEADING] Department decision timeline\n[HEADING] Applicant reply to offer timeline\n[HEADING] Admissions offers with funding:\n[HEADING] Admissions offers without funding:\n[HEADING] Useful links\nBelow are some terms you will encounter when applying to MIT. To better understand the admissions process, please refer to this guide when necessary.\nThe MIT application process is divided into two application platforms. Most of our graduate departments use an unified application portal to host their master’s and doctoral programs offered, which you can find at apply.mit.edu/apply.\nThe Sloan School of Management uses a separate application portal, which you can find at applymitsloan.mit.edu/apply. The appropriate application portal is linked on each department’s webpage in the program directory.\nAll degree programs have a unique online application with a specific set of requirements and deadlines.\nAnswers to most common questions can be found online in the Frequently Asked Questions section. Specific questions related to department requirements, the review process, or test score requirements should be sent to the program to which you are applying.\nPlease send any general questions not addressed on our website to gradadmissions@mit.edu.\nTo apply to a graduate degree program, you can visit the application website, create an application login, and select your preferred department and degree program from the list of programs. By completing this initial step, you will create your application portal, which will host the graduate application(s) you start. You will be able to access degree program applications via your application portal, should you decide to apply to multiple programs.\nFor returning applicants, you can login to your application portal with your previous login credentials and start a new application.\nAll applicants must agree to the legal considerations implemented by the Institute. You will be required to confirm your adherence to these legal considerations and sign an attestation in order to submit your application(s). You will also be required to follow the application instructions provided by the department(s) to which you are applying.\nFor Sloan programs, you can visit the Sloan application website and fill out a contact form to Sloan.\nAlternatively, you can select the information page of your Sloan degree program of interest, and click the “Apply Here” link.\nApplication timelines are determined by each department. No two departments at MIT are exactly alike; as such, there is no single application deadline or review period that fits all departments. However, there are general timeframes that most departments follow, with the exception of departments that use rolling admissions rounds for their degree programs, such as programs related to business and management.\nEach department has their own timeline for releasing application decisions. Typically, initial decisions and waitlist decisions are sent around the middle of the Spring semester. Please note: If you do not receive a decision at this point in your review period, your application is still being considered for admission.\nAll applications are considered under review until which time an official admission decision is released. Applicants will be notified via email of a change to their decision status and will be prompted to login to their portal to view their official decision.\nPlease note: MIT is a participating institution in the Council of Graduate Schools (CGS), and we adhere to the April 15 Resolution. April 15 is a deadline utilized by all departments that offer financial support to their admitted students. CGS defines April 15 as the date to which all participating institutions must honor their offers of funding.\nIf you are offered admission to the Institute and you receive an offer of funding from MIT*, your offer will be valid until at least April 15. After this date, departments have the right to alter or rescind their funding offer. Some departments may extend this deadline past April 15 with the same funding offer. To find out more information about a department’s decision timeline, please reach out to the department(s) to which you applied.\n*Funding from MIT includes any fully-funded or partially-funded offers. These are usually granted by RAships and Fellowships in your offer of admission.\nPlease be advised that if you accept an offer of admission with funding from MIT prior to April 15, and you wish to withdraw your acceptance, you must reach out directly to the department to which you were admitted and let them know of your change in status.\nIn accordance with our legal considerations to which all applicants must attest, you may not accept an offer of admission elsewhere if you have already accepted admission from MIT.\nIf you are offered admission to the Institute but you do not receive funding from MIT, you are entitled to hold your offer of admission until you are ready to accept or decline your offer. You are also entitled to withdraw your acceptance of our offer at any time. This includes applicants who will receive full funding for their degree from the U.S. military, a private company, or who are self-funded.\nThis site uses cookies to give you the best possible experience.

Here are master’s-level degree types we offer:\nMost of our master’s degrees at MIT require at least one academic year of study. Some of our departments require all incoming PhD students to enter as master’s-level students before moving on to the higher degree path. However, admission to an MIT master’s degree program does not necessarily imply an automatic commitment by MIT beyond that level of study.\nTo graduate from a master’s program at MIT, a student must have a clear record in an approved program of graduate study and research and their academic standing, as shown by the cumulative grade point record, must be of distinctly high grade. Program or Departmental Graduate committees can specify subject substitutions to be counted in the graduate program for the purpose of satisfying the graduate subject unit requirement at their discretion.\nBelow is a list of programs and departments that offer master-level degrees.\nThis site uses cookies to give you the best possible experience.

      "content": "[HEADING] Costs & funding\n[HEADING] Many academic departments provide financial support for graduate students, and funding can vary significantly among disciplines.\n[HEADING] Fully-funded programs\n[HEADING] Self-funded programs\n[HEADING] Partially-funded programs\n[HEADING] Applying for financial aid\n[HEADING] Application fee\n[HEADING] More information\nWhether a student receives funding, how much, and what form that financial support takes depends on the degree program to which they apply. These policies and practices will vary from program to program. Applicants are considered for appointments or awards after they have been accepted into a graduate program.\nWe understand that finances are an important factor in the decision to go to graduate school, and that navigating financial systems can prove challenging at times. Below, we have outlined common terms and definitions for the financial designations used by the Institute’s range of graduate programs.\nTypically, a “fully-funded” program provides tuition funding and salaries or stipends for all students in good standing. Financial support for graduate students in fully-funded or partially-funded programs may take the form of Research Assistantships, Teaching Assistantships, fellowships, traineeships, scholarships, grants, and/or other forms of employment, such as a Graduate Resident Advisor position in an undergraduate residence.\nTypically, a “self-funded” program requires its graduate students to provide financial resources for tuition and living expenses. Students enrolling in self-funded programs might cover these costs through outside grants, tuition reimbursement from their company (if employed full-time), loans, or independent financial resources. Some of our professional graduate programs, designed for mid-career individuals, may be self-funded.\nOther degree programs may have limited funding available for graduate students. This could mean that the academic department provides partial tuition funding or salary/stipend to each student, that available funding opportunities are highly competitive, or that funding is allocated in another way not mentioned here. Financial support may be allocated based on academic achievement, demonstrated financial hardship, or any other mechanism that the department may use.\nAs with fully-funded programs, common forms of funding are Research Assistantships, instructor and Teaching Assistantships, fellowships, traineeships, scholarships, and grants.\nWe encourage applicants to contact the program(s) that interest them to learn more about funding available for students. Please see our Degree Programs directory for more information about each program.\nThere is no separate application for financial aid prior to admission. Currently enrolled graduate students seeking financial support should consult with their departmental office or visit Student Financial Services.\nThe standard application fee is $90 for all departments and programs except in the Sloan School of Management.  Programs in the Sloan School of Management require application fees between $95–$250.\nFee waivers may be available on a limited basis. Please visit the Application Fee Waiver page for further information.\nWe do not offer refunds for applicants who are not eligible for admission or withdraw an application. If you have applied for a fee waiver, please wait to submit your graduate application until you receive a response from OGE; we are not able to apply fee waivers retroactively. If a technical error resulted in multiple transactions during the application submission process, please contact our gradadmissions@mit.edu.\nFor more detailed information regarding the cost of attendance for the 2024–2025 academic year, including specific costs for tuition and fees, books and supplies, housing and food as well as transportation, please visit the Student Financial Services website.

      "content": "[HEADING] Degree programs\n[HEADING] MIT offers a wide range of degrees and programs.\n[HEADING] Search Programs\nAll graduate students, whether or not they are participating in an interdepartmental program, must have a primary affiliation with and be registered in a single department. Every applicant accepted by MIT is admitted through one of the graduate departments. MIT has a number of established interdepartmental programs, and there are many more opportunities for students to arrange interdepartmental programs with interested faculty members.\nAll MIT graduate degree programs have residency requirements, which reflect academic terms (excluding summer). Some degrees also require completion of an acceptable thesis prepared in residence at MIT, unless special permission is granted for part of the thesis work to be accomplished elsewhere. Other degrees require a pro-seminar or capstone experience.\nApplicants interested in graduate education should apply to the department or graduate program conducting research in the area of interest. Below is an alphabetical list of all the available departments and programs that offer a graduate-level degree.\nInterested in reading first-hand accounts of MIT graduate students from a variety of programs?
