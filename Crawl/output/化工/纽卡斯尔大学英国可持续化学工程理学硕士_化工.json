To develop research skills by undertaking original investigative work via experiments and/or modelling.\r\n2. To develop scientific communication skills via writing a scientific journal paper. \r\n3. To introduce students to research techniques.\r\n4. To complete a literature review assignment, which will involve developing and improving skills in information gathering and analysis.\n1. The nature of research.\r\n2. Resources for research.\r\n3. Guidance on gathering information form literature, and using software such as Scopus for literature searching and analysis.\r\n4. Writing a literature survey.\r\n5. Writing a research paper: layout; key chapters; style; citing references; being critical; making arguments.\r\nThis provides an opportunity to deepen technical understanding through the application of theory to a project relevant to Chemical Engineering Practice. It also enables students to demonstrate their ability to focus on a solution in the context of often open ended problems.\r\nStudents carry out a unique project in a University environment which enables them to put into practice much of their theoretical and practical knowledge gained through the MSc programme. In addition it will enable additional skills acquired through first degree programmes to be extended into a sustainability.\nThe research project is worth 60 credits and allows students to build upon the skills and knowledge gained during the taught part of the programme. \r\nThe project may involve working within one of the School's established research groups, or students may work elsewhere in collaboration with industry typically through an industrial sponsor. The supervisor will provide advice on the approaches and methods that are best suited to the industrial or lab based research problem.  They gain the skills and knowledge delivered by the module by “learning through doing” as they undertake the project.\nThe format of resits will be determined by the Board of Examiners\nThe literature review and methodology report underpins the project allowing the student to develop sufficient knowledge in the area to plan and undertake the research project (AHEP4 M2-5,7,17).\r\nThe research project is written up as a scientific journal paper will allow students to undertake in depth research and communicate their findings in a succinct and focused manner and in the form in which research is usually communicated (AHEP4 M1-5,7,17). Assessment of students understanding and communication skills is supplemented by oral presentations both of the literature review and methodology report and the overall Project (AHEP4, M1-5,7,17).\n•

At Newcastle University, you’ll find a wide range of funding options, including scholarships and bursaries.\nThis guide will help you explore your options and access the support you need to fund your studies with confidence.\nYou'll find full details of expected fees on each course page. This will be detailed in the Fees and Funding section.\nThe fee amount reflects the cost of one year. Longer courses will have additional fees. Some courses involve intensive laboratory, clinical or fieldwork so may have higher fees.\nHome students registering for an eligible taught postgraduate course with a September start date can pay for their annual tuition fees in six installments.\nInternational students and research students need to pay half of their annual tuition fees to register at the university in September. The second half of your fees will be due in the following January.\nTuition fees are usually payable for each year of your study. If you begin your studies mid-year, you will only pay the proportion of your tuition fee due to cover the period to the end of the academic year.\nIf your course lasts longer than an academic year, the fee due in the following September will normally be higher than in the previous year, due to an inflationary increase.\nWe want to protect you by making sure you don't take unnecessary risks with your money. Therefore we do not accept cash as payments. We offer you many other payment options by safer and more secure means.\nUniversity tuition fees are not subject to exchange control regulations for Chinese students.\nYou may be unsure if you have home or international fee status.\nThe UK Council for International Student Affairs (UKCISA) provides guidance on who is eligible for home fees.\nWe will assess your fee status using the information in your postgraduate application. In some cases, we may ask you to complete a fees assessment questionnaire and send us extra documents. Confirmation of our assessment of your fees status will be in your offer letter.\nDepending on your residency history, if you’re a student from the EU, other EEA or a Swiss national, with settled or pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme, you’ll normally pay the ‘Home’ tuition fee rate and may be eligible for Student Finance England support.\nEU students without settled or pre-settled status will normally be charged fees at the ‘International’ rate and will not be eligible for Student Finance England support. You will however be eligible for a scholarship worth 15% off the international fee.\nPart-time fees for international students do not apply as your student visa requires you to study full time. There are occasional exceptions to this.\nWe support our EU and international students by providing a generous range of Vice-Chancellor's automatic and merit-based scholarships. See our searchable postgraduate funding page for more information.\nWe offer the following tuition fee discount schemes:\nOther funding awards can cover the cost of tuition fees.\nThe following types of funding provide you with financial support which you do not have to pay back. However, you must meet their eligibility criteria.\nWe support our EU and international students by providing a generous range of Vice-Chancellor's automatic and merit-based scholarships.\nWe also participate in a number of prestigious scholarship schemes such as Commonwealth and Fulbright, and jointly with these schemes offer some full scholarships.\nSee our searchable postgraduate funding page for more information.\nStudentships are funding for PhD programmes. They may cover your tuition fees, a living allowance (called a stipend) and contribution towards your travel and fieldwork expenses.\nStudentships may be funded by:\nSearch our funding database for studentships that are currently available.\nThese are normally based on academic merit or specific eligibility criteria such as the course you are applying for.\nThey can be fully or partially funded.\nThese are typically provided to help fund some of the additional costs associated with studying.\nA variety of organisations, including charities and trusts offer bursaries and awards.\nYou might find it helpful to take on part-time work during the academic year as well as during the vacations, to help fund your studies.\nOur Careers Service advertises part time, temporary and vacation positions. The Newcastle Work Experience initiative offers you the chance to gain paid work experience in local businesses and organisations.\nYou have several options to look at in terms of securing funding for your study including:\nOur course profile pages include details about typical funding sources for your prospective course.\nYou may also like to consider portfolio funding. This is when you build up your funding from different sources such as; bursaries, charities and trusts, loans and part-time work.\nThese websites provide a range of advice and information about awards, studentships, and scholarships. They also advertise teaching and research assistantships.\nThe Education UK website, is produced by the British Council to help international students interested in studying for a UK course or qualification. It provides a comprehensive guide to fees and scholarships.\nYou must ensure you have adequate funds to cover your expenses while you study.\nWe understand that sometimes unforeseen financial difficulties occur.\nIf your situation could prevent you from continuing to study, discretionary financial support may be available.\nOur Student Wellbeing Service has Financial Advisors who can support you with help and advice if you find yourself in financial difficulty while studying at Newcastle.\n• Careers\n• Library\n• Current Students\n• Staff\n• News & Press\n• Events\n• Contact\n•
