      "content": "[HEADING] Degree Logistics\n[HEADING] Curriculum Structure\nThe principal objective of the Master of Engineering Program is to prepare individuals for professional practice in a broad range of areas by enhancing the skill sets developed in an undergraduate engineering program. For the master’s degree in Energy, Environmental & Chemical Engineering (EECE), students can choose a pathway of specialization in specific topical areas. Other goals of the professional master’s degree are to provide training in leadership skills and teamwork and experience with field and international issues.\nThis is a coursework-based masters program requiring 30 credits. A full-time student could complete the degree program in 12-16 months. Part-time students will require a longer duration. The curriculum is geared to enhance skill sets for practice in industry. Courses required for this program will provide a broader background in project management, business, leadership, and entrepreneurship. Students can choose a set of electives to obtain certificates in specialized tracks.\nWe welcome all interested applicants with a bachelor’s degree in engineering, physical sciences, or life sciences. The program is designed to be completed in 12-16 months (potentially including summer courses), but it can be completed over a longer time period on a part-time basis.\nThe degree requires 30 units of coursework and includes courses from outside of engineering that are relevant to professional engineering practice. These include courses in project management, and social and policy aspects. Students who have not taken engineering-level mathematics (2-3 semesters of calculus + 1 semester of differential equations) as part of their bachelor's degree may wish to take these courses prior to taking any of the MEng program's technical core or advanced mathematics courses. Any math courses taken solely in preparation for the core courses will likely be at the undergraduate level, however, and will not count towards this graduate degree.\nUp to 6 units of independent study (EECE 500) credit can be received for faculty-advised research projects, industry-directed projects, or a practicum/internship completed over the summer term. Approval by the Advisor is necessary for independent study credits. Note that the degree earned will be a Master of Engineering, even if research is done by the student.\nPathways are available in Advanced Energy Technologies; Bioengineering and Biotechnology; Energy and Environmental Nanotechnology; Energy and Environmental Management; and Environmental Engineering Science.\nThe list of courses is dynamic, and will change from time to time. Students have the flexibility of choosing other classes with the permission of their academic advisor. Please check the latest listing.\nIn addition to classes, students will have regular meetings with personnel from industry and are advised to attend EECE Seminars held on Fridays at 11 a.m. The EECE department also hosts a career fair each fall semester.\nMaster's and PhD Application Process\nLearn more about WashU's MEng/MBA\nFrequently asked questions for Master's degree students\nThis FAQ is published by our department to help our faculty, staff and students. Suggestions for improving this FAQ are most welcome and may be submitted to the Curriculum Committee.\nE60-505 - Communication tools for Academic and Professional Success\nMcKelvey School of Engineering requires all incoming international students who submit a TOEFL or IETLS score or has not obtained a minimum of 3 years of education in the U.S. to take a course in communication. This new course was first offered in Fall of 2018. This course does not cost extra for full-time students and is not counted toward the degree or the GPA.\nTrent SilbaughLecturer314-935-6014tsilbaugh@wustl.edu\nengineeringgradadmissions@wustl.edu\n• Core courses selected from a menu of options (see course listing document)\n• 5 elective courses (15 total credits)\n\nAny relevant WashU courses 400-level and higher (max of two 400-level courses)\nElectives can be chosen to complete a pathway that will result in a certificate\n• Any relevant WashU courses 400-level and higher (max of two 400-level courses)\n• Electives can be chosen to complete a pathway that will result in a certificate\n• All courses comprising the required 30 credits must be taken for a grade (i.e., cannot be taken pass/fail), and a minimum GPA of 2.70 is required for graduation\n• A joint MEng/MBA program is also available.

The student must provide an official transcript, course description and/or syllabi, text book title and an indication of a matching Wash U course. A grade of B or better is required for transfer courses. The transfer courses must be graduate level and did not count toward the completion of an undergraduate degree.\nNo, only courses taken for a grade count toward the degree requirements. A student may choose to take a course as P/F in order to gain the knowledge needed for another course in the program. P/F courses count toward full-time status.  Audited courses do not count toward degrees, grade point averages nor full-time status.  P/F courses and Audit courses are charged regular tuition.\nIf it is a degree from a different department within the School of Engineering, you may need to complete an application. A graduate certificate may require a mini-application and/or permission from the Program Director. Contact the Graduate Admissions department for specifics on whether or not an application is required.\nThe number of units may vary depending on the degree. Typically a minimum of 15 unique units will be required for the second master's degree. The date the course was first taken must be within a maximum of 10 years. Courses become outdated and therefore would not count toward a current degree.",
