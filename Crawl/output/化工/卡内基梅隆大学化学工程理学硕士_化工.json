As they reflect on their time since graduating, a common theme is the value of the collaborative learning environment in the Department of Chemical Engineering. Contributing to the community that supported them, four recent graduates offer advice to current students and new graduates.\nSource: Akhil Nair\nAkhil Nair is an advanced process controls and optimization engineer at Corning Incorporated. On the technical enhancement team, he handles development projects related to all of Corning's business verticals. Nair's major areas of work are in optimization-based process modeling, system identification, and developing MPC applications. \"I successfully applied all of my learnings in process systems engineering at Carnegie Mellon in a fast-paced environment, to deliver a sophisticated software package which is now in production across Corning in China, Korea, and the US,\" he says.\nNair advises current students that all the course assignments are created intentionally. \"Applying the concepts we learned to solve them by ourselves really helps to develop the right mindset to tackle problems in industry,\" he says. As an alum, Nair misses being able to learn in the fast-paced way he did at CMU. He also misses Friday evening happy hours and the campus.\nSource: Yufeng Qian\nYufeng Qian\nYufeng Qian is a chemical engineering Ph.D. student at the University of Pittsburgh. \"I am proud that everything went smoothly this year,\" he says. Qian is passionate about artificial intelligence and deploying deep learning technology into the chemical engineering field.\nReflecting on his time since graduating from CMU, he misses his cohort and is glad to have helped some of his friends along their career paths. Qian's advice to this year's graduates: \"cherish those who are around you.\"\nSource: Anchit Singhal\nAnchit Singhal\nAnchit Singhal is an LTD process engineer at Intel Corporation. He uses statistical process control and data analysis techniques to ensure optimum product yield and quality. His role also requires monitoring and optimizing chemical parameters that affect production.\n\"I have been involved in some very exciting technologies in the semiconductor industry,\" Singhal says of his first year on the job. \"I had the opportunity to learn from many bright and innovative people, who have witnessed the chip industry grow for more than three decades.\"\nSinghal advises new graduates that it's important to use all the resources and support provided for professional growth and development. Working on interesting projects alongside brilliant minds from all around the world was invaluable to him. Although he misses his friends and professors in the Department of Chemical Engineering, Singhal has found the transition from academia to industry exhilarating. \"It's very intellectually stimulating to apply the knowledge and skills gained in graduate studies on industrial projects that affect the lives of so many people worldwide,\" he says.\nSource: Ananya Srivastava\nAnanya Srivastava\nAnanya Srivastava is a research and development (R&D) strategy analyst at Amogy, a sustainable energy startup developing a novel carbon-free energy system using ammonia as a renewable fuel. She works closely with both engineering and business teams to plan the technical development roadmap of the company and define its R&D scope. Her main responsibilities include conducting high-level Aspen simulation studies and providing technical support to the business teams.\nSrivastava says the time since she graduated has been an adventure: navigating the job market as an international student, moving to a new city, transitioning from student life to the professional world, and diving into her first full-time job. \"I embraced it all,\" she says. \"The past year has been a whirlwind, but every hurdle I faced just made the journey even sweeter.\"\nThrough it all, Srivastava has found valuable guidance and support from peers and mentors. \"From late-night study sessions to tackling tough assignments together, my classmates were my support system,\" she says. The collaborative learning environment in the Department of Chemical Engineering and the opportunity to work closely with professors inspired her to delve deeper into the field. She advises this year's graduates never to underestimate the significance of networking and creating relationships within the industry.\nSrivastava also advises new graduates to make lifelong learning a part of their lives and remain curious about emerging technologies and industry trends. \"The field of chemical engineering is constantly transforming, so it's vital to be adaptable and willing to learn new skills,\" she says.\nCatch up with MChE grad Aaron Garrison",

Elective courses focus on the fundamentals of modeling, optimization, data science, and scientific computing. You'll develop unique and valuable expertise with applications in chemical processes, sustainability and green energy, supply chains, production planning and scheduling, and carbon capture and reduction.\nExample courses\nThe atmosphere is the ultimate chemical reactor with complex interacting systems that are rapidly changing with time. Elective courses on air quality and climate will prepare you to analyze large observation datasets on the planet, model atmospheric dynamics, develop climate change mitigation strategies, and quantify how policies will impact various groups of people.\nExample courses\nYou'll develop engineering expertise applicable to drug development and the health care/biotechnology industry, such as biotherapeutics and vaccines that prevent or cure disease. In these electives, you will obtain skills and knowledge that will qualify you for opportunities in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. The MS in Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical Engineering (MS-BTPE) program is another option to pursue your interest in these topics.\nExample courses\nThe increased urgency to deal with climate change has pushed leaders, governments, and industrial stakeholders around the globe to converge on massive financial programs that promote and incentivize decarbonization, sustainability, and energy transition technologies. This is leading to the creation of many new professional opportunities. In electives enriched by state-of-the-art modeling tools and AI, you will gain a skill set that is unique in the workforce for the coming decades. You'll be immersed in the concepts and technical details of core technologies that an engineer needs to shape the decarbonization landscape of tomorrow.\nExample courses\nSoft matter and colloids serve as the backbone of an array of consumer products and advanced materials that touch our lives daily. In these electives, you will delve into the scientific principles governing these substances. You'll gain an interdisciplinary perspective that combines domains in chemistry, physics, and engineering, and you'll develop expertise applicable to research and development, materials engineering, and process engineering.\nExample courses\n• Master’s programs\n• MS, Applied Study, MChE\n• MS in AIE-ChE\n• MS-BTPE\n• IMB application\n• Advanced modeling, optimization, and data science\n• Air quality and climate\n• Biopharmaceutical engineering\n• Decarbonization, sustainability, and energy transition technologies\n• Soft matter, colloids, and complex fluids\n• 06-720 Advanced Process Systems Engineering (12 units)\n• 06-606 Computational Methods for Large Scale Process Design & Analysis (9 units)\n• 06-681 Data Science and Machine Learning in Chemical Engineering (6 units) and 06-682 Data Science and Machine Learning in Chemical Engineering: Scientific Software (6 units); or 18-661 Introduction to Machine Learning for Engineers (12 units); or 24-787 Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence for Engineers (12 units)\n• 06-614 Atmospheric Nanoparticles and Climate (12 units)\n• 12-651 Air Quality Engineering (9 units)\n• 06-724 Global Atmospheric Chemistry (12 units)\n• 06-722 Bioprocess Design (12 units)\n• 06-685 Bioseparations and Spectroscopy (12 units)\n• 06-612 Formulation Engineering (12 units); or 06-634 Drug Delivery Systems (9 units); or 42-620 Engineering Molecular Cell Biology (12 units)\n• 24-722 Energy Systems Modeling (12 units)\n• 19-627 Special Topics: Energy Innovation and Entrepreneurship (12 units)\n• 90-808 US Energy and Climate Policy (6 units) and 39-612 Energy Policy and Economics (6 units); or 39-610 Energy Conversion and Supply (6 units) and 39-611 Energy Demand and Utilization (6 units)\n• 06-686 Special topics: Polymers for a Sustainable Future (9 units)\n• 06-607 Physical Chemistry of Colloids & Surfaces (9 units)\n• 06-609 Physical Chemistry of Macromolecules (9 units); or 27-557 Advanced Polymer Science and Engineering (12 units)\n• 06-612 Formulation Engineering (12 units)\n• 06-686 Special topics: Polymers for a Sustainable Future (9 units)",
