You do not need to apply to the Online Birmingham Masters Scholarship if your course is not listed below; only students intending to study one of the below 14 online degrees should apply to the Online Birmingham Masters Scholarship.

Only once you have responded and accepted the scholarship will you receive the award; if you decline or do not respond by the deadline specified in your offer email, your scholarship will be reallocated.\nAfter accepting the scholarship, you will need to accept your study offer and complete online registration to receive the £3,000 tuition fee waiver; delays in completing online registration will result in the delaying of the scholarship payment.\nBy accepting the scholarship you accept the terms and conditions of the Birmingham Masters Scholarship.\nThe Birmingham Masters Scholarship is a £3,000 fee waiver and will be applied directly to your tuition fees; the waiver cannot be exchanged for any monetary value nor can it be paid directly to you. When paying the remainder of your tuition fees, whether by direct debit (monthly or termly) or a single payment, you will only need to pay the remaining value of your tuition fees minus the £3,000 waiver. Tuition fee payments will only be applicable once a student has completed online registration and enrolment.\nDetailed information and guidance on how to pay your tuition fees can be found on our Funding pages.\nIf you are successfully awarded the Birmingham Masters Scholarship, your £3,000 tuition fee waiver will be applied directly to your tuition fee account. However, you will not receive an updated invoice reflecting the discounted value. You will need to manually deduct the £3,000 discount from your full tuition fees to calculate your outstanding fees that you are liable for.\nApplications will be reviewed and marked after their respective deadlines. Successful applicants will be contacted typically within 3-4 weeks after the respective scholarship application deadline has passed. A scholarship offer email will be sent to awardees to accept or decline the scholarship offer; a deadline to respond will be included in this email. Students who are made a reserve will be contacted in due course as soon as any reallocated scholarships become available.\nDue to the volume of applications for the scholarship, we are unable to offer individual responses to each application. Although we endeavour to keep you informed of scholarship updates, if you have not been contacted by the timeframes outlined in the above paragraph or by your course's start date, it may be the unfortunate case that your application has unsuccessful.\nNo. As per the terms and conditions, the scholarship cannot be deferred and it is only tenable for one year. If you choose to defer your studies, you will need to re-apply for the scholarship in the next cycle if available.\nGenerally, you will be able to hold other scholarships in conjunction with the Birmingham Masters Scholarship, such as the Postgraduate Access Scholarship. However, you cannot hold the Birmingham Masters Scholarship in conjunction with any scholarship that covers the full tuition fee, whether awarded by the University or an external organisation or sponsor.\nIt should be noted that the Birmingham Masters Scholarship and the Online Birmingham Masters Scholarship are both offered through the overall Birmingham Masters Scholarship Scheme.
