This degree prepares students for a variety of career paths. MS candidates are expected to complete the degree requirements in 1.5 - 2 years of full-time study.\nThe MS program requires 30 credit hours of coursework and includes a completed a research project requiring significant independent work  conducted under supervision of a faculty member on a topic of interest to the student. The project is presented to the committee during the Master’s Examination.\nThere is a six-year time limit for application of credit earned in course work or research toward fulfilling MS-degree requirements. A maximum of six (6) semester credit hours may be accepted for candidates transferring into the MS-degree program.\nThe minimum course requirements beyond the Bachelor’s degree are classified into the following areas:\nThe total core course requirements are 12 credit hours. These courses and the material prerequisite to them must be mastered by all M.S. students.\nCBE 8808 (3 cr) – Advanced Thermodynamics I\nCBE 8812 (3 cr) – Advanced Kinetics I\nCBE 8815 (3 cr) – Advanced Transport\nCBE 8781 (2 cr) – Research Communications in CBE\nChem 6781 (1 cr) – Laboratory Safety\nPlease choose one from the following list:\nCBE5779 - Experimental Design\nMath 4568 - Linear Algebra for Engineering Graduate Students\nStatistics - Graduate level courses of 5000 level or higher, please see the BuckeyeLink for a listing of Statistics courses.\nSix credit hours of graduate level courses in chemical and biomolecular engineering, or other scientific, mathematics, or engineering disciplines are to be selected to fit the candidate’s goals.\nNine credits. A thesis project conducted under supervision of a faculty advisor on a topic of interest to the student. The completed a research project requires both significant independent work under the supervision of a Thesis Advisor and production of an extended written description of it.\nThe Master’s Examination will comprise of two components: 1) A written thesis summarizing the independent project; 2) An oral presentation and defense of the project to the committee.

The project may be an in-depth study and analysis of technical literature on the topic of interest, or an original project involving experimental, computational, and/or theoretical work. In-career students can complete the project at their work location.\nThe Master’s Examination is comprised two components:\nOne semester prior to your planned graduation, notify the Graduate Program Coordinator to set up a meeting. This will provide sufficient time for the Graduate Studies Committee to review your academic record, and to formally ensure that you have met the department's graduation requirements.\nAn Application to Graduate form must be submitted through GradForms. Note: The completed and approved online form must be submitted to the Graduate School by the end of the third Friday of the semester in which you wish to graduate.\nQuestions?\nContact Angela Bennett, Graduate Program Coordinator, bennett.234@osu.edu\nSample Study Plan for Chemical Engineering Students:\nAutumn Semester:\nCBE 8815\nMath Elective\nChemi 6781\nTech Elective (3 cr.)\nSpring Semester:\nCBE 8808\nCBE 8812\nCBE 8781\nTech Elective (3 cr.)\n\nSummer or Autumn Semester:\nTech Elective (3 cr.)\nTech Elective (3 cr.)\nTech Elective (3 cr.)\nIndependent Thesis Project (3 cr.)\nSample Study Plan for Chemistry Students:\nYear 1:\nAutumn Semester:\nMath 2177\nCBE 2420\nCBE 3508\nCBE 3610\nTech Elective (3 cr.)\nChem 6781\nSpring Semester:\nCBE 3421\nCBE 3422\nCBE 3509\nCBE 8781\nYear 2:\nAutumn Semester:\nMath Elective\nCBE 8815\nTech Elective (3 cr.)\nSpring Semester:\nCBE 8808\nCBE 8812\nTech Elective (3 cr.)\n\nSummer or Autumn Semester:\nTech Elective (3 cr.)\nTech Elective (3 cr.)\nIndependent Thesis Project (3 cr.)\n• A written report summarizing the independent thesis project;\n• An oral presentation and defense of the project to the committee.
