The nanotechnology concentration signifies that four elective courses are chosen from the approved courses in this area. Admission is in accordance with the general requirements of the graduate division, which requires at least a B.S. in some branch of engineering, sciences, or mathematics; an overall GPA of 3.0, and three letters of recommendation from individuals who can attest to the academic or professional competence and to the depth of their interest in pursuing graduate study.\nApplicants are judged competitively. Based on the candidate’s background, qualifications, and goals, admission to the program is in one of three categories: M.S. only, M.S., or Ph.D. Admission to the M.S. only category is reserved for students for whom the M.S. degree is likely to be the terminal graduate degree. The M.S. designation is reserved for students currently interested in obtaining an M.S. degree but who at a later time may wish to continue in the doctoral degree program.\nAdmission to the Ph.D. Program is reserved for qualified students whose final aim is a doctoral degree. Non-matriculated students are welcome to seek enrollment in graduate-level courses via UC Extension’s concurrent registration program, but an extension student’s enrollment in a graduate course must be approved by the instructor.\n• 2025 - 2026 Academic Year *Subject to Change\n[GRID_TABLE]\nChemical Engineering\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Chemical Engineering Program offers graduate instruction leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in chemical engineering.
