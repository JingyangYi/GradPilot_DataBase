The degrees can be completed through one of three pathways.\nComplete all coursework requirements outlined below.\nComplete all coursework requirements outlined below, complete 6 credits of independent study, and submit a research report to your research advisor and external reviewer for approval. The research report is not formally published.\nComplete all coursework requirements outlined below, complete 6 credits of master’s research, submit a thesis to your committee for formal acceptance, and successfully defend your thesis work. The thesis will be published through the McKelvey School of Engineering.\nThe core course structure is the same for all MS in EECE degree pathways, except that 6 units of research courses are selected for the research project and thesis options in place of electives credits. A total of 30 credits is required for graduation (24 credits of coursework and 6 credits of research for the research project and thesis options). Students who have not taken engineering-level mathematics (2-3 semesters of calculus + 1 semester of differential equations) as part of their bachelor's degree could take these courses prior to taking any of the MS program's core or advanced mathematics courses. Any math courses taken solely in preparation for the core courses will likely be at the undergraduate level, however, and will not count towards this graduate degree.\nIn addition to classes, students are advised to attend EECE seminars held on Fridays at 11 a.m. The EECE department also hosts a career fair each fall semester.\nTo make students competitive in a broader range of industries, EECE developed diverse programs as a way to give your degree a “theme”. Options include the following:\nIf you want to specialize with another master’s degree, it is relatively easy to do so at WashU. For a second master’s in the McKelvey School of Engineering, up to 15 credits can be shared between the degrees.\nLearn more about the joint master’s programs and MBA with the Olin School of Business\nDoctoral students may also receive a Master of Science in EECE “along the way” in their PhD program.  They should have passed the PhD proposal defense, completed 30 units of required coursework, and published or submitted at least one peer-reviewed journal manuscript from their thesis research.\nThe MS degree will help you to pursue your passion in a field of your choice. Our alumni have careers in a variety of in-demand areas such as:\nWashington University and McKelvey School of Engineering provides broad support for student career development. The MS degree also prepares students who want to further their study by pursuing a doctoral degree.\nE60-505 - Communication tools for Academic and Professional Success\nMcKelvey School of Engineering requires all incoming international students who submit a TOEFL or IETLS score or has not obtained a minimum of 3 years of education in the U.S. to take a course in communication. This new course was first offered in Fall of 2018. This course does not cost extra for full-time students and is not counted toward the degree or the GPA.\nWashU hosts a diverse graduate student body. Extensive support can be found in the Office for International Students and Scholars.

      "content": "[HEADING] Program Overview\nDue to the rapidly growing interest in the intersection between Engineering and Business, and how the approaches to the issues of sustainability, energy, the environment and corporate social responsibility, and the Department of Energy, Environmental and chemical Engineering (EECE) and the Olin School of Business launched a dual degree program - MEng/MBA.\nAn interdisciplinary approach to these issues provides students with effective, innovative and critical thinking skills to find effective and impactful solutions.\nThe Olin MBA curriculum offers a comprehensive set of required and elective courses built upon a foundation of critical-thinking and leadership skills. Olin MBAs are able to shape the curriculum to meet their unique personal objectives, incorporating the MEng degree requirements.\nStudents pursuing the MEng/MBA option may, of course, choose whichever core courses and pathway electives they prefer for the MEng. However, we expect many will choose to pursue the Energy & Environmental Management Pathway, which will complement the MBA course work. Both MEng and MBA degrees will be awarded simultaneously at the completion of the program.\nMaster's and PhD Application Process\nOlin Business School MBA Information\nFrequently asked questions for Master's degree students\nE60-505 - Communication tools for Academic and Professional Success\nMcKelvey School of Engineering requires all incoming international students who submit a TOEFL or IETLS score or has not obtained a minimum of 3 years of education in the U.S. to take a course in communication.

The student must provide an official transcript, course description and/or syllabi, text book title and an indication of a matching Wash U course. A grade of B or better is required for transfer courses. The transfer courses must be graduate level and did not count toward the completion of an undergraduate degree.\nNo, only courses taken for a grade count toward the degree requirements. A student may choose to take a course as P/F in order to gain the knowledge needed for another course in the program. P/F courses count toward full-time status.  Audited courses do not count toward degrees, grade point averages nor full-time status.  P/F courses and Audit courses are charged regular tuition.\nIf it is a degree from a different department within the School of Engineering, you may need to complete an application. A graduate certificate may require a mini-application and/or permission from the Program Director. Contact the Graduate Admissions department for specifics on whether or not an application is required.\nThe number of units may vary depending on the degree. Typically a minimum of 15 unique units will be required for the second master's degree. The date the course was first taken must be within a maximum of 10 years. Courses become outdated and therefore would not count toward a current degree.",
