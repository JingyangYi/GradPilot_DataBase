Energy. Environment. This triad of engineering priorities is perhaps unmatched in its potential for improving the quality of life for all inhabitants of planet Earth. And at the heart of all three is chemical engineering, which holds the key to a healthier, cleaner and more efficient world, and a better tomorrow for all.\nTo expand the reach of chemical engineering around the world, the Stanford Chemical Engineering department offers a part-time master’s degree program, with the option to complete coursework completely online.\nIf you want to pursue the degree on a part-time basis, so as not to interrupt your career, you can enroll in as few as one course per quarter.\nFor added flexibility, you can take courses online or in-person on Stanford’s campus. Each quarter, numerous chemical engineering and other engineering courses are available online. Not all chemical engineering courses are available online, but you can complete the degree fully online.\nMaster’s degree students can combine Chemical Engineering studies with a wide range of engineering coursework offered by Stanford. You will take core chemical engineering courses in areas like chemical kinetics, molecular thermodynamics and biochemical engineering. Then follow your own interests and goals by selecting elective courses in areas like entrepreneurship, optimization, energy or applied mathematics. All program proposals will be reviewed and approved by an advisor.\nIf you want more flexibility than the part-time master's degree, you can apply to take individual chemical engineering courses or pursue a graduate certificate in chemical engineering. Upon successful completion of each course, you will receive academic credit and a Stanford University transcript.\nIf you later choose to apply and are admitted into the master's degree program at Stanford, you may apply up to 18 units towards the master's degree (pending department approval).\nNot sure which of these credentials is right for you? Compare our graduate certificate vs. master's degree.\nTo earn the Master of Science in Chemical Engineering degree, you must complete 45 units.\nFor admissions information, please visit the Chemical Engineering department's site or contact chemicalengineering@stanford.edu.\nFor degree requirements, please review either the department’s Stanford Bulletin. See the FAQs page.\nFor more about the policies, procedures, and logistics, please review our website.\nSOE-YHAPATICS\nStanford School of Engineering\n100% Online, on-demand, EdX\n-     \n

An applicant may apply to only one degree program at Stanford University, meaning the applicant must choose one department and degree program and can have only one active application. All components of an application to the Department of Chemical Engineering must be received by the department no later than the appropriate due date. Applications and supporting documentation from external applicants are accepted on a rolling basis for autumn and spring start. All components of a MS application must be received by the department prior to the due date. All applicants must make an official application, using the university's online forms and procedures, and following the directions from the Office of the Registrar, Graduate Admissions. Visit the Grad Admissions site for more information about the graduate admissions process at Stanford and to apply for graduate admission.We invite excellent students from all backgrounds, including those from historically underrepresented groups in engineering, to consider Stanford University for their graduate studies. In making admissions decisions, the Department of Chemical Engineering will comply with the requirements of the law as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States, evaluating each applicant based on their “experiences as an individual—not on the basis of race.” We continue to value a diverse student body that benefits the educational experience of our students and our mission of generating knowledge at Stanford University.What are the application deadlines?For our MS program, applications and supporting documentation from external applicants are accepted on a rolling basis for autumn and spring start. Applications for Fall 2025 admission are closed. Applications for Fall 2026 admission will open in September 2025.Spring Quarter Admission DeadlineJanuary 8, 2026Autumn Quarter Admission DeadlineApril 1, 2026Application MaterialsCompleted Online ApplicationStatement of Purpose(2 pages)Recommendations from three people who can knowledgeably discuss your suitability for pursuit of the selected degree.Bio-demographic information, educational history and test results (official and self-reported scores and percentages).Transcripts (Current, unofficial transcript uploaded in your application. Do not send physical transcripts to the department). Official transcripts will only be required if you are accepted. Communication regarding how to submit your transcripts will be sent as part of your acceptance.Email: chemicalengineering@stanford.edu (for graduate admission inquiries)The Department of Chemical Engineering does not accept letters of recommendation submitted through Interfolio.Application evaluationOur admissions committee carefully considers all completed applications to Chemical Engineering's HCP MS program.  Decisions are based on the student’s academic record and experiences, letters of recommendation, statement of purpose, and test scores. While most applicants to our advanced degree programs have traditional chemical engineering backgrounds, we do accept applications from students in other related fields: chemistry, physics, mechanical engineering, biology and so forth.If your bachelor’s degree is in another field, do you have sufficient background knowledge in the key engineering concepts required of an undergraduate majoring in chemical engineering and thus would thrive in an advanced degree chemical engineering program? Those with non-traditional backgrounds should expect, if admitted, to spend some additional time acquiring the background necessary to complete a graduate degree in chemical engineering.  For reference, the requirements for a Stanford BS in Chemical Engineering can be found in the Handbook for Undergraduate Engineering ProgramsA departmental committee of Chemical Engineering faculty members makes all decisions regarding admission to our advanced degree programs. Decisions are based on thorough evaluations of all aspects of completed applications, i.e. applications are evaluated in their entirety and within the context of the program pool. Hence, final decisions are not made on a rolling basis, but rather when the pool is complete, on the deadline date.We are unable to provide informal recommendations or evaluations on the basis of partial information, e.g. a CV or test scores or a transcript. Inquiries and materials sent to individual professors will be redirected to administrative staff. We encourage potential applicants to consider discussing their issues with faculty recommenders who know them well and could give better, individualized academic advice.HCP Master’s Admissions Frequently Asked QuestionsCan HCP MS students apply for the Knight-Hennessy Scholars Program?No; Knight-Hennessy is for full-time students only. The HCP MS program only allows for part-time enrollment.My official test scores will not arrive by the application deadline! Can I still apply?Yes, you may still apply. You should take your ETS tests and request that scores be submitted to Stanford as well. Your application will not be considered complete until your official transcripts and test scores arrive. We will contact otherwise competitive applicants with incomplete applications for follow-up. Be sure your e-email address and telephone number are correct.Are TOEFL scores required for admission?In general, yes, if your first language is not English. On your application, self-report both your ETS scores and percentages. The Graduate Admissions website has further details about the university-wide test requirements and exceptions.

Current research in our lab focuses on three main research themes: DNA Biophysics, Protein Self Assembly, and Charge Transport in Conjugated Polymers. These broad research areas offer complementary perspectives on chemical and physical processes, and we leverage this complementarity throughout our research. Our approach draws from a diverse range of theoretical and computational methods, including analytical theory of semiflexible polymers, polymer field theory, continuum elastic mechanics, Brownian dynamics simulation, equilibrium and dynamic Monte Carlo simulations, and analytical theory and numerical simulations of reaction-diffusion phenomena. A common thread in our work is the need to capture phenomena over many length and time scales, and our flexibility in research methodologies allows us to address these problems at an unprecedented level of precision.\n• James Swartz\n\nJames H.

Payment for quarterly tuition and fees is due upon receipt of enrollment notification. Tuition and fees must be paid in full; installment payments are not allowed. Payment may be made by credit card, wire transfer, direct invoice to a company, purchase order, company voucher, letter of credit, company check, or Yellow Ribbon tuition benefits (for veterans).\nIf you pay using a credit card, a receipt will automatically be sent to you by email. The receipt will be sent to the preferred email address listed in your mystanfordconnection account. If you need a receipt at a later date, please contact us at stanfordonline-gradprograms@stanford.edu.\nIf your company has agreed to pay for your tuition, our finance department will send an invoice to your company within seven days after the quarter’s final study list deadline. Late payment fees will be charged to the student’s account, unless noted otherwise.\nTuition and fees payable to the Stanford Engineering Center for Global & Online Education include:\nAll other fees, such as housing, health insurance, and petition fees to change course enrollment after the deadline must be paid directly to the university through Student Financial Services.\nBoth the university and CGOE tuition and fees are subject to annual review and may be adjusted. All changes will take effect at the start of autumn quarter and are applicable for the duration of the academic year.\nBefore the Financial Add/Drop Deadline, all tuition paid to the Stanford Engineering Center for Global & Online Education for courses dropped will be refunded in full, less any late fees that are assessed.\nAfter the Financial Add/Drop Deadline, tuition and fees paid to the Stanford Engineering Center for Global & Online Education will not be subject to refund except under the following circumstances:\n1. Medical emergency (hospitalization or major medical condition of the student). Official written and signed documentation from a physician will be required (which notes date originally seen, diagnosis and prognosis).\n2. Death of a “close family” member. “Close family” is limited to the student’s spouse, domestic partner, children, parents and parents-in-law, parent surrogate, brothers and sisters, grandparents and grandchildren. Written documentation will be required (Death Certificate).\n3. A call to active military duty (in the event of a national emergency such as in a time of war). Written documentation will be required.\n4. Leave of Absence - If you are approved for leave of absence before the start of the quarter, you are eligible to receive a full tuition refund.\nIf you are approved for leave of absence before the withdrawal deadline, you are eligible to receive a prorated refund based on your days of attendance. CGOE will invoice you after the per diem tuition fee appears in your Axess account. Please pay through your mystanfordconnection account, not Axess. There is no tuition refund for leaves taken after the Term Withdrawal deadline.\nFor more information, please review Stanford's deadlines and refund policy for leaves of absence.\nIf you are due a refund and your original payment was made by credit card, that same credit card account will be credited within 5 business days. If you made payment via wire transfer, a check will be issued as a refund within 10 business days of the wire transfer clearing. If the payment was made by company check, the company will be granted a refund by check.\n• Overview\n• Technical Support\n• Master's Degrees\n\n\nMaster’s Application FAQs\n\n\nMaster’s Student FAQs\n\n\nMaster's Tuition & Fees\n\n\nGrades & Policies\n\n\nHCP 70th Anniversary\n\n\nHCP History\n• Master’s Application FAQs\n• Master’s Student FAQs\n• Master's Tuition & Fees\n• Grades & Policies\n• HCP 70th Anniversary\n\n\nHCP History\n• HCP History\n• Graduate Courses & Certificates\n\n\nGraduate Application FAQs\n\n\nGraduate Student FAQs\n\n\nGraduate Tuition & Fees\n\n\nGrades & Policies\n\n\nCommunity Standards Review Process\n\n\nAcademic Calendar\n• Graduate Application FAQs\n• Graduate Student FAQs\n• Graduate Tuition & Fees\n• Grades & Policies\n• Community Standards Review Process\n• Academic Calendar\n• Exams & Homework FAQs\n• Master’s Application FAQs\n• Master’s Student FAQs\n• Master's Tuition & Fees\n• Grades & Policies\n• HCP 70th Anniversary\n\n\nHCP History\n• HCP History\n• HCP History\n• Graduate Application FAQs\n• Graduate Student FAQs\n• Graduate Tuition & Fees\n• Grades & Policies\n• Community Standards Review Process\n• Academic Calendar\n• The document fee for matriculated students admitted to a new degree is $250.
