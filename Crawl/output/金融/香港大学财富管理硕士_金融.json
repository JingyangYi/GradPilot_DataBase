increasing demand from high-net-worth families for professionals who can effectively manage the complex and diverse needs of their family offices. Beyond finance and wealth management, professionals need to possess well-rounded knowledge across history, ethics, cultural competence, and social responsibility to be able to evaluate and advise on complex family wealth management problems.The one-year taught Master of Family Wealth Management [MFWM] programme is jointly offered by the HKU Business School and the Hong Kong Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences (HKIHSS).  HKIHSS is an independent research institute at The University of Hong Kong (HKU), which has a long history of research and teaching in the history of family business, family succession and dynasty case study, asset allocation and investment management. The programme offers an interdisciplinary mix of skills and knowledge courses that will help students develop the soft and hard competencies required for a successful career within family wealth management. Graduates of the programme will be well-prepared to meet the evolving needs of high-net-worth families and help maximise their clients' chance to leave an ever-lasting family legacy.The MFWM curriculum emphasizes the cross-section between the historical roots and cultural dimensions of the family, family business, and investment markets. Core courses cover key topics such as history of family business, estate planning, asset allocation, investment management, and family office management. Elective courses further students' knowledge on these key topics. The curriculum finishes with a capstone project providing students the option to conduct research on and propose possible solutions to a practical issue faced by family offices and wealth managers, or to pursue an internship practicum in the industry.\n\n\nEntrance Requirements\n\n1.
