It is the duty of students to discuss any attendance issues with the field course or placement convenor.\nStudents are representatives of the university during their fieldwork or placement. Behaviour deemed by the convenor to be unacceptable may result in students being sent home.\nWhere a student is unable to attend or complete the fieldwork or placement (e.g. due to mitigating circumstances), is prevented from attending due to absence from compulsory preparatory classes, or returned home due to poor conduct:\nImmigration, passport and visa requirements\nIt is the responsibility of the individual student to ensure they have:\nThe School cannot guarantee that visas required for fieldwork or a placement will be granted by the relevant authority.
