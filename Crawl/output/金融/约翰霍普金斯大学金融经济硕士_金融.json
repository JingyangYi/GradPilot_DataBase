If you’re interested in advancing your career as a financial analyst, adviser, or consultant, a graduate degree program in financial economics can help you develop the in-demand specialized knowledge and skills employers value.\nRead on to learn the core components of graduate study in financial economics and how a degree program can position you for success in the dynamic world of finance.\nProfessionals in financial economics identify economic trends and help maintain financial stability for public and private institutions—and for the overall economy. Studying financial economics at the graduate level can help you develop quantitative skills, economic tools, and the ability to conduct empirical market analyses. Through a financial economics master’s degree program, you will build a foundation in microeconomic and macroeconomic theory, statistics, and econometrics, with the opportunity to also study financial management, behavioral economics, the economics of derivatives, and other areas of interest.\nIn financial economics, math isn’t an abstract concept—it’s a pragmatic tool that allows you to dissect market behaviors, identifying trends and quantifying risk. These skills are at the foundation of strategic financial decision-making in a world where data defines success.\nEconometric tools empower you to unravel the intricate relationships between economic factors and financial outcomes. Proficiency in econometrics allows you to model market behaviors, forecast trends, and assess the impact of policies on financial landscapes.\nEmpirical market analysis equips you to decode financial complexities with real-world data. It’s not just theory–it’s practical prowess. By dissecting historical market data, you uncover patterns, assess asset performance, and discern market trends.\nPursuing an MS in Financial Economics positions you for accelerated career growth, as this specialized knowledge is in high demand across sectors. As global markets become increasingly complex, adeptness in quantitative skills, econometric tools, and empirical analysis will be ever more highly valued.\nFinancial economists may gravitate toward sub-specializations or areas of interest based on their career goals. Three common areas of interest are:\nGaining expertise in investment analysis allows you to assess asset values, forecast market trends, and make informed investment decisions.

However, JHU’s international students in the United States on an F-1/J-1 Visa are required to purchase the university-sponsored student health benefits plan if they are enrolled with full-time status, defined as taking at least three courses per semester. Learn more about student health insurance.\nCourse Fees\nIn addition to tuition, some courses will require field trip, laboratory, technology, and thesis fees. These fees, specified in the Course Schedule for each semester/term, are payable at the same time as the regular tuition charges and are non-refundable.\nBilling Statement\nAll fees for each course will be itemized on your statement and listed separately from tuition. If you receive financial assistance, please check with your sponsor regarding reimbursement of tuition and fees. Please note that all fees are non-refundable. Full course tuition is due at the time of registration. All other fees are payable as noted below.\nTechnology Fee\nAll fully online and blended courses in AAP require an additional technology fee. This fee applies to all students registered in online classes, and it is not refundable.\nContinuation Courses Fee\nStudents who are in a thesis course and do not finish the thesis in the semester in which they enrolled for it must pay a continuation-of-enrollment fee of $500 for each subsequent semester/term until a final grade has been submitted. Students submit a registration form with payment to the Enrollment Office. This fee also allows students to continue using university facilities such as libraries, and the Johns Hopkins Enterprise Directory (JHED). Learn more about the particulars around this fee.\nLate Registration Fee\n\n\nThe Late Registration period is defined as the seven days prior to the start of classes and requires a $150 fee. Late registration does not apply for new students who were accepted for that term.\n\n\n\nCheck the Academic Calendar for late registration deadlines.\nThe Advanced Academic Programs Office of Enrollment Services is located at 555 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, D.C. 20001\nWe are open Monday through Thursday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. (6:30 p.m. during an open registration period) and Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. If you require registration assistance, please contact us.\nPlease note: New students registering for their first semester are exempt from this policy.\nGraduation Fee\nEvery graduate needs to pay the graduation fee, regardless of whether or not they plan to attend the ceremony. The graduation fee is $100 and is payable upon receipt of a bill from the Student Accounts office. Student Accounts sends this bill in October to students who completed degree requirements during the summer term; in March to those who completed requirements in the Fall, and in April to Spring graduates.\nRefund Policy\nStudents may elect to withdraw from one or more course(s) for a variety of reasons. Refunds are made in accordance with the Refund Schedule.\nSite Menu\nAudience Menu\nSearch\nEnter keyword\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter keyword...\n\n\n\nSubmit\n[GRID_TABLE]\nApplications Now Open\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTake the next step and apply for JHU’s upcoming Fall, Spring, or Summer Terms.\nApplications Now Open\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTake the next step and apply for JHU’s upcoming Fall, Spring, or Summer Terms.\nApplications Now Open\nTake the next step and apply for JHU’s upcoming Fall, Spring, or Summer Terms.",

You will identify a research topic, create a formal proposal based on the Thesis Guidelines, and have the proposal reviewed and approved by the Thesis Research Committee. Additionally, you will work closely with the Program Director and your Thesis Mentor as you progress your project.\nStudents may undertake their own research project as an 11th program course for three additional credits at full tuition. Prior to proposing a project, interested students must have clearly identified a research topic, and submit a formal proposal for review and approval to the Thesis Research Committee, to be received no later than two months prior to the beginning of the term in which the student plans to enroll in the course. The proposal must follow the Applied Economics Thesis Guidelines, which can be obtained by contacting the Program Director.\nThe committee will help identify a mentor who is familiar with their prospective inquiry, and is willing to provide guidance and oversee the project. The mentor must be faculty teaching at the Johns Hopkins University, but the availability of a mentor cannot be guaranteed. Students must meet with the mentor periodically for discussion of the project's progress, on-site or on-line, and must complete a research paper, to be approved by the mentor and the Committee.\nEnrollment of the student is undertaken by the Program Director. Candidates must plan on using two semesters to successfully complete Thesis.\nPrerequisites: All four Core courses and Microeconometrics or Macroeconometrics, and one or more Applied Economics courses in the substantive area of the proposed research, plus a strong academic record (at least B+ average) in at least eight program courses, are absolute minima.\nStudents should be aware of state-specific information for online programs. For more information, please contact an admissions representative.\n[GRID_TABLE]\nApplications Now Open\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTake the next step and apply for JHU’s upcoming Fall, Spring, or Summer Terms.\nApplications Now Open\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTake the next step and apply for JHU’s upcoming Fall, Spring, or Summer Terms.\nApplications Now Open\nTake the next step and apply for JHU’s upcoming Fall, Spring, or Summer Terms.\nMS in Financial Economics Courses and Degree Details\nThe Master of Science in Financial Economics degree is composed of 4 Required Core Courses, 3-5 Customizable Core Courses, and 1-3 Elective Courses.

The course will present the basic principles of Bayesian inference, Bayesian Analysis of the linear regression model and extensions of the regression model, and the numerical methods used for Bayesian implementation. Modern Bayesian econometrics relies heavily on numerical simulation methods and computational algorithms. With the advancement of computing power and the advent of new simulation methods, simulation based Bayesian methods have become increasingly popular in practice with a large and growing number of applications. A significant part of the course will be devoted to explaining and demonstrating how numerical Bayesian methods, particularly, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, such as the Gibbs sampling and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, can be applied to estimate various interesting models in economics and finance. Students will develop practical experience with posterior simulation through hands on computer exercises involving computer programming.
