Additionally, the program has strengthened my ability to develop and commercialize innovation, positioning me to make a greater impact as I advance in my career.”\nEvelyn Ng, MBA 2024\nGroup Manager Materials and Innovation at Callidus Group\n\"After finishing my Bachelor of Science degree with Honours, I worked at Princess Margaret Hospital as a Neurophysiology Technologist. I then went back to UWA to complete my Master in Business Administration and moved into career in management consulting with Ernst and Young. I’ve since relocated to Canberra.\"\n\"My passion is health care. If I could make a difference in the world it would be to improve healthcare and mentoring our future young leaders in how they can make a difference in the world.\"\n\"The most interesting aspect in my career are the people through my work in consulting. I’ve had the unique opportunity to work in every State and Territory.\"\nTomy Hwang\nEY Management Consultant\nBachelor of Science, 2010\nMaster in Business Administration, 2015\nAdelaide Bevilaqua\nBachelor of Science, Conservation Biology and Management with honours, UWA\nAssociate Principal Marine Ecologist , BMT Commercial Australia\n\nPlease tell us about your career to date.  \nI graduated from the University of Western Australia with a BSc (Hons) in Conservation Biology and Management in 2009, at which point I was already working on a casual basis for Oceanica (now BMT Commercial Australia), as a laboratory assistant. Shortly after graduation I was offered a full-time position and have been with the company ever since. As a junior consultant I was trained as a commercial diver and led marine monitoring programs throughout Western Australia. Over the last decade, I have gained experience managing and implementing small to large coastal and offshore marine infrastructure projects in the energy, resources, ports and harbours sectors. Specific technical and project experience includes provision of State and Federal regulatory approvals advice, feasibility and environmental impact assessments, operational compliance monitoring, environmental audits and scope development. \n\nWhy did you choose UWA to do your MBA? \nI completed my undergrad at UWA and so I am probably biased. UWA does offer very flexible options for completing the MBA program but I was also interested in the access to premier guest speakers and social networking opportunities. \n\nWhat would be your advice to someone considering doing a UWA MBA?\nThere are several people in my office interested in completing an MBA. My advice is to enrol, it is by far the hardest part of the degree. You can always defer, but once you enrol you start to receive information and get a feel for the degree structure, and it just isn't as daunting anymore. Also, go to the information nights and ask questions. Everyone has similar apprehensions about starting post-graduate studies, which is refreshing.\nMatthew Clark-Massera\nBachelor of Electrical/Electronic Engineering, UWA\nOperations Manager, Digital Matter Pty Ltd \n \nPlease tell us about your career to date.  \nI joined Digital Matter (a GPS device manufacturer) in 2017 after completing my undergraduate at UWA. I began in the role of Technical Support Engineer, assisting clients with our products. Over my time, this role has grown to also include inventory management, becoming involved in the finance, as well as managing firmware, software and other engineering teams.\n \nWhy did you choose UWA to do your MBA?\nI thoroughly enjoyed my undergraduate experience and UWA and everything it had to offer – especially the university experience outside of the coursework. Coming back to UWA was natural, but also I believe UWA has a well regarded program internationally, so was a strong choice.\n \nWhat has been the most rewarding aspects of the UWA MBA so far? \nThe highly engaging workshops and seminars. These have helped me learn quickly and broadened my horizons. I am already applying new knowledge to my day-to-day life and work, half-way through my first unit! I have a fresh interest in business topics. As an engineer this is not something I thought I would enjoy quite as much as I have been – but the course content and delivery really makes it great fun to learn!\n• First Name\n• Family Name\n• Email\n• Remember me\n• By clicking on Sign up you agree to the Terms of Use\nSign up\n• Email Address\n• Recover your password\n• Email or Student ID\n• Password\n• Remember me\n• Log in\n• Help\nForgot password?\n• Enquire\n• Apply\n• Mining Leaders Scholarship\n• MBA Indigenous Scholarship\n• passport (and visa if necessary)\n• birth certificate\n• Australian Citizenship certificate\n• Original academic transcripts (unless previously from UWA)\n• Proof of academic English language skills\n• A current curriculum vitae (CV) outlining a minimum of three years of professional work experience from completion of your bachelor's degree and including two referee names and contact details\n• Available\n• Perth (Crawley campus)\n• Full-time\n• Part-time\n• On-campus\n• Trimester 1, 2, 3\n• The estimated time commitment is 12 hours per unit per week which includes contact hours, personal study and examinations.\n• Postgraduate\n• 42520\n• 046894K\n• Available\n• Perth (Crawley campus)\n• Full-time\n• Part-time\n• On-campus\n• Trimester 1, 2, 3\n• Postgraduate\n• 42520\n• 046894K\n• 16 months\n• Master of Business Administration Flexible\n• Trimester 2, 2025\n• Trimester 3, 2025\n• Trimester 1, 2026\n• T2: Open now\n• T3: Open now\n• T1: Open now\n• T2: 21 April 2025\n• T3: 4 August 2025\n• T1: 5 January 2026\n• An MBA from UWA provides access to a substantial peer network and alumni network of Perth’s business leaders and high-potential future leaders.\n• An MBA from UWA equips you with broadened management skill-sets that helps to both ‘future-proof’ your career journey and open up new career opportunities.\n• Learn from a world-class School and industry practitioners as to what ‘works’ at senior decision-making level in business.\n• Learn vital skills in finance, organisation, marketing, economics and leadership to assist your managerial career development and potential.\n• ACCT5602 Accounting  (6)\n• ECON5503 Economic Management and Strategy  (6)\n• FINA5530 Managerial Finance  (6)\n• MGMT5501 Organisational Behaviour  (6)\n• MGMT5513 Data Driven Decision Making  (6)\n• MGMT5700 Strategic Management  (6)\n• MKTG5550 Marketing Principles  (6)\n• ECON5504 Global Energy and Mineral Markets  (6)\n• FINA5590 Blockchain and Technologies for Digital Finance  (6)\n• FINA5601 Valuation and Risk Analysis for Resource Companies  (6)\n• FINA5602 Strategic Corporate Finance  (6)\n• FINA5603 Mergers and Acquisitions  (6)\n• MGMT5505 International Management  (6)\n• MGMT5512 Leadership in Maintenance  (6)\n• MGMT5514 Demonstrating Social Impact  (6)\n• MGMT5516 Social Impact: Entrepreneurs and Social Innovation  (6)\n• MGMT5517 Leadership for Social Impact  (6)\n• MGMT5518 Social Investment and Philanthropy  (6)\n• MGMT5519 Ethical Leadership in Contemporary Organisations  (6)\n• MGMT5521 Operations and Strategic Supply Chain Management  (6)\n• MGMT5523 Becoming a Leader: Perspectives on Leadership Development  (6)\n• MGMT5524 Strategic Management of Resource Companies  (6)\n• MGMT5528 Leading Self and Leading Others  (6)\n• MGMT5531 Strategic Management and Innovation in Health  (6)\n• MGMT5555 Executive Decision Making  (6)\n• MGMT5556 The Business of Politics  (6)\n• MGMT5570 Organisational Change and Transformation  (6)\n• MGMT5601 Small Business Management  (6)\n• MGMT5608 Entrepreneurship and Innovation  (6)\n• MGMT5615 Selected Topics in Management  (6)\n• MGMT5616 Advanced Topics in Management  (6)\n• MGMT5618 International Study Program  (6)\n• MGMT5647 Negotiation Behaviour  (6)\n• MGMT5665 Project Management  (6)\n• MGMT5782 Management Case Study  (6)\n• MKTG5603 Management of Technology and Innovation  (6)\n• ECON5504 Global Energy and Mineral Markets\n• MGMT5239 Oil and Gas Sector Management\n• MGMT5240 Project Management in Oil & Gas\n• FINA5601 Valuation and Risk Analysis for Resource Companies\n• MGMT5524 Strategic Management of Resource Companies\n• LAWS5589 Australian Oil and Gas Law\n• LAWS5532 Oil and Gas Agreements\n• LAWS5111 Corporate Governance for Resources Companies\n• LAWS5521 Climate Change Law and Emissions Trading\n• GENG4410 Fossil to Future – The Transition\n• OCEN4003 Strategic Leadership for the Blue Economy\n[HTML_TABLE]\n | MBA | MBA Flexible*\nDuration | 12 -

Shortly after graduation I was offered a full-time position and have been with the company ever since. As a junior consultant I was trained as a commercial diver and led marine monitoring programs throughout Western Australia. Over the last decade, I have gained experience managing and implementing small to large coastal and offshore marine infrastructure projects in the energy, resources, ports and harbours sectors. Specific technical and project experience includes provision of State and Federal regulatory approvals advice, feasibility and environmental impact assessments, operational compliance monitoring, environmental audits and scope development. \n\nWhy did you choose UWA to do your MBA? \nI completed my undergrad at UWA and so I am probably biased. UWA does offer very flexible options for completing the MBA program but I was also interested in the access to premier guest speakers and social networking opportunities. \n\nWhat would be your advice to someone considering doing a UWA MBA?\nThere are several people in my office interested in completing an MBA. My advice is to enrol, it is by far the hardest part of the degree. You can always defer, but once you enrol you start to receive information and get a feel for the degree structure, and it just isn't as daunting anymore. Also, go to the information nights and ask questions. Everyone has similar apprehensions about starting post-graduate studies, which is refreshing. \n\n\nMatthew Clark-Massera\nBachelor of Electrical/Electronic Engineering, UWA\nOperations Manager, Digital Matter Pty Ltd \n \nPlease tell us about your career to date.  \nI joined Digital Matter (a GPS device manufacturer) in 2017 after completing my undergraduate at UWA. I began in the role of Technical Support Engineer, assisting clients with our products. Over my time, this role has grown to also include inventory management, becoming involved in the finance, as well as managing firmware, software and other engineering teams.\n \nWhy did you choose UWA to do your MBA?\nI thoroughly enjoyed my undergraduate experience and UWA and everything it had to offer – especially the university experience outside of the coursework. Coming back to UWA was natural, but also I believe UWA has a well regarded program internationally, so was a strong choice.\n \nWhat has been the most rewarding aspects of the UWA MBA so far? \nThe highly engaging workshops and seminars. These have helped me learn quickly and broadened my horizons. I am already applying new knowledge to my day-to-day life and work, half-way through my first unit! I have a fresh interest in business topics. As an engineer this is not something I thought I would enjoy quite as much as I have been – but the course content and delivery really makes it great fun to learn!\n[CARD]\nMeet our MBA students",
