By dramatically increasing the availability of scholarships, the initiative reduces barriers and provides boundless possibilities for our most talented students.\nChicago Booth launched the Boundless Scholarship Initiative in 2019 to support our ongoing efforts to recruit the best and brightest students from around the world.\nTo date, the multiyear campaign has raised over $98 million, allowing the school to provide hundreds of scholarships to innovative, driven students. For students, this support not only brings a Booth education within reach but also gives them the freedom to immerse themselves in their studies.\nCentral to this initiative is the Chicago Booth Scholarship Matching Program, which doubles the impact of scholarship support of at least $25,000 each year for five years through a dollar-for-dollar donor match.\nScholarships are crucial to help us attract the most diverse and accomplished candidates and allow them to choose an MBA program on the basis of academics rather than cost. This initiative eases financial constraints so that the most talented students can attend Chicago Booth and reach their full potential.\n“My Booth education has been a powerful resource throughout my career, in my business and in my work in the community. [My husband] Rocco and I want to make sure that more students enjoy the full benefit of a Booth education, and I hope my fellow alumni will seize this opportunity to impact the life of a student.”\n–Roxanne Martino, ’88, Donor\nYour Boundless Scholarship Initiative donation will make Booth’s top-ranked business education more attainable for the next generation of bold thinkers.

What we learned is that we could induce more people to really seriously consider the Chicago approach by offering scholarships.\nVictor Ojeleye:\nWhen I think about the scholarship, it made me feel like I belonged. And I think it sends a great message that not only do they want you to attend, but they want to support you through your experience.\nLisa Baker:\nA lot of your top students are getting into multiple schools. And oftentimes their heart may be in one place, but if the financial pull is pulling them somewhere else, they may not end up at Chicago Booth.\nSruti Balakrishnan:\nOpportunities for scholarships really encourages people to pursue what they're truly interested in, which has changed my life.\nStacey Kole:\nScholarships are particularly powerful in situations where there's real scarcity, where there aren't very many students from a certain part of the world or from a certain prior demographic who we truly want to have in our classrooms.\nLisa Baker:\nCreating leaders is about more than just the classroom experience. It's about the interactions and interpersonal relationships that we develop with each other.\nSruti Balakrishnan:\nI didn't want just a typical MBA Finance 101, Accounting 101, experience. I wanted to explore social entrepreneurship, and I wanted opportunities to network with like-minded students and alumni.\nVictor Ojeleye:\nWe are all here to pursue an MBA because we want to become better leaders and better contributors in the future, so a scholarship means that we're able to focus and really be more tactical in our approach.\nStacey Kole:\nAt Chicago Booth, we've developed a culture of paying it forward. And what that means is that each and every student has an obligation to share wisdom and experience with others. They've internalized that message, particularly the scholarship recipients.\nVictor Ojeleye:\nFinancial contributions to scholarships go beyond the numbers. They go towards developing an individual who will be a future leader.\nStacey Kole:\nSo, when you think about giving a gift, understand the full value of your impact. You're empowering individuals to change not only their lives but the lives of others.\nSruti Balakrishnan:\nI'm very much committed to giving back. And I plan on doing what I can to contribute to the Booth community as much as I can, both while I'm here and later on, when I'm an alum.\nStacey Kole:\nScholarships let the world know that if you have talent and ability, Chicago Booth will invest in you.\nWe’d love to tell you more about the Chicago Booth Boundless Scholarship Initiative.

What we learned is that we could induce more people to really seriously consider the Chicago approach by offering scholarships.\nVictor Ojeleye:\nWhen I think about the scholarship, it made me feel like I belonged. And I think it sends a great message that not only do they want you to attend, but they want to support you through your experience.\nLisa Baker:\nA lot of your top students are getting into multiple schools. And oftentimes their heart may be in one place, but if the financial pull is pulling them somewhere else, they may not end up at Chicago Booth.\nSruti Balakrishnan:\nOpportunities for scholarships really encourages people to pursue what they're truly interested in, which has changed my life.\nStacey Kole:\nScholarships are particularly powerful in situations where there's real scarcity, where there aren't very many students from a certain part of the world or from a certain prior demographic who we truly want to have in our classrooms.\nLisa Baker:\nCreating leaders is about more than just the classroom experience. It's about the interactions and interpersonal relationships that we develop with each other.\nSruti Balakrishnan:\nI didn't want just a typical MBA Finance 101, Accounting 101, experience. I wanted to explore social entrepreneurship, and I wanted opportunities to network with like-minded students and alumni.\nVictor Ojeleye:\nWe are all here to pursue an MBA because we want to become better leaders and better contributors in the future, so a scholarship means that we're able to focus and really be more tactical in our approach.\nStacey Kole:\nAt Chicago Booth, we've developed a culture of paying it forward. And what that means is that each and every student has an obligation to share wisdom and experience with others. They've internalized that message, particularly the scholarship recipients.\nVictor Ojeleye:\nFinancial contributions to scholarships go beyond the numbers. They go towards developing an individual who will be a future leader.\nStacey Kole:\nSo, when you think about giving a gift, understand the full value of your impact. You're empowering individuals to change not only their lives but the lives of others.\nSruti Balakrishnan:\nI'm very much committed to giving back. And I plan on doing what I can to contribute to the Booth community as much as I can, both while I'm here and later on, when I'm an alum.\nStacey Kole:\nScholarships let the world know that if you have talent and ability, Chicago Booth will invest in you.\nVideo Transcript\nStacey Kole:\nA decade ago in Chicago Booth, we thought hard about what it is that makes for a great match between the talents and aspirations of our students and what we have to offer.

Undergraduate Business courses follow the college’s canonical hours and may meet two or three times a week. Regardless of what type of Booth course you are taking, many faculty have a strict attendance policy, and some require attendance at the first session.\nWhere can I get a name tent?\nBooth students use name tents to identify themselves in the classroom. It is recommended that you have one. Graham School students and undergraduates in an undergraduate-only section will have name tents printed and distributed early in the quarter. Name tents are available for purchase at the Booth Business Center, located in the Harper Center (Room 108B). Hours are 8 a.m.–5 p.m. Monday through Friday.

Strict prerequisites are marked “strict” in the Booth course description; all others are recommended (a waiver is not needed).\nUndergraduate Business courses may have strict prerequisites, which will be noted in the online course description. The My.UChicago.edu system will prevent you from self-enrolling if you have not met the strict prerequisite(s).\nDo I need faculty consent to take a Booth course?\nSome faculty do not allow non-Booth students in their MBA courses. The course description in the Booth online course tool will note any such restrictions. Students can also consult the eligible course list, which is updated each quarter and can be found in the \"Enroll in an MBA course\" section of this website.\nA course I'm interested in has a prerequisite.

Describe your relevant experience and skills so the faculty member can determine whether to grant the waiver. Once granted, forward the email to prereq@lists.chicagobooth.edu.\nCan I take an Incomplete grade in a Booth course?\nPossibly. Requests for Incomplete grades must be approved by the instructor, and an Incomplete form must be emailed to the Booth Registrar's Office by Friday, Week 9.\nWhat is the deadline to withdraw from a Booth course?\nFor students in MBA-level courses, the deadline to withdraw without faculty consent is Friday of Week 7. Starting Monday of Week 8, an email showing consent from your professor must accompany any withdrawal request. The final deadline to withdraw is Friday, Week 9.\nFor undergraduates in college-level Booth courses, you must request a W from your advisor and notify the Booth Registrar’s office by the Friday of 9th week or the day before the final project/exam is due, whichever is earlier.

NOTE: The Booth Pass/Fail request deadline includes Undergraduate Business courses and is earlier than the College's deadline.\nHow will I know if my registration request has been processed?\nRegistration requests are collected via an online request form and are processed during Week 1 of the quarter. After submitting your request, you will get an email summary (typically within 6 hours--check your spam folder). This is not a confirmation of enrollment. The Booth Registrar’s Office will send you an email with results after enrollments have been processed, according to the schedules outlined on the website.\nWhy didn't I get an email after I submitted my online poll?\nSince the poll email is sent automatically by the Qualtrics system, it might wind up in your spam folder, so check there first. If you don’t find it, you may have mistyped your email address in the email field. Or you may not have hit the “submit” button at the end of the poll.\nWhen is the deadline to add a Booth course?\nThe last day to add a Booth course—including switching from one section to another—is Friday, Week 2.

After this deadline, no changes to the Pass/Fail grading request may be made.\nHow can I tell if I'm officially enrolled in a Booth course?\nYou will receive an email from the Booth Registrar’s Office with the status of your registration request. If successful, you can view your enrollment(s) on My.UChicago.edu within 24 hours of confirmation.\nCan I be added to a waitlist for a Booth course?\nNo. If a course is closed, you may not register for it unless a seat becomes available at the time your registration is processed. Waitlists are not maintained for non-Booth students.\nCan I pink slip into a Booth course?\nNo. Booth does not use pink slips or consent forms. The only way to be added to a Booth course is to submit a request via the online poll or to self-enroll using My.UChicago.edu for undergraduate-only sections.\nHow can I find out if there are seats left in a section?\nConsult the Seat Availability chart.

If your instructor uses Canvas, the course link will appear in the Courses menu of your Canvas dashboard.\nWhy hasn't my Canvas access activated yet?\nYour access should automatically activate within 24 hours of receiving an enrollment confirmation email from the Booth Registrar's Office. A delay may be because:\nCan I get access to Canvas before I officially register for a Booth course?\nIn some cases, a faculty member may add you to their Canvas site before you are officially registered so you can access course materials. However, being granted access to Canvas does not constitute official enrollment.\nHow do I get access to the Booth intranet?\nUse your CNet ID and password to log into the Booth Intranet.\nHow do I get a Booth ID to access password-protected course materials?\nSome course materials (typically found on faculty websites rather than Canvas) are only available with a Booth ID and password. If you need a Booth ID, you must call the Booth IT HelpDesk so they can verify your identity and assign you a password. You will need to provide your 8-digit Student ID number when you call.

Can I take an Undergradaute Business course?\nYes, but it’s not advisable, especially if you plan on applying to Booth for an MBA. Business Economics courses are college-level courses and can only transfer as electives; they cannot transfer toward degree requirements for the Booth MBA. Also, Business Economics courses take place during the day at the Hyde Park campus, which is less convenient for most GSALB students. Finally, you would still have to pay the full GSALB tuition rate for these college-level courses.

Check Eligibility and Prerequisites\nPrerequisites Overview\nSome faculty members allow non-Booth students, but first you must email them to request permission (this includes Booth Alumni). Check the quarterly list of eligible courses for non-Booth students to see whether the professor allows non-Booth students. If a course is not listed on the eligible course list, then non-Booth students are not allowed to enroll. The eligible course list also contains links to faculty email addresses. Forward permission emails to Prereq@Lists.ChicagoBooth.edu so staff can log them.\nSome faculty members may designate one or more strict prerequisites for their course. Courses with strict prerequisites are indicated on the eligible course PDF above, and also in the online course search tool with the designation \"strict prerequisite\" at the bottom of the course description. If a course has a strict prerequisite, you can’t take the class unless you’ve either taken the required course at Booth or received permission from the professor in the form of a waiver. To get a waiver:\nEmail the faculty member who teaches the course, describe your relevant experience, and ask for a waiver. Faculty emails can be found on the eligible course PDF linked above.\nIf granted, forward the email to prereq@lists.chicagobooth.edu. Our staff will log the waiver and send you a confirmation. You still need to fill out the online request form to request enrollment. A seat will not be held while a waiver request is pending.\nDetails about strict versus recommended prerequisites are available here.\n3. Check Available Seats\nCourses are offered on a space-available basis after Booth students have had first priority for registration. To estimate your chances of getting in to the class of your choice, see our seat availability report. The report isn’t updated in real time, but it’s updated periodically throughout registration.\nVIEW SEAT AVAILABILITY REPORT\n4. Read the Fine Print\nUChicago Undergraduates\nThere are some important differences between Booth courses and college courses. Here are some things to keep in mind.\nChicago Booth Alumni\nBooth alumni may take up to 300 tuition-free course units through the Full-Time MBA, Evening MBA, or Weekend MBA Programs. Tuition is not assessed for these classes, but you are responsible for the costs of course materials.\nRegistration and Grading\nGraduating Students\nWe advise you not to take a Booth course in your graduating quarter unless you don’t need the course to fulfill your degree requirements. Booth faculty are not required to issue provisional or early final grades for graduating students, so it may affect your ability to graduate. For more information, consult the For Graduating Students section of our FAQ.\nSome courses have assignments due on the first day of class. We highly recommend that you complete the assignment even if you’re not sure you’re enrolled.\nFirst-Class-Assignment\n6.

Risen (00:09):\n  We're the oldest PhD program within a business school,  which is pretty extraordinary to think of sort of how long ago the recognition  was there that we wanted to be training not just business leaders in practice,  but to be training the future leaders of academic discipline.\nRay Ball (00:26):\n  So I arrived in 1966. Oh, it was marvelous. The place just  crackled with ideas and open discussion, and I ended up throwing out all the  ideas I came with.\nAnn L. McGill (00:35):\nWhat I especially liked about learning things here is this  is an interdisciplinary school, so you didn't have to dive in a silo. You can  wrap your arms around huge areas.\nMarianne Bertrand (00:46):\n  What is special is that we are part of a business school,  training PhD students across a range of disciplines, not just economics or  finance, which we deploy in the Economics Department, but also students are doing  psychology, operation research.\nRay Ball (00:59):\n  At Chicago, the ideas were the authorities, not the  people, and they were all up for grabs.\nAmir Sufi (01:06):\n  What we're trying to create here is people who produce  knowledge, not just consume it. And that's the real challenge I think of PhD  education.\nAna-Maria Tenekedjieva (01:15):\n  I was never told at any point that, \"Oh, this is not  real finance. This question is too outside of the box.\" On the contrary,  it was always, \"You should do what you want to do, and we're going to  think about placement once the paper is ready.\"\nJane L. Risen (01:32):\n  You don't make any assumptions. You question everything.\nPradeep K. Chintagunta (01:35):\n  It's not enough just to know what other people have done.  It's also important to know what needs to be done next. To be able to do that,  you need to be able to ask questions beyond the questions that have been asked  in the previous literature or in the previous knowledge that's already out  there.\nJeffrey R. Russell (01:53):\n  When you're going to seminars here, or watching my  colleagues talk in the hallways, you'll often see them in what look like very  contentious battles. But really, they're just after, \"What's the right answer?\" When PhD students come here, they are able to sort of bring that into their own  souls, and I think that really pushes them then to sort of be the best  possible researcher that they can.\nAna-Maria Tenekedjieva (02:12):\n  Chicago Booth is known for its quite aggressive  questioning style. I think that we get a little bit of a bad rap. There is a  point to the aggressive questioning, and it is to clarify the idea. In Chicago  Booth the spirit is be tough on the idea, not on the person.\nAmir Sufi (02:30):\n  Throughout the world, we're appreciating more and more how  influential research can be. I think our PhD students going forward will  increasingly be placed in positions, both in scholarship and in government  and in business, where they can have major influence.\nRay Ball (02:48):\n  So the fact that this is the oldest doctoral program in business, that it has been going for 100 years, gives some indication of the  commitment of this school to training people. We still have those same values,  and so it's always going to generate people who change the world, who change  the way we think. I can't tell you at this point how that will happen. That's  exactly the idea. New people come in with new ideas, and they learn how to  implement them in the school, and they change the way we think about the world.  And that's going to keep going.\nSince then, the faculty, alumni, and students of this preeminent PhD program have been driving the evolution of modern research in a wide range of disciplines, from accounting to behavioral science to finance. This research continues to make a lasting, real-world impact on the way scholars, government leaders, and industry professionals think about and conduct business.\nOn May 12, we celebrated the PhD program's centennial milestone and reflect on the tremendous impact PhD faculty, students, and alumni have made on research and business education throughout the decades. In this spirit, we were excited to announce that notable entrepreneur and philanthropist, Ross Stevens, PhD ’96, made a gift of $100 million to our program. Stevens spoke with conference attendees in a conversation moderated by Dean Madhav Rajan during the celebration’s Gala Dinner. Please find the event details below.\nOur 100th anniversary celebration took place on Friday, May 12 and Saturday, May 13, 2023. The centennial celebration included an academic conference with plenary speakers and breakout sessions by discipline, as well as social events. It was a wonderful opportunity for alumni to reconnect with former classmates and Chicago Booth colleagues.

Mitchell, the son of a Civil War veteran, was an Indiana native who grew up on his family’s farm. He taught classes in industrial society and business administration at Booth while pursuing his doctorate. During the program, Hodge wrote Principles of Accounting (1920), coauthored with James O. McKinsey, MA ’19,the future founder of consulting firm McKinsey & Company. Then-dean Leon C. Marshall provided the editor’s preface, describing his vision for the text to become part of a unified and coherent business curriculum, which was lacking at the collegiate level at the time.\n1929 - First Woman PhD\nThe College of Commerce and Administration is the first American business school to grant a PhD in business to a woman, Ursula Batchelder Stone.\nStone devoted her life to teaching future generations of business leaders at George Williams College and improving her community. She served as president of the Hyde Park League of Women Voters and as executive director of the South East Chicago Commission, which sought to preserve Hyde Park.\n1951 - PhD Alumnus Becomes Dean\nJohn Jeuck, AB ’37, MBA ’38, PhD ’49, becomes dean of the business school. He streamlined the school’s curriculum, focused on faculty recruitment, opened a new downtown Chicago campus, and founded the Distinguished Fellows scholarship program for students.\nPhoto: University of Chicago Photographic Archive, [apf1-05432], Special Collections Research Center, University of Chicago Library.\n1960 - Alumnus Establishes CRSP\nProfessor James H. Lorie, PhD ’47, leads the establishment of Chicago Booth’s Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP), a complete and accurate stock database to support financial and economic research. Lorie helped collect and research the accuracy on each piece of stock data, including prices, dividends, and rates of return on all stocks listed and trading on the New York Stock Exchange since 1929. The project allowed the average rate of return to be measured for the first time. Today, nearly 500 academic institutions in 35 countries rely on CRSP data to support academic research and classroom instruction.\n1962 - Accounting Research Center Established\nThe PhD Program establishes the Institute of Professional Accounting, today called the Accounting Research Center, to advance accounting research and teaching among PhD students and faculty, who have played a central role in the evolution of modern accounting research. The Journal of Accounting Research was established the following year, and remains a leading academic business journal today.\n1965 - Birth of Efficient Markets Theory\nPhD alumnus and professor Eugene Fama, MBA ’63, PhD ’64, publishes the now-renowned efficient markets theory in an article, “The Behavior of Stock-Market Prices,” in the Journal of Business.\nFama defined a market to be efficient if prices incorporate all available information about future values. His theory led to efficient markets becoming the organizing principle for decades of empirical work in financial economics.\n1966 - Building Community\nEight candidates in the incoming class of 24 are international students, an all-time high. To build community, the program increases the variety of student activities available, with plans to add a weekly coffee chat with faculty, seminars on teaching and communication, and a spring dinner honoring fellowship winners.\n1971 - Homegrown Academics\nBy 1971, 11 of the school’s PhD alumni are senior faculty at the school.\n1973 - Black-Scholes Model\nA month after the Chicago Board Options Exchange introduced trade in options, finance professors Fischer Black and Myron Scholes, MBA ’64, PhD ’70, publish the Black-Scholes model, the first sound mathematical formula for valuing stock options, in the Journal of Political Economy. Traders on the exchange floor adopt the model almost immediately.\n1977 - Yntema Wins Alumni AwardTheodore O. Yntema, AM ’25, PhD ’29, wins the Distinguished Alumni Award.\nFrom the 1920s through the 1940s, Yntema was a pioneer contributor to the school of business and the field of quantitative analysis and finance. His career furnished a strong bond between the theoretical and analytical facets of finance and its application to modern corporate management.\nPhoto: University of Chicago Photographic Archive, [apf1-05432], Special Collections Research Center, University of Chicago Library.\n1983 - Second PhD Alumnus Named Dean\nJohn P. “Jack” Gould, MBA ’63, PhD ’66, becomes dean of Chicago Booth. He launched Booth’s first capital campaign, led the school’s international expansion to Europe, and paved the way for Gleacher Center in downtown Chicago.\n\nPhoto: University of Chicago Photographic Archive, [apf1-07749], Special Collections Research Center, University of Chicago Library.\n1986 - Sprinkel Wins Alumni Award\nBeryl W. Sprinkel, MBA ’48, PhD ’52, wins the Distinguished Alumni Award.\n\nSprinkel served as executive vice president and economist for the Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago for 28 years. He later brought his expertise in business and academia to government as undersecretary of the Treasury for monetary affairs and chairman of the US Council of Economic Advisers.\n1994 - Pichler Wins Alumni Award\nAlumnus Joseph A. Pichler, MBA ’63, PhD ’66, wins the school’s Distinguished Alumni Award.\n\nWhile president of the Kroger Company, Pichler was instrumental in saving Kroger from a hostile buyout in 1989. Because of his efforts, the company was able to retain its shareholders and keep all of its employees in place. Pichler was later named chairman and CEO of the company. Prior to joining Kroger, Pichler served as a faculty member and then dean of the University of Kansas School of Business.\n1997 - Scholes Wins Nobel\nAlumnus and professor Myron Scholes, MBA ’64, PhD ’70, wins the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for helping develop the formula used to value stock options, the Black-Scholes model.\n2004 - Harper Center Opens\nThe Charles M. Harper Center opens.

At school, Stone specialized in consumer economics, arming her with the knowledge and skills to launch a consulting firm with close friend Rachel Marshall Goetz. Companies all across Chicago hired Stone's firm to analyze data to advance their business strategies.\n\nStone went on to fight for women's suffrage and her community's safety. As president of the Hyde Park League of Women Voters, she galvanized women to improve their local government. As executive director of the Southeast Chicago Commission to Preserve Hyde Park, she helped revitalize the neighborhood with new housing and businesses.\n\nStone later passed on her wisdom and experience to future generations as a professor at George Williams College in Hyde Park. She served as an inspiration to her students, who frequently wrote her letters of gratitude. A colleague once wrote, \"Stone feels a successful dreaming towards a better world must be rooted in knowledge of the past, love for the scientific method, and a large sense of patience. She wants students to learn to trust themselves.

Risen (00:09):\n  We're the oldest PhD program within a business school,  which is pretty extraordinary to think of sort of how long ago the recognition  was there that we wanted to be training not just business leaders in practice,  but to be training the future leaders of academic discipline.\nRay Ball (00:26):\n  So I arrived in 1966. Oh, it was marvelous. The place just  crackled with ideas and open discussion, and I ended up throwing out all the  ideas I came with.\n\nAnn L. McGill (00:35):\nWhat I especially liked about learning things here is this  is an interdisciplinary school, so you didn't have to dive in a silo. You can  wrap your arms around huge areas.\n\nMarianne Bertrand (00:46):\n  What is special is that we are part of a business school,  training PhD students across a range of disciplines, not just economics or  finance, which we deploy in the Economics Department, but also students are doing  psychology, operation research.\n\nRay Ball (00:59):\n  At Chicago, the ideas were the authorities, not the  people, and they were all up for grabs.\nAmir Sufi (01:06):\n  What we're trying to create here is people who produce  knowledge, not just consume it. And that's the real challenge I think of PhD  education.\nAna-Maria Tenekedjieva (01:15):\n  I was never told at any point that, \"Oh, this is not  real finance. This question is too outside of the box.\" On the contrary,  it was always, \"You should do what you want to do, and we're going to  think about placement once the paper is ready.\"\nJane L. Risen (01:32):\n  You don't make any assumptions. You question everything.\nPradeep K. Chintagunta (01:35):\n  It's not enough just to know what other people have done.  It's also important to know what needs to be done next. To be able to do that,  you need to be able to ask questions beyond the questions that have been asked  in the previous literature or in the previous knowledge that's already out  there.\nJeffrey R. Russell (01:53):\n  When you're going to seminars here, or watching my  colleagues talk in the hallways, you'll often see them in what look like very  contentious battles. But really, they're just after, \"What's the right answer?\" When PhD students come here, they are able to sort of bring that into their own  souls, and I think that really pushes them then to sort of be the best  possible researcher that they can.\nAna-Maria Tenekedjieva (02:12):\n  Chicago Booth is known for its quite aggressive  questioning style. I think that we get a little bit of a bad rap. There is a  point to the aggressive questioning, and it is to clarify the idea. In Chicago  Booth the spirit is be tough on the idea, not on the person.\nAmir Sufi (02:30):\n  Throughout the world, we're appreciating more and more how  influential research can be. I think our PhD students going forward will  increasingly be placed in positions, both in scholarship and in government  and in business, where they can have major influence.\nRay Ball (02:48):\n  So the fact that this is the oldest doctoral program in business, that it has been going for 100 years, gives some indication of the  commitment of this school to training people. We still have those same values,  and so it's always going to generate people who change the world, who change  the way we think. I can't tell you at this point how that will happen. That's  exactly the idea. New people come in with new ideas, and they learn how to  implement them in the school, and they change the way we think about the world.  And that's going to keep going.\nBaris Ata (00:00):\n  When I came here, it felt like, \"Now I'm in the major  leagues.\" I realized how high the standards are.\n\nJane L.

Griffin Department of Economics and to the doctoral program at Chicago Booth, but interested parties need only apply to one or the other program. Students may enter the joint program at the beginning of their doctoral studies. Those seeking admission to the joint program should apply online to either the PhD program in the Department of Economics or Chicago Booth. The GRE is required for all applicants to this program.\nStudents enrolled in doctoral studies in either the Department of Economics or Chicago Booth may apply to the joint program at any time within their first two years in residence. Such students will still have to meet all of the requirements of both programs.\nEnrollment and financial aid throughout a student's matriculation in the joint program will be administered by either the Division of the Social Sciences or Chicago Booth, as arranged by the two units. This designation will be for administrative purposes only and will not have programmatic implications. If a student's interests change, the director of the Stevens Program at Chicago Booth and the dean of students for the social sciences will facilitate transfers out of the joint program and into the doctoral program in economics or business.\nJoint Program in Psychology and Business\nStudents interested in applying to the Joint Program in Psychology and Business through Chicago Booth should apply online for admission to the Behavioral Science dissertation area. Once admitted, students seek a faculty research sponsor in the Department of Psychology. After a faculty sponsor in psychology has been identified, admission to the Joint Program is generally automatic. Entry into the Joint Program in Psychology and Business normally occurs during the first year of study. Applicants should state their interest in the joint program as part of the application process so they can be given advice in making the connection to faculty in the Department of Psychology.\nJoint PhD/JD Program\nTo earn the joint PhD/JD degree, you must be admitted to both the Law School and Booth’s Stevens Program. You may apply to both programs at the same time, or you may begin one program and then apply to the other at a later date. Please visit the Law School's website for more information.\nAdmitted students who are called to active duty prior to matriculation will be granted a deferral of admission and Chicago Booth financial aid to the following year. Deferrals will be reviewed/extended on an annual basis.\nThe Stevens Program at Chicago Booth accepts up to three courses in transfer credit from other approved institutions. These credits can only be used toward the coordinated sequence requirement. The Stevens Program does not grant credit for experiential learning or online courses.\nFor details on readmission, taking a leave of absence, resuming studies, academic grievance policies, and add/drop requirements, please see this Guidebook.\nIf you still have questions after reviewing our doctorate in business FAQ, please contact us.

Cohen find that it’s better to be dishonest in some situations.\nThe presence of someone’s voice is a vital component of interpersonal understanding, writes Chicago Booth’s Nicholas Epley.\nJuliana Schroeder, PhD ’15, talks about her research into how people convey their mental capacity to others.\nVideo Transcript\nJuliana Schroeder, ’15: 00:11\nI was always interested in the way that we interact with those around us, and the way that we judge them, and how we make decisions, but I was interested in it from sort of a really broad social science perspective, both psychology and economics, and then, when I came to Chicago Booth, I met Nick Epley right away who's a professor here, and he got me really interested in this specific topic. This is research about how people convey their mental capacity to others. Most people think that if someone can see them, they might appear smarter.\nJuliana Schroeder, ’15: 00:46\nWe don't find any evidence of that. We find that it carries through the voice. We think that being able to hear someone's voice, being able to hear them speak is humanizing in some way. It kind of conveys their mental capacities. We've been looking at what are the paralinguistic cues that mediate the fact, and it seems that variance and pitch is important. There could be boundary conditions to this effect. There might be certain accents that convey less intelligence, so we're looking at the Southern drawl, for example. That is one in particular in the U.S. that seems to be associated with less intelligence.\nJuliana Schroeder, ’15: 01:22\nThere might be other ways of speaking and aspects in someone's speech, like vocal fray, that could convey less intelligence as well. Working with Nick Epley on this project has been a really fantastic experience. He has been so supportive. We would meet every single week and discuss ideas. I feel extremely lucky to be at Chicago Booth. It's been such an incredible place with incredible resources to do research. When I do research, I think about what would be an interesting psychological idea, so how do we perceive others that can have an application in terms of who gets jobs.\nJuliana Schroeder, ’15: 02:01\nBut, it can also have applications in terms of conflict, in terms of humanization, all sorts of different aspects. And so, being able to do basic research here, and having the resources available in this study pool, the funding for that, it's just incredible.\nPhD students interested in psychology and business come to Chicago Booth to research a range of topics, from the jurisprudence of punishment to the impulses behind dehumanization. They go on to careers in academia, industry, and beyond.\nCurrent Students in Psychology and Business\nSee a list of the current students in our Behavioral Science PhD Program.\nCurrent Students in Sociology and Business\nJacy Anthis\nThe Stevens Doctoral Program at Chicago Booth is a full-time program. Students generally complete the majority of coursework and examination requirements within the first two years of studies and begin work on their dissertation during the third year. In addition to coursework, students are required to meet the divisional teaching requirement by completing a total of 5 teaching assistantships, typically in years three and four.\n\nFor details, see General Examination Requirements by Area in the Stevens Program Guidebook below.\nDownload the 2024-25 Guidebook!\nTo apply to the Joint Program in Psychology and Business through Chicago Booth, apply online for admission to the Behavioral Science dissertation area.

I was doing extremely theoretical research and I was always interested in doing stuff which are more related to the real world, which led me to join Chicago econ and then the Joint Financial Economics Program at Chicago Booth.\nMaryam Farboodi, ’14: 00:29\nThe faculty really helped me focus my research on issues that are relevant to the current financial climate. A lot of current policy focuses on how financial institutions intermediate for each other and that has been the focus of my research. The faculty at Chicago Booth challenged me in making sure that the insight is applicable to the current financial sector.\nMaryam Farboodi, ’14: 00:52\nWhat is really, really special about Booth is the really close interaction between the faculty here and the econ department. Chicago Booth, in particular the joint program, is the best place you can be in. It provides an environment where you can interact with people who are extremely deep in both finance and economics and not lose track of important issues. Chicago Booth and Econ has really being like home to me. That's the feeling that any student can get if they really engage themselves with faculty.\nStudents in Chicago Booth’s Joint Program in Financial Economics focus their PhD research on a vast array of issues, from state-government borrowing costs to wealth inequality to climate policy.

See our FAQ below for answers to some of the questions we hear most often. If you don’t see your question listed here, please email us.\nAbout the Program\nApplication Process\nFinancial Aid\nVisiting Campus\nIs the Master in Management Program at Booth a new program?\nYes. Our first cohort of students will begin taking classes in the fall of 2024.\nIs the Master in Management STEM eligible?\nThe Master in Management is designated STEM-eligible for Optional Practical Training (OPT) purposes. International graduates on F-1 student visas who earn a Chicago Booth masters degree may be eligible to apply for an additional 24 months of training through work experience.\nHow is the Master in Management Program different from Booth’s MBA Programs?\nThe Master in Management Program is designed for recent college graduates who did not major in business, are interested in exploring business, and are at the very beginning of their professional careers. Booth’s MBA Programs are for those who have already gained substantive, yearslong professional experience after college graduation and are looking to take a significant step forward in their professional career by developing the skills necessary to lead with confidence and put bold ideas into action.\nHow should I choose between the MBA and the MiM Program?\nIf you’re looking for the next step in your career, a Booth MBA may be right for you. If you’re looking to jump-start your career and improve your knowledge of business fundamentals, a Booth Master in Management degree may be right for you.\nHow long is the program?\nThe program duration is 10 months.\nWhat are the areas of specialization in the Master in Management Program, and why is the program structured this way?\nAs a part of their educational experience, Master in Management students will select an area of specialization. There are five from which to choose: Analytics, Entrepreneurship, Finance, Marketing, or Strategic Management. Each area of specialization consists of four courses chosen from a specified subset of courses offered in the MBA program. Every student will choose a specialization.\nThis offering is unique among similar programs in the United States. Our program is designed consistent with our belief that, even in a one‐year program, students should have a great deal of choice in how they meet their specific academic interests and career objectives.\nWhere are Master in Management classes held?\nClasses will be held at both the Charles M. Harper Center, in Hyde Park, and at the Gleacher Center, which is located in downtown Chicago.\nHow much does the program cost?\nWhile tuition will be made available in April of 2024, we estimate tuition to be between $65,000–$67,000. Please reference the estimated graduate cost of attendance to get an idea of what the Master in Management will cost excluding tuition and Booth-related fees.\nDo I get to take classes with MBA students?\nMaster in Management students take a combination of courses. The program begins with five cohorted (MiM students only) classes covering the foundational knowledge of business. Students then choose their elective courses from a large variety of MBA courses, and MiM students may take these courses with MBA students.\nWhich classes are cohorted?\nAll of the five core courses in the program are cohorted. Those five courses are:\nCan I apply the credits earned in the MiM toward a future MBA?\nYes. MiM graduates will be able to apply to the Accelerated MBA program and pursue the degree in either a Full-Time or Part-Time format.\nWhat are the minimum requirements to apply to the program?\nThe program is open to recent college graduates with a non-business major, who will have finished their undergraduate degree no more than two years before starting the Master in Management Program. Undergraduate business majors and those who completed their undergraduate degree more than two years ago are not eligible to apply. For more information about the requirements for admission, visit Admissions.\nI am required to submit a GMAT or GRE test score?\nAll applicants are required to submit a valid GMAT or GRE test score, unless they qualify for a test waiver.\nFor all other applicants, the GRE or GMAT is required.\nAre there certain undergraduate majors that are ineligible for this program?\nYes. Business majors are ineligible. For more information about which specific majors we consider business-related, please visit our Admissions page. You may also email us if you have any questions about your eligibility for our program.\nHow do I know if my application is complete?\nWe will notify you via email if anything is missing from your application. This includes test scores, letters of recommendation, transcripts, and the application fee. If your application is incomplete, we will give you a deadline for submitting the additional materials.\nWhy am I having technical difficulties applying to the program?\nIf you are experiencing technical difficulties with your application, we first suggest switching your internet browser. You may also try accessing your application on a home internet network versus a work network. If that does not resolve your issue, please contact us.\nWhat if I miss the application deadline?\nWe have four rounds of applications. Your application must be submitted by 11:59 p.m. CT on the day of the deadline in order to be considered for a particular application round. Applications submitted after a deadline will automatically be considered in the next round, provided that all required materials are included with the application.\nCan I update my application or test scores after submitting?\nIf you have retaken the GRE or GMAT and would like to share your new test scores with the Admissions Committee, you can self-report your scores directly through your online status page. Additionally, if you have received a promotion or engaged in professional development that would necessitate an updated resume, you can upload one through your online status page.\nPlease note that we begin reviewing applications as soon as the deadline passes, so we cannot guarantee that we will see new information submitted to us and will not reevaluate an application if new materials or test scores have been submitted after it has already been reviewed.\nCan my candidacy for this program be reviewed prior to applying?\nUnfortunately, we do not review candidacy prior to application to our program. Additionally, we cannot provide postapplication feedback. We review applications holistically and evaluate them based on a variety of aspects.\nWhat kind of transcript is needed?\nA scanned, unofficial transcript is needed at the time you apply. We require a copy of both sides of your transcript to be attached to your application at the time of submission. An official transcript will be required only if you are admitted to the Master in Management  Program.\nWhat is an unofficial transcript?\nAny transcript that is not in an official, sealed envelope from your registrar is unofficial. Additionally, any transcript that is scanned, copied, faxed, emailed, or sent directly from the applicant is considered unofficial.\nI’m in my final year of undergraduate study. How should I report my transcripts?\nYou need to provide unofficial copies of your transcripts from the beginning of your studies up to the time you submit your application. If you receive an offer of admission, it will be contingent upon submitting your degree certificate and degree-granting official transcripts in time for orientation activities.\nWhat do I do if my university is outside of the United States and uses a different grading scale?\nOur Admissions Committee is familiar with grading systems around the world and will review your grades within the context that they were awarded. Please do not attempt to convert your grades to the GPA system. You can send your transcripts, as they are, via a scanned JPG or PDF version.\nIf my international transcripts are in English, do I still need to submit a degree certificate?\nYes. Degree certificates are required from all universities attended outside of the United States.\nMy international school issues official transcripts in English. Will you accept these, or do I need to submit them in their original language as well?\nWe require that you submit official transcripts in their official language, as well as an English translation.\nWho should I pick as my recommenders?\nAll applicants must submit two letters of recommendation. One recommender must be familiar with your academic background. To learn more about this, please visit How to Apply.\nIs financial aid available?\nFor information about financial aid, please visit Cost and Financial Aid.\nWhen can I visit campus?\nWe will be releasing more information about this soon.\nCan I meet an admissions representative on campus?\nAdmissions staff will be available to answer your questions in Chicago.

From an industry trek in Latin America to an entire quarter studying business in Australia, we have an international program for you. Here are just a few of the options available to Full-Time and Part-Time MBA students.\nChicago Booth offers many ways to globalize your learning in the classroom and far beyond. Here's a sampling.\nBy bringing business education and international relations together, this joint program prepares you for an internationally focused career.\nLearn how our international programs and study abroad opportunities will expand your horizons and prepare you to succeed.\nGain a broad understanding of today’s global business environment and prepare to lead in an international setting.\nLab courses often take students overseas to work on problems of international scope. For instance, students in our Global Social Impact Practicum travel to India to work on a development project such as the use of bamboo as a clean fuel source. In one recent year, a group of students traveled to Indonesia with professor Jean-Pierre Dubé to explore an emerging market firsthand.\nBeyond the classroom, Industry Treks take Full-Time MBA, Evening MBA, and Weekend MBA students on visits to companies in a specific location or industry. Past treks have included visits to Hong Kong, London, India, Dubai, Shanghai, and Latin America.\nOn campus, student-led groups bring together students with shared interests in specific international locations or issues, ranging from the Middle East and North Africa Group for Full-Time MBA students to the Booth India Club for Evening MBA and Weekend MBA students.\nFull-Time Student-Led Groups Part-Time Student-Led Groups\nIncoming Full-Time MBA students also have the opportunity to participate in 10-day Random Walks to destinations such as Argentina, Thailand, and Egypt. It’s a great way to get to know fellow classmates and immerse yourself in another culture.\nImmerse yourself in another culture and explore how the rest of the world does business. The International Business Exchange Program (IBEP) gives you the opportunity to study abroad at a prestigious business school in important global markets around the world.\nStudents in the Full-Time MBA, Evening MBA, and Weekend MBA Programs can apply to spend a full quarter studying abroad, choosing from 30 partner schools in 20 countries. Knowledge of a foreign language is typically not required, since most of the partner schools provide coursework in English. During full-quarter IBEP, you enroll in courses at a partner school and get involved in campus events and activities.\nWe also offer short-term programs to accommodate the work schedules of Evening and Weekend MBA students. Each short-term program lasts two to three weeks and counts as one full course toward your degree requirements.\nQuestions about studying abroad as a Booth student? Please contact Student Life. As a courtesy to our partner schools, we ask you to direct questions to us until after you are officially nominated to participate in an exchange program.\nFull-Quarter Study Abroad Destinations\nShort-Term Programs\n[HTML_TABLE]\nNECESSARY COOKIES\r\n                                These cookies are essential to enable the services to provide the requested feature, such as remembering you have logged in. | ALWAYS ACTIVE\n | Reject | Accept\nPERFORMANCE AND ANALYTIC COOKIES\r\n                                These cookies are used to collect information on how users interact with Chicago Booth websites allowing us to improve the user experience and optimize our site where needed based on these interactions.

I set up bi-weekly calls with a coach on the Booth team. These sessions gave me the confidence to explore opportunities in areas beyond my professional expertise and consider jobs that could be potential ‘career pivots.’”\n— Atri Sen, EMBA Student, Chicago\nOur Global Career and Leadership Development (GCLD) team oversees the required Leadership Exploration and Development course (LEAD) as well as optional programs designed to help you become a better leader, which in turn will advance your career.\nSpecifically designed for executive-level students, the GCLD team’s offerings combine classroom experiences with skill-building workshops, personalized coaching, curated discussions with alumni, and career support. Our global approach builds your cultural competency and prepares you to adapt your leadership skills to new challenges.\nYou’ll enjoy lifelong access to global industry expertise, individualized coaching, and leadership and career support. All of our EMBA career and leadership programs are tailored to meet the needs of executive‐level professionals with unique aspirations, capabilities, and perspectives.\nLeadership Exploration and Development, or LEAD, is a required course for all Chicago Booth MBA students. Within the Sokolov EMBA Program, LEAD is a series of integrated career and executive-level leadership experiences designed to augment your classroom learning with action and insight skills. Built on the leadership principles articulated by professor Harry L. Davis, LEAD was one of the first experiential MBA leadership development courses at a major business school. Combining workshops, networking opportunities, industry insight discussions, and one-on-one coaching, LEAD helps you build self-awareness as a leader and integrate those insights into an intentional, lifelong process of career-focused leadership development.\nThe LEAD course includes:\nDefine your professional goals and craft a plan to achieve them through one-on-one executive coaching. As an EMBA student, you’ll have access to a talented team of executive coaches located in Chicago, London, and Hong Kong who will help you optimize your leadership and career potential. Topics often discussed include executive presence, self-awareness, networking, interviews, managing internal and external transitions, market awareness, and resume/CV reviews.\nThe Global Executive Connections (GEC) program is an annual event designed for EMBA students to access high-level business leaders in today’s most exciting industries and functions. These executives share their knowledge and experience through candid conversations in hour-long, small group discussions.\nThroughout your Booth experience, the GCLD team will support your career and leadership journey through a variety of co-curricular opportunities that empower you to define your goals, generate new insights, and prepare for lifelong experiential learning. For example:\nThis ongoing program is designed to bring some of Booth’s most successful, eminent alumni to engage one-to-one with students. The Distinguished Executives-in-Residence (DEIRs) share the wealth of knowledge they have acquired over the course of their careers, providing mentoring, guidance, insight, and related support.\nCareer Clinics are monthly workshops designed to boost career agility and help Chicago Booth alumni and students create and achieve rewarding career management goals. Lasting one hour each, the workshops are delivered in a group setting around topics such as executive presence, career pivots, salary negotiation, LinkedIn, and interview techniques.\nThis quarterly series provides a safe space for discussion around challenging issues in leadership. Topics could include failure, accountability, inclusivity, gratitude, and positive psychology.\nIn addition:\nNo matter which of our global campuses you choose, you’ll have lifelong access to a dedicated team of knowledgeable industry experts, advisors, and coaches who will support you at every step of your career journey.

Over 21 months, you’ll build a strong foundation in the fundamental tools of business, apply those tools to timely, real-world business challenges, develop your leadership skills, and integrate key concepts you’ve learned in an experiential capstone course. You’ll graduate with an enduring understanding of the critical functions of running a business. From finance to marketing to operations and strategy, you will strengthen your ability to lead boldly.\nYour MBA courses are rooted in a strong foundation of the fundamental business skills and frameworks that you’ll rely on throughout your career.\nThe rigorous grounding in business fundamentals is complemented by EMBA classes in which you’ll apply the concepts you’ve learned.\nIn the second half of the program, you’ll pursue your specific business interests by choosing four elective courses and one capstone course.\nFinally, you’ll bring together key concepts you’ve learned in a team-based, experiential capstone course.\nCreate an analytical toolkit for success.\nYour first courses as an EMBA student are focused on mastering the fundamentals and building a strong analytical tool kit for success. These courses provide you with the tools you’ll need to unlock insights in the courses that come later in the program, such as competitive strategy, corporate finance, and marketing.\nAnalytical Methods\nThis course covers quantitative tools and techniques that will be used throughout the program, including algebra, calculus, accounting, statistics, probability, and Microsoft Excel. You’ll also cover financial accounting basics and the time value of money. We will incorporate concepts and examples from a wide selection of EMBA courses to illustrate how these tools are used in the program and elsewhere.\nManagerial Psychology\nExplore theories and research in social psychology and build your understanding of concepts such as motivation, social perception, interpersonal influence, communication, commitment, and group decision-making. Through case discussions, group activities, and lectures, you’ll build conceptual frameworks and become a more effective leader.\nFinancial Accounting\nLeverage financial data to make strategic decisions about your organization’s business model, profitability, risk, growth, and value. In this course, you’ll learn fundamental accounting concepts and principles and how to read and analyze financial reports so you can measure and describe a firm’s economic events. Through lectures and case discussions, you’ll examine how accounting principles play out in real-world corporate settings.\nModern business runs on data. In this course, you’ll master the fundamentals of probability and statistics so you can make sense of complex datasets and forecast future events. By analyzing real-world problems in fields such as finance, marketing, economics, politics, and sports, you’ll prepare to leverage data to make better decisions for your firm.\nMicroeconomics\nMaster the basic principles of modern microeconomics and learn to leverage them to make business decisions. You’ll learn to think like an economist: to frame problems in economic terms, propose solutions, and assess the tradeoffs. From consumer demand and pricing strategies to game theory, moral hazard, and government regulation, this course will ground you in the fundamentals and empower you to use economic principles to drive better business decisions.\nAs you gain a thorough grounding in business fundamentals, you will also take courses focused on applying those principles. These courses provide the tools you need to become a better leader—to influence people, ask the right questions, and make better decisions.\nManagerial Decision Making\nMake better decisions through the use of both intuition and analytical tools. This course leverages Nobel Prize–winning research on behavioral decision theory to teach you about the biases that affect decision-making and the mistakes managers make. Through in-class exercises, you’ll learn to make better decisions—and to recognize the limits on your intuitive skills.\nNegotiations\nThis course provides essential insights into the science and art of negotiation to prepare you for effective leadership. Through readings and case studies, you’ll examine the psychological processes underlying negotiations and learn how to avoid biases. Through practical exercises, you’ll practice your skills and build a systematic approach to negotiation. You’ll come out of the course as a sophisticated negotiator.\nLeadership Exploration and Development\nExplore who you are as a leader and build strategies for lifelong learning and growth. In this experiential course, you’ll build critical skills such as teamwork, influencing others, conflict management, interpersonal communication, and making effective presentations. You’ll also gain self-awareness and create a plan to guide your continued development at Booth and beyond.\nCorporate Finance\nBuild your understanding of the basic tools of corporate financial decision-making and the fundamentals of investments. This course will prepare you to evaluate investment opportunities, determine how to finance corporate investments, and compare risks and returns. Combining a theoretical framework with applied analysis, the course covers everything from the term structure of interest rates and derivative security pricing to performance evaluation and market efficiency.\nFinancial Strategy\nHow should a firm determine which projects and operating strategies to pursue? And how should these projects and strategies be financed? Using the case method, this course builds your understanding of funding needs, financing decisions, investment decisions, and how financial decisions affect firm value. You’ll learn simple but powerful models and frameworks to unlock qualitative solutions to pressing problems in business.\nCompetitive Strategy\nApply tools from microeconomics and game theory to the analysis of strategic business decisions. Explore how firms can anticipate and influence their rivals’ competitive behavior, and the impact this has on profitability. Through lectures and class discussions of real-world cases, you’ll study everything from efficient production and dynamic pricing to vertical integration, product design, and platform markets. You’ll gain a robust set of economic tools and the ability to rigorously evaluate firm strategy.\nMarketing Management\nLearn to create value for customers—while capturing value for your company too. In this course, you’ll master the ability to plan and execute effective marketing strategies. Lectures and discussions illuminate key concepts and current research, while case studies give you a chance to apply theories and concepts to real-world situations. You’ll be ready to develop a marketing plan and defend your recommendations.\nPricing Strategies\nHow do you formulate a pricing strategy? Which data and methods should you leverage to make pricing decisions? And who should be in charge of decision-making about pricing? This class prepares you to answer these questions and maximize profitability by aligning pricing decisions with the rest of the marketing value proposition.\nOperations Management\nA deep understanding of operations management is critical to your success in any field, from consulting to entrepreneurship to general management and beyond. In this case-based course, you’ll learn to create and sustain competitive advantage by structuring, managing, and improving a firm’s recurring business processes.\nManagerial Accounting and Analysis\nHow do you use accounting information to make decisions? How do you control your company’s costs and allocate them over time? In this course you’ll learn to leverage accounting data for planning and control, product costing, evaluating performance, and creating incentives. Armed with these essential tools, you’ll add value to organizations ranging from financial and insurance institutions to service organizations and not-for-profits.\nOrganizations and Incentives\nWhat does it mean to be an employee? What type of corporate culture is most effective? How are firms using analytics to improve management and motivate employees? In this course, you’ll apply tools from microeconomics and social psychology to develop a framework for thinking about organizational design, talent management, motivation, and related topics.\nMacroeconomics\nTake a deep dive into economic growth and recessions, unemployment and inflation, and the difference between the short run and the long run. In this course, you’ll explore the aggregate behavior of individuals, households, and firms and discover how the global economy intersects with your business career. You’ll also develop analytical tools to help you analyze national and global economic performance and macroeconomic issues.\nBusiness Analytics\nThis class discusses methods for strategic business decision-making using business analytic tools building on recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI). These tools allow firms to analyze large, detailed data sets and make precise predictions about the effects of their actions on sales and other critical outcomes (KPIs). Key applications include relationship management (CRM), salesforce management, and the role of advertising in business growth, both using traditional media and digital channels. Additionally, we study emerging opportunities from generative AI and large language models like Chat GPT. Finally, we discuss the ethics of using precise customer data and both the societal value and the unintended consequences of new privacy regulations.\nEthics in the Workplace\nThis course draws on a diverse assortment of readings to treat a wide variety of issues involving business ethics. Each class will be divided into two parts, and one topic will be taken up in each half of the class. Topics include: automation, customer service, the social responsibility of business, activist capitalism, the responsibilities of success, power in the workplace, the money motive, the nature of self-interest, the future of capitalism, and the role of lying in business. These issues will be discussed and debated in class and in written responses to the day’s readings.\nNurture and develop your specific business interests. We offer a wide variety of challenging, exciting elective courses for you to choose from.\nIn the second half of the program, you’ll reunite with classmates from Chicago, London, and Hong Kong for two weeks of elective courses in Chicago. Tailor your program to suit your own interests by exploring cutting-edge topics that are new to you, or delving deep into an existing area of interest.\nFollow Focused Areas of Study\nIf you want to focus on a particular area or subject, it is possible to follow a focused area of study by choosing electives in that area. Focused areas of study are offered in capital markets, corporate finance, entrepreneurship, marketing, strategy, or leadership and management.\nElective offerings vary from year to year, but usually include cutting-edge or advanced topics. Here are just a few of our recent offerings:\nBring it all together with an experience-based capstone course.\nIn your final quarter, you’ll integrate the key concepts and tools that you've gained throughout the program in one of two team-based capstone experiences.

EA scores are valid for five years.\nGMAT/GRE: You may submit an unofficial score during the application process, but official test scores must be sent before you can begin the program.

Here’s a look at the options.\nBooth offers a variety of merit-based scholarships to promising students across its degree programs, thanks to the generosity of its alumni. There is no formal application process for these awards, as all applicants are considered based solely on the information provided in their application. Scholarship decisions are based on factors including academic merit, prospective concentration, the quality of the interview, competitiveness, career goals, and life experiences. Award amounts and notification timelines vary by program, with some recipients being notified at the time of admission and others shortly thereafter. Early application may provide a greater range of scholarship availability.\nChicago Booth is delighted to participate in the Yellow Ribbon Program, an enhancement of the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008, which allows institutions of higher learning in the United States to fund tuition expenses that exceed the highest public in-state undergraduate tuition rate. Yellow Ribbon awards are not scholarships and are available to all veterans at Chicago Booth who qualify under the Veterans Affairs guidelines. The Yellow Ribbon awards are in addition to other VA programs. You can find the application through the University Registrar.\nThe Edwardson Civic Scholars Program offers a full-tuition scholarship for Evening and Weekend MBA applicants committed to public- or social-sector careers.\nThis one-year program is for students entering their final year of study at Chicago Booth, the Crown Family School, or the Harris School. It brings together an interdisciplinary group of promising and eligible UChicago scholars to gain the education, skills, relationships, and perspectives needed to tackle their communities’ most pressing challenges.\nEvening MBA and Weekend MBA students who are US citizens or permanent residents are eligible to apply for the following loans.\nDirect Unsubsidized Loan\nThe Direct Unsubsidized Loan is a federal student loan available to US citizens and US permanent residents who enroll in at least 200 units each quarter. This loan, which is not credit-based, carries a fixed interest rate and has an annual borrowing limit of $20,500.\nDirect PLUS Loan\nA credit-based federal loan, the Direct PLUS Loan can be used to supplement the Direct Unsubsidized Loan. It is available to US citizens and US permanent residents who enroll in at least 200 units each quarter, and the interest rate is fixed. Students can borrow up to the full cost of attendance (which is set by Booth Financial Aid) minus any other financial assistance.\nPrivate, Credit-Based Alternative Loans\nAll students may apply for private, credit-based alternative loans. Students can borrow up to the full cost of attendance (which is set by Booth Financial Aid) minus any other financial assistance. Private-loan terms are set by the lender.\nAll international students—those who have access to a US cosigner and those who do not—have multiple lending options in the private-student-loan market. More detailed information regarding these loans and programs is available to admitted students.\nLoan Policy\nYou can review the loan policy for Chicago Booth in the loan policy documentation.\nQuestions about the Evening MBA and Weekend MBA Programs?

Here’s how the Part-Time MBA application process takes shape.\nWe review applications on a rolling basis, which means you will receive your admissions decision 4–6 weeks from the date your application is complete. You must submit your application by 11:59 p.m. CDT on the day of the deadline in order to be considered for an application round.\n\nApplications are available to begin Winter, Spring, Summer, and Autumn quarters. Applications are typically available 5 months prior to their respective deadlines. The time in which you submit your application in relation to the deadline has no impact on your admissions decision. Previous and current application timelines are available below to help you understand the application cadence by quarter.\n*LEAD will be completed over the course of two in-person days. Attendance on both dates is mandatory.\nLAUNCH is your mandatory orientation. LAUNCH sessions will be a combination of virtual and in-person sessions over the course of a few weeks. The mandatory in-person date is noted above. The goal is to familiarize you with offices on campus and countless resources to aide you in a successful transition to Booth. The LAUNCH schedule will be finalized a few weeks prior to the first session.\n\nIn addition to completing LAUNCH, new students will complete their required Leadership Exploration and Development (LEAD) course during their first quarter at Booth. LEAD is a two-day experience comprising of six learning modules. Part 1 of LEAD takes place the day after LAUNCH Orientation, and Part 2 takes place at the beginning of the quarter. This course is designed to build the foundation for leadership development, self-awareness and community interaction throughout the duration of your Booth MBA Program.\nReady to get started on your application to the Evening MBA Program or Weekend MBA Program? Please submit the following materials.\nOnline Application\nTo submit the online application, you’ll need to register and create a username and password. The online system includes step-by-step instructions for completing the application and submitting all required materials. You don’t have to complete the application in one sitting, and you may edit your application as often as necessary prior to submission.\nYour application must be submitted prior to 11:59 p.m. CST on the day of the deadline in order to be considered for a particular application round.\nEssay Questions\nWe look forward to learning more about you through your answers to the following questions.\nProfessional Resume\nYour resume should highlight the professional and volunteer activities that make you a good candidate for either the Evening MBA or Weekend MBA Program.\nTwo Letters of Recommendation\nPlease submit letters of recommendation from two individuals who know you well and can offer specific examples of your performance at and contributions to an organization. Avoid choosing recommenders based on their title or status. We are more concerned with content and substance rather than reputation.\nOne letter of recommendation should come from a supervisor. We are looking for objectivity in the letter, and we want to hear from someone who can assess both your strengths and your weaknesses.\nThe other letter can come from another professional contact or from someone who has worked with you in an organization or club, or on a volunteer project. This letter can offer a different perspective on your skill sets outside of your professional environment.\nThe recommendation form is part of the online application. You will be prompted to provide the names and email addresses of your recommenders, and we’ll send them an email directing them to the online form. Chicago Booth does not accept letters of recommendation via mail or fax.\nWe ask recommenders to complete a skills assessment for each applicant and to submit a letter answering the following questions:\nTranscripts\nYour educational record is an important part of your application. You’ll need to submit transcripts from all postsecondary educational institutions from which you earned a degree.\nUnofficial Transcripts\n\nAs part of your application, please submit unofficial scans of your transcripts from every university, college, or graduate institution from which you have received a degree, taking care to submit both sides of every one.\nOfficial Transcripts\n\nUpon accepting our offer of admission, you must submit an official transcript from every university, college, or graduate institution from which you have received a degree. If you received transfer credits, we only need the transfer school transcript if the courses and grades earned do not appear on your degree-granting school’s transcripts.\nOfficial records are defined as original documents issued by the institution and bearing the actual (not photocopied) signature of the registrar and the institutional seal.\nMany schools offer electronic official transcripts, which you are welcome to submit.\nAll records must show:\nIf academic records and diplomas are not issued in English by the institution, you must submit transcripts and degree certificates with an authorized English translation.\nChicago Booth reserves the right to review the academic records of all applicants and determine whether the academic credentials presented from a non-US institution qualify for consideration. All degrees must be from an institution recognized by the country’s department or ministry of education.\nFor more information about transcripts, read our blog post: Application Process FYIs and Tips: Transcripts and the Academic Record Section.\nExecutive Assessment (EA), GMAT, or GRE\nYou can self-report your EA, GMAT, or GRE scores at the time you apply. We also accept the GMAT Focus Edition and shortened GRE.\nWe will not need your official test scores until you have been admitted and have accepted our offer of admission. To make your official test scores available to us, please send your EA or GMAT scores using code H9X-9F-17 for the Evening MBA Program, H9X-9F-83 for the Weekend MBA Program, or your GRE scores using code 8852. Your scores are valid for five years.\nIf you are a University of Chicago current student or graduate you may be eligible for a GMAT/GRE/EA test waiver. Visit our FAQs for more information.\nEnglish Language Exams\nIf English is not your native language, you’ll need to submit proof of English proficiency by taking the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL or enhanced TOEFL iBT) or the International English Language Testing System (IELTS).\nThis requirement can be waived if you:\nPlease note this exemption in the application. For more information, see International Applicants.\nApplication Fee\nThe $175 application fee is due when you submit your application.\nInformation for Reapplicants\nYou are considered a reapplicant if you have submitted an application to any Chicago Booth MBA program within the past two years. If you choose to reapply to any Chicago Booth MBA program (Evening MBA, Weekend MBA, Full-Time MBA, or Executive MBA), you must wait six months from the date you submitted your original application AND apply to a Chicago Booth MBA program that begins in a subsequent quarter to your original application. For example, if you originally applied to the Full-Time MBA Program for the Autumn Quarter and would like to reapply to the Evening MBA Program, you must wait a minimum of six months from your Full-Time MBA application submission date AND apply to the Evening MBA Program for the Winter Quarter (subsequent quarter to the fall quarter) to be considered an eligible reapplicant.\nSuccessful candidates in the reapplication process have demonstrated growth through career progress, academic preparation, or community involvement. In your reapplication, it is strongly recommended that you address the ways you have strengthened your application since you last applied.\nFor your reapplication to be considered complete, you must start a new online application for the quarter for which you are reapplying. In addition to completing new essay questions and the reapplicant essay question, reapplicants must also submit one new letter of recommendation and conduct an additional interview with the Admissions Committee. Please note, interviews are by invitation. We will keep your original application on file for two years, so you will not have to resubmit transcripts and test scores unless there is updated information.\nFor additional information about reapplying, please contact our Booth Admissions at 312.464.8700 or eveningweekend-admissions@chicagobooth.edu.\nThe first step toward a life-changing Booth experience is to apply for admission to our Evening MBA or Weekend MBA Program.\nStart Your Application\nHere’s what to expect after you’ve submitted your application to the Evening MBA Program or the Weekend MBA Program:\nAdmissions Interview\nInterviews are granted on an invitation-only basis. Interview decisions will be released within 3-5 business days after evaluation of a submitted and complete application. You will receive either an Invite to Interview or Deny Without Interview decision. If you are invited to interview, you will receive information about scheduling your interview at that time.\nOur Committee is made up for students, alumni, and staff from the Evening MBA and Weekend MBA Programs.\nAdmissions Decisions\nThe Evening MBA Program matriculates about 280 students per year, and the Weekend MBA Program matriculates about 170 students per year. Admissions decisions are posted in the Application Status section of the online application system, typically four to six weeks after your application is complete.

We also offer merit-based scholarships for MBA students and fellowships to select admitted students, and we encourage you to explore external funding sources, such as foundations, corporations, and associations.\nHere’s an overview of funding options for Full-Time MBA students:\nMerit-Based Scholarships\nBooth offers a variety of merit-based scholarships to promising students across its degree programs, thanks to the generosity of its alumni. There is no formal application process for these awards, as all applicants are considered based solely on the information provided in their application. Scholarship decisions are based on factors including academic merit, prospective concentration, the quality of the interview, competitiveness, career goals, and life experiences. Award amounts and notification timelines vary by program, with some recipients being notified at the time of admission and others shortly thereafter.\nYellow Ribbon ProgramChicago Booth is delighted to participate in the Yellow Ribbon Program, an enhancement of the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008, which allows institutions of higher learning in the United States to fund tuition expenses that exceed the highest public in-state undergraduate tuition rate. Yellow Ribbon awards are not scholarships and are available to all veterans at Chicago Booth who qualify under the VA guidelines. The Yellow Ribbon awards are in addition to other VA programs. You can find the application through the University Registrar. For additional information, please contact Admissions. Read more about our admissions policies for US military personnel here.\nStudent Loans for US Citizens and Permanent Residents\nFull-Time MBA students who are US citizens or US permanent residents have access to federal student loans and/or private student loans.\nPrivate Loans for International Students\nChicago Booth is committed to providing financing opportunities for all students regardless of citizenship status. International students without US cosigners have multiple private-loan options as well. More detailed information regarding these programs is available on the Admitted Student website upon admission to the program.\nThe first step in joining our transformational Full-Time MBA Program is to apply for admission.\nStart Your Application\nDo you have questions about the Full-Time MBA Program cost and financial aid?

You don’t have to complete the application in one sitting, and you may edit your application as often as necessary prior to submission.\nYour application must be submitted prior to 11:59 p.m. CST on the day of the deadline in order to be considered for a particular application round.

This letter can offer a different perspective on your skill sets outside of your professional environment.\nThe recommendation form is part of the online application. You will be prompted to provide the names and email addresses of your recommenders, and we’ll send them an email directing them to the online form.

All degrees must be from an institution recognized by the country’s department or ministry of education.\nGMAT or GRE Scores\nYou can self-report your GMAT or GRE scores at the time you apply. We will allow applicants to submit the GMAT Focus Edition and shortened GRE, as well as the interim at-home or online proctored test scores as made available by GMAC and ETS. We trust the integrity of these testing organizations and should you opt to participate in the at-home testing option, your scores will be reviewed in the same manner as those taken in a traditional testing center, and will continue to be valid for five years.\nWe will not need your official test scores until you have been admitted and have accepted our offer of admission. To make your official test scores available to us, please send your GMAT scores using code H9X-9F-34 or your GRE scores using code 0685. Scores are valid for five years.\nIf you are a University of Chicago current student or graduate you may be eligible for a GMAT/GRE test waiver. Please visit our FAQs for more information.\nTOEFL, IELTS, PTE, or Duolingo Scores (International Applicants Only)\nIf English is not your native language, you will need to submit proof of English proficiency by taking and submitting results from one of the following tests:\nExam score reports are valid for two years and scores will be considered expired if the test was taken more than two years prior to the time of application submission.

Candidates invited to interview will be contacted by the mid-decision date with instructions on how to schedule an interview.\nAdmissions Decisions\nAdmissions decisions are posted in the Application Status section of the online application system.\nDecisions fall into three categories:\nIf you were not admitted (or if you declined an offer of admission), you may reapply in the next academic year. Students who are successful in the reapplication process are competitive in the current year's applicant pool and have demonstrated growth through career progress, academic preparation, community involvement, or self-awareness.\nYou are considered a reapplicant if you submitted an application for admission to Booth's Full-Time MBA Program within the past two academic years. If you applied to the Full-Time MBA Program more than two years ago, or if you applied to another Booth MBA program, please apply as a new applicant.\nApplication\nLetters of Recommendation\nTranscripts and Test Scores\nYou will not have to resubmit official transcripts and test scores unless there is updated information.\nInternational Reapplicants\nIf your TOEFL or IELTS score dates from more than two years prior to the submission date of your application, you must retake the examination.\nQuestions about the Full-Time MBA Program?

Applications must include all required online and mailed-in materials.\nGMAT/GRE Test Requirement\nAll applicants are required to submit a valid GMAT or GRE test score. Chicago Booth does not hold a preference for one exam over another. Both are equally acceptable for the review committee.\nApplicants may qualify for a GMAT/GRE waiver. If you are a current undergraduate student at University of Chicago or have graduated from a UChicago program, you qualify for a test waiver.

You will be prompted to provide the names and email addresses of your recommenders, and we’ll send them an email directing them to the online form. Chicago Booth does not accept letters of recommendation via mail or fax.\nWe ask questions such as: How do the applicant’s performance, potential, background, or personal qualities compare with those of other well-qualified individuals you have encountered in your career? More details on the specifics of our recommendation letter process will be provided soon.\nTranscripts\nYour educational record is an important part of your application for admission. You’ll need to submit transcripts from all postsecondary educational institutions that you have attended.\nAs part of your application, please submit unofficial scans of your transcripts, taking care to submit both sides of each one. Don’t send official transcripts until you receive an offer of admission, because they will not be added to your file.\nUpon admission, you must submit an official transcript from every university, college, or graduate institution that you have attended.\nOfficial records are defined as original documents issued by the institution and bearing the actual (not photocopied) signature of the registrar and the institutional seal.\nAny records issued only once by institutions should be photocopied and certified as official copies, either by school officials or by legal authorities such as embassies or a notary public.

All degrees must be from an institution recognized by the country’s department or ministry of education.\nQuantitative Course Requirement\nWhile there are no specific required classes, it is recommended applicants have taken advanced quantitative coursework and have exposure to coding. Examples include: Linear Algebra, Statistics, Multivariable Calculus, Python, C++.\nTOEFL or IELTS (International Applicants Only)\nIf you’re an international student and English is not your native language, you’ll need to submit proof of English proficiency by taking one of the following exams:\nPlease send your TOEFL scores to Booth using our test code: 1832-02. Your scores are valid for two years. We will allow applicants to submit interim at-home or online proctored test scores as these organizations make them available. We trust the integrity of these testing organizations. Should you opt to participate in the at-home testing option, your scores will be reviewed in the same manner as those taken in a traditional testing center and will continue to be valid for two years.\nYou are exempt from taking an English language proficiency exam if:\nCitizenship status does not qualify for English language test exemption. The Admissions Committee reserves the right to require a score from any applicant if it is deemed necessary to assess a candidate’s English proficiency.\nYou've submitted your application for admission. Now what? Here's what to expect.\nAdmissions Interview\nInterviews are granted on an invitation-only basis after evaluation of a submitted application. Candidates invited to interview will be contacted by the mid-decision date with instructions on how to schedule an interview.\nAdmissions Decisions\nAdmissions decisions are posted in the Application Status section of the online application system.\nDecisions fall into three categories:\nAdmission.
