GAM applicants may also be considered for financial bursaries and Commonwealth Supported Places (CSPs) where available.\nGAM categories include coming from a rural area, being an Indigenous Australian, experiencing financial hardship or personal difficulties, having refugee status, or living with a disability or medical condition. In assessing applications, we look to balance opportunity and your capacity to succeed.\nPrior studies may be credited towards your degree and potentially reduce the duration of your course. This is known as Advanced Standing (also known as credit or recognition of prior learning).\nIf you have an undergraduate degree in business/commerce or a related discipline, or an undergraduate degree in any discipline with appropriate business breadth study or a business minor, you may be awarded up to 50 points of Advanced Standing.\nContact-support \n    How can we help?\n• Arrow-right  \n          #1\n         \n          Business & Economics Australia (Times Higher Ed.)\n• Arrow-right  \n          #18\n         \n          Management studies globally (ShanghaiRanking)\n• Course code:\n         MC-MGMTFIN\n• English language test score requirements\n              Chevron-down\n• If you need to undertake an English language test, you must meet one of the scores* below:\n               \n    IELTS\n   \n    6.5\n   \n  with no band less than 6.0\n    TOEFL\n   \n    79+\n   \n  with writing 21; speaking 18; reading 13; listening 13\n    PEARSON\n   \n    64+\n   \n  with no communicative skill below 60\n    CAMBRIDGE\n   \n    176+\n   \n  with no skill less than 169 \n                *Accepted tests: IELTS (Academic English Only); TOEFL Internet-based test; Pearson Test of English Academic; Cambridge English: Advanced/Certificate of Advanced English (CAE).
