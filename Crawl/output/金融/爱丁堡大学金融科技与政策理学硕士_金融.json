To learn more, view our privacy policy.\nThese cookies are necessary for the website to function normally and cannot be turned off. They are usually set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms. You can block or delete them in your browser settings, but this may affect how the website functions.\nThese cookies allow us to monitor how our websites and services are performing by collecting data about how visitors interact with our sites. The data is collected in a way that does not directly identify anyone.\nThese cookies are set through our site by our advertising partners. They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant ads on other sites. If you disable this setting, you will experience less targeted advertising.\nThese cookies enable us to provide enhanced functionality and personalisation. They may be set by us or by third party providers whose services we have added to our pages.\nOur selection process allows us to select talented students who have the potential to benefit from, and contribute to, the challenging academic experience we offer.\nThe University of Edinburgh is one of the world’s leading research and teaching universities. We are a truly international university and as such, we strive to recruit and develop the world’s most promising students.\nThe programmes taught in our Business School are global in their focus and we aim to ensure that this is reflected in the diversity of the student cohort we admit. Our MSc students represent a wide range of nationalities and backgrounds, typically originating from over 70 different countries. The strong international mix across our student body creates a forum where stimulating and lively discussion can thrive and new global perspectives can be developed.\nWe select students through a highly competitive process, using the information you have provided on your application form to compare you against your peers. We are looking for talented students who best demonstrate that they have the potential to benefit from, and contribute to, the challenging academic experience we offer.\nWhile educational achievement is the most important factor we consider when selecting students, we take other aspects of the application into account, in particular the personal statement, to ensure we have a full understanding of your background and potential.\nWe will be looking for evidence in your personal statement that you have thought carefully about what you can bring to the programme and what impact you feel it will have on your future career. Therefore, please ensure that you address the following issues in your statement to help us select the students who will benefit most from the programme:\nOur overall decision on your application will be based on both academic results as described in the entry requirements section for each programme, and non-academic qualities as outlined above. Applications are given a score in each area and offers are made to those with the highest overall scores.\nSuccessful applicants are likely to have scored very highly in both academic results and non-academic qualities. Unfortunately, due to the level of competition for a limited number of places, many high-quality applicants are unsuccessful.\nOur decision will be based on the following weightings:\nApplications for our postgraduate taught programmes can be submitted at any time during the year, and will be evaluated as they are received.\nApplicants to most of our programmes can expect to receive our decision relatively quickly. However, where programmes are in especially high demand, we will make a small number of offers to the most outstanding candidates on an ongoing basis, but hold the majority of applications until the next published selection deadline when we will offer a proportion of the places available to applicants selected through the competitive process described above.\nFailure to submit all required documents will prevent the Admissions team from considering the applicant for a place on the programme, and may delay the decision on your application beyond the stated deadline.\nApplicants who are not made an offer at a specific selection deadline will either be notified that they have been unsuccessful in securing a place on the programme, or that their application will be carried forward to the next selection deadline for further consideration at that time.\nApplications which are received after our final selection deadline will be considered at our discretion, if there are still places available.\nFor programmes requiring an application fee, applicants should note that in order to be considered in a particular round, the application fee must be paid by the application deadline.\n• Selection criteria\n• Assessment of your application\n• Application timeline\n• Application deadlines\n• What skills, qualities and experiences have prepared you to undertake this programme?\n• What value do you think you can add to the learning community as part of an internationally diverse group?\n• What impact do you hope to make in your future career, and how will this programme contribute to your aspirations?\n• 60% Academic performance\n• 40% Non-academic qualities\n[HTML_TABLE]\nRound | Application Deadline | Decisions By\n1 | 16 October 2024 | 5 December 2024\n2 | 11 December 2024 | 20 February 2025\n3 | 12 February 2025 | 24 April 2025\n4 | 23 April 2025 | 5 June 2025\n5 | 11 June 2025 | 24 July 2025\n[GRID_TABLE]\nThis site uses cookies\n        \nWe use necessary cookies to make our sites work.

These scholarships are funded by the UK Department for International Development (DFID). Interested students must apply to the nominating agency in their Commonwealth country of residence.\nCommonwealth Scholarships\nEligible (Scottish domiciled and EU) applicants who have accepted a postgraduate place on this programme can apply directly to the Student Awards Agency for Scotland (SAAS) for a loan to cover up to £5,500 towards their tuition fees. Prospective students are advised to monitor the SAAS website for further information.\nPostgraduate Tuition Fee Loans\nThe University of Edinburgh offers two tuition fee scholarship schemes for alumni of the University.\nThe University is currently offering a 10% scholarship in postgraduate degree tuition fees for all alumni who have graduated with an undergraduate degree from the University of Edinburgh.\nThe University of Edinburgh offers a 10% scholarship in postgraduate degree tuition fees for all students who have previously matriculated on a \"Visiting Programme\" as an undergraduate student and completed a minimum of one semester of study at the University of Edinburgh.\nTuition fee alumni scholarships\nWe understand that funding your postgraduate studies at Edinburgh might require significant financial investment. That’s why we encourage you to explore all possible funding options, which can include, in order of affordability: scholarships, self-financing, any government-backed loan funding and/or external loan providers.\nA number of options are available for student loan funding, including government-backed ones, for both UK/EU nationals and overseas students. Some further information can be found by visiting the University’s Scholarships and Student Funding Services student loan page.\nProdigy Finance is one example of an external loan provider. Prodigy Finance's model offers loans to international students using a predictive scorecard that considers future potential. Details of their scheme are available on their website. 150 nationalities are eligible and you do not need a UK guarantor or collateral.\nUnlike many government-backed student loan arrangements worldwide, repayments on a Prodigy loan will become due six months after graduation irrespective of employment status (including further studies e.g. progressing to a PhD).\nInformation on loan providers is provided here for information purposes only. All loan applications and loan agreements are the sole responsibility of the individual borrower.\n[GRID_TABLE]\nThis site uses cookies\n        \nWe use necessary cookies to make our sites work.

Some combinations of option courses may not be possible due to scheduling constraints.\n\nCompulsory and elective courses\n\nFull programme details, including all available compulsory and elective courses can be found on the University Degree Programme Tables website.\n\nFinance, Technology and Policy Degree Programme Table \n  \n\n\n \n\n\n  Past dissertations\n\n\n  Find out what topics past students have researched by browsing a selection of dissertation summaries by our postgraduates:\n\nDissertation executive summaries\nSemester 1\n    \nSeptember–December\nCompulsory courses\n    \n\nFinancial Markets and Investment\nFinancial Valuation\nFinTech Infrastructures and Policy\nPrinciples of Data Analytics\nPython Programming\nSemester 2\n    \nJanuary–May\nCompulsory courses\n    \n\nMachine Learning in Financial Services\nFinancial Market Microstructure\n\nOption courses*\n    \nChoose 1 or 2\n    \n\nBlockchain, Governance and Policy\nEconometrics for Risk Analytics\nEconomic Principles of Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies\nEthics of Artificial Intelligence\nInvestment Management\nPattern Recognition in Financial Data\nResponsible Investing \nTechnology Entrepreneurship and Commercialisation\nFinancial Markets Applications of Deep and Reinforcement\n\nPlease Note: Some courses have pre-requisites and some also have co-requisites.\nSummer\n    \nMay–August\nDissertation\n    \nDetails of the Dissertation\n[GRID_TABLE]\nSemester 1\n    \nSeptember–December\nCompulsory courses\n    \n\nFinancial Markets and Investment\nFinancial Valuation\nFinTech Infrastructures and Policy\nPrinciples of Data Analytics\nPython Programming\nSemester 2\n    \nJanuary–May\nCompulsory courses\n    \n\nMachine Learning in Financial Services\nFinancial Market Microstructure\n\nOption courses*\n    \nChoose 1 or 2\n    \n\nBlockchain, Governance and Policy\nEconometrics for Risk Analytics\nEconomic Principles of Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies\nEthics of Artificial Intelligence\nInvestment Management\nPattern Recognition in Financial Data\nResponsible Investing \nTechnology Entrepreneurship and Commercialisation\nFinancial Markets Applications of Deep and Reinforcement\n\nPlease Note: Some courses have pre-requisites and some also have co-requisites.\nSummer\n    \nMay–August\nDissertation\n    \nDetails of the Dissertation\n[GRID_TABLE]\nSemester 1\n    \nSeptember–December\nCompulsory courses\n    \n\nFinancial Markets and Investment\nFinancial Valuation\nFinTech Infrastructures and Policy\nPrinciples of Data Analytics\nPython Programming\n[GRID_TABLE]\nSemester 2\n    \nJanuary–May\nCompulsory courses\n    \n\nMachine Learning in Financial Services\nFinancial Market Microstructure\n\nOption courses*\n    \nChoose 1 or 2\n    \n\nBlockchain, Governance and Policy\nEconometrics for Risk Analytics\nEconomic Principles of Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies\nEthics of Artificial Intelligence\nInvestment Management\nPattern Recognition in Financial Data\nResponsible Investing \nTechnology Entrepreneurship and Commercialisation\nFinancial Markets Applications of Deep and Reinforcement\n\nPlease Note: Some courses have pre-requisites and some also have co-requisites.\n[GRID_TABLE]\nSummer\n    \nMay–August\nDissertation\n    \nDetails of the Dissertation",
