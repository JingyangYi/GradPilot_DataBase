Knowing the costs and what support is available will help you manage your money.\nBefore you apply for university, there are some costs to consider. These include:\nFor some postgraduate coursework programs you'll pay full tuition fees.\nFor postgraduate domestic students, tuition fees are program-based. This means you'll pay the same tuition fee for each course you study in your program during one academic year.\nTuition fees increase annually. The increase is usually fixed 12 months in advance, so you can plan your finances ahead of time.\nYou can pay these fees upfront or, if you're eligible, defer them through a FEE-HELP loan.\nActual fees may be lower or higher depending on the time you take to complete a program. Fees are reviewed annually and may be higher in later years.\nSome programs also have extra costs for things like equipment or field trips. These costs are listed on the program page.\nMost postgraduate programs at UQ have Commonwealth supported places (CSPs) available for eligible students. A CSP is a place that’s partially funded by the Australian Government.\nThe Government subsidises a CSP by paying part of the fee directly to the university. The subsidy amount isn't a loan – you don’t have to pay this amount back.\nBut you’re required to pay the remainder of the fee, known as the 'student contribution amount', for each course you’re enrolled in. You can pay this fee upfront or, if you're eligible, defer it through a HECS-HELP loan.\nStudents do not need to apply separately for a CSP. Eligible students that submit a completed application by the closing date and meet the program’s entry requirements for the chosen program will automatically be considered for a CSP.\nLearn more about eligibility for CSPs\nThe following postgraduate programs are offered to domestic students on a Commonwealth-supported basis in 2025:\nStudent contributions are reviewed annually and may be higher in later years. Postgraduate programs with CSPs vary from year to year.\nYou can view the fee type for each program under the 'Fees and Scholarships' tab of each program page.\nMost Australian universities charge a compulsory Student Services and Amenities Fee (SSAF).\nThe SSAF is used to fund non-academic services for students, including sports and recreation, employment and career advice, child care and food services.\nThe maximum annual fee is $365 for 2025. This fee increases annually. The amount you have to pay will depend on whether you're an internal or external student, and whether you study full-time or part-time.\nYou can pay this fee upfront or, if you're eligible, defer it through an SA-HELP loan.\nLearn more about the Student Services and Amenities Fee (SSAF)\nUnder certain circumstances, you may have to pay additional administrative fees for things like:\nFor a full list of administrative fees, see our fee schedules.\nThere's a range of other costs you may need to pay for, including accommodation, textbooks and transport.

Our living costs guide can help you budget for common expenses.\nLearn more about the cost of living in Brisbane\nTo help you cover your costs, there's a range of financial support available, including:\nThe Higher Education Loan Program (HELP) offers several schemes to support eligible students with the cost of their education. There are 3 main schemes that support postgraduate students:\nIf you're a full-fee paying student, you may be able to use a FEE-HELP loan to cover your tuition fees.\nYou can apply for FEE-HELP if you are:\nWe'll guide you through how to apply for FEE-HELP once you've accepted an offer to study at UQ.\nThere is a limit to the combined amount you can borrow through HELP loans to cover course fees. This includes HECS-HELP loans incurred from 2020 onwards, and all existing and new FEE-HELP loans.\nIf you're accepted in a Commonwealth Supported Place, you can't use FEE-HELP – you'll need to use HECS-HELP instead.\nLearn more about FEE-HELP\nIf you're enrolled in a Commonwealth Supported Place (CSP), you may be able to use a HECS-HELP loan to cover your student contribution amount.\nTo be eligible for HECS-HELP you must be enrolled in a Commonwealth Supported Place, and be:\nWe'll guide you through how to apply for HECS-HELP once you've accepted an offer to study at UQ.\nLearn more about HECS-HELP\nSA-HELP is a loan scheme that helps students pay their Student Services and Amenities Fee.\nIf you're eligible for HECS-HELP or FEE-HELP, you'll usually also be eligible for SA-HELP. You can use SA-HELP even if you don't take out any other HELP loan.\nWe'll guide you through how to apply for SA-HELP once you've accepted an offer to study at UQ.\nLearn more about SA-HELP\nScholarships can help make your university experience more affordable. We offer more scholarships than any other university in Queensland, so it's worth taking some time to research and apply.\nApplication opening and closing dates vary, so search for scholarships as early as possible to ensure you don't miss application deadlines.\nFind a scholarship\nThe Australian Government has approved some masters programs for Centrelink income support to eligible students. Check the program page under ‘Fees and scholarships’ to find out whether the program you're interested in is approved.\nTuition fees for international students are program-based. This means you'll pay the same tuition fee for each course you study in your program during one academic year.\nTo help you estimate your costs, check our indicative fees. The list shows the average annual cost and estimated total cost of tuition fees for full-time study in each of our programs.\nNon-tuition fees are other fees you may need to pay to UQ.

It can help you move into a different industry, advance in your current field, and increase your earning potential.\nWhile these benefits are clear, you might not be sure which master’s degree in business is right for you. Ultimately, the answer to this question will depend on your career goals.

Let’s explore UQ’s postgraduate master’s degree options and help you decide which would best prepare you for your future career.\nUQ’s diverse range of postgraduate business programs will equip you with the practical experience and future-focused capabilities to excel in your chosen career.\nIf you’ve already completed an undergraduate degree in business, you might be wondering:\nLet’s unpack these questions further.\nIf you’ve completed an undergraduate degree in one area of business, you might think it's best to study a postgraduate degree on the same topic. Remaining in the same field for your postgraduate degree affords you the chance to deepen your specialisation.\nHowever, many students take diagonal paths throughout their academic journey. And it may even make more sense to change the study area of your master’s degree if you’re looking to transition between industries or wanting some more variety in your career.\nUQ’s portfolio of postgraduate business programs has been purposely designed to include options suitable for a wide range of professional needs. Some of our business postgraduate programs are designed to suit students who are continuing in the same field (specialist degrees), while others are best for professionals switching to a new field (transition degrees).\nIntended to equip you with the knowledge and capability to change industries, transition master’s degrees are usually in a completely different field of study than your undergraduate degree. Our transition programs are designed to get you up to speed in your new field of study, without requiring previous knowledge or experience.\nFor example, after completing a Bachelor of Business Management, you could study a Master of Commerce to transition into a new industry or advance your expertise with a specialist degree like our Master of Finance and Investment Management.\nWe’d only recommend you complete a master’s degree after previously completing an undergraduate program in the same field if you’ll have the opportunity to diversify and extend your business knowledge and skills in a new area. In many of our business master degree programs, you can do this by specialising in different majors or fields of study.\nWith this useful context in mind, let’s now explore what business master degree programs are available to study at UQ. The answer to these questions will depend on your reason for studying a master’s degree in business.\nThe truth is that the best master’s program for you will be the one that:\nTo help you decide what to study, we’ve categorised each of the business master degree programs available at UQ by the career goals they will help you address. All these programs are also available to be studied as graduate certificates.\nIf you want to challenge yourself intellectually and build mastery by seeking advanced, discipline-specific knowledge to gain a competitive edge in your current role, these are the best business master degree programs for you:\nThis 1.5-year program will provide you with the ability to identify business innovation opportunities and hands-on experience turning ideas into reality, with the opportunity to specialise in 1 of 5 unique fields or create a bespoke program.\nWhile some students use this program to specialise and upskill in the theory of their area of expertise, others use it to transition from one specialty to another (e.g. operations to strategy roles).\nThe 5 fields of study you can specialise in are:\nThis 1-year program will enhance your expertise in the growing finance and funds management sector, accelerating your ability to apply best practice across a wide range of industries.\nDespite being a specialist degree, you don’t need to have a background or experience in finance to apply. Other relevant disciplines that will prepare you for success in this program include accounting, commerce, economics, engineering, mathematics and quantitative methods.\nDrawing on a blend of business, data science and philosophy, this 100% online program is designed to help business professionals future-proof their careers, with opportunities to specialise in analytics leadership, technical application and the responsible use of data.\nDespite being a specialist degree, you don’t need to have a background or experience in business analytics to apply.\nKyara Ramraj enrolled in the program with an undergraduate degree in science and computer engineering.\n“Working in the technology industry, it's important to continuously upskill and learn the latest techniques,” she says.\n“This course teaches the latest concepts and techniques and combines data analytics with business and management. I require this variety to pursue my goals.”\nIf you want to pivot into a new industry or profession, transition into a new career path, or start your own venture, these are the best business master degree programs for you:\nThis 2-year program combines transferable business capabilities, practical experience and specialist knowledge in your choice of up to 2 from 9 diverse business fields to launch a new career or accelerate into a management role. Available fields to specialise in:\nFor example, if you have been working as an engineer, you can study this program and specialise in Advertising and Marketing to transition to a marketing manager role. Or, regardless of the industry you work in, you could complete the Human Resource Management and Leadership fields of study to move into a more senior management role.\nThis 2-year program will build your practical and theoretical knowledge of the accounting, information systems and financial services industries to prepare you to move into senior technical and management roles. You can specialise in any of the 3 areas (Applied Finance, Information Systems, Professional Accounting) or combine 1 field of study with your choice of up to 8 electives.\nThis 2-year program will equip you with the connections, practical experience and industry expertise to launch or advance a successful global managerial career in events, travel, hotels and tourism. Deep dive into a particular area of interest and hone your expertise with 1 of 3 specialist fields of study: Event Management, Hotel Management, or Travel and Tourism Management.\nThis career-accelerating program will equip business leaders for success in any field and can be tailored to suit your goals, with the chance to create a unique study plan that flexes with changing work and life priorities.\nThe program has helped students from a wide range of industries and roles transition into new positions and industries. Some examples include defence force personnel and business owners shifting into corporate leadership roles, or those with specialist skills in healthcare or engineering transitioning into consulting and executive roles.\nDiscover what you can do with an MBA.\nFor David Elchuk, finding the right master’s degree in business to pivot in his career meant moving from Canada to Australia.\n\"I chose to study the Master of Entrepreneurship and Innovation because I wanted to augment my degree in biotechnology and start a business,\" he says.\n\"There weren't any similar programs in Canada, and it was worth the trip.\"\nI was able to customise my course load based on my undergraduate study to focus on specific courses. You can request to take a course outside the curriculum if it aligns with your major, interests or future career path.\nIf you’re looking to explore a field further in future by completing a higher degree by research (HDR), any of these career change programs will provide you with a pathway to do this.\nThese business master degrees can be a pathway to more senior leadership, management or executive roles – roles that require a broader understanding of managing across all business functions. For example, these programs are ideal if you’re a doctor who wants to become a senior lead in health management, or to run a chain of practices, or to commercialise an invention.\nWhatever your background, these 2 programs can help you make this move.\nA fourth reason you may be considering studying a master’s degree in business, is if you’re new to Brisbane or Australia. If you’ve immigrated from interstate or overseas, you may be hoping to gain “local legitimacy” by studying at a prestigious institution in the area.\nAny of our business postgraduate programs will help you achieve this goal and connect you with new, highly valuable peer and industry networks.

There’s always something new to learn.\nAfter exploring my options, UQ stood out because of its outstanding reputation, practical, industry-relevant curriculum and strong support for students. The support available at my previous university was very different from what I experienced during my bachelor's program.\nSahil: I chose to study the UQ Master of Commerce because of its strong reputation for academic excellence and its alignment with my career aspirations. UQ is renowned globally for its high-quality education and strong industry connections.\nThe program’s flexible structure has allowed me to specialise in areas like information systems and finance, which perfectly matches my interests and career goals. Additionally, UQ's focus on practical, real-life applications, supported by case studies and industry insights, is invaluable for developing a competitive edge in the job market.\nVidushee: I left Sri Lanka and moved to Australia to complete my UQ commerce degree, which wasn’t easy. If you’re considering doing the same, know that the start of the journey is normally an uphill climb. But once you get into the groove of things, you’ll start enjoying the view.\nSahil: I prepared for my postgraduate commerce studies by building a solid foundation in relevant subjects during my undergraduate studies and gaining practical experience in the field. I took courses in financial valuation, analytical skills and accounting principles, which gave me a strong understanding of key concepts I knew would be essential for advanced study.\nI sought out opportunities to apply this knowledge in real-life settings, such as my internship at a micro venture capital business in India. This allowed me to gain practical skills like financial analysis, analytical modelling and proactive communication. I also prepared by researching the program’s structure and core subjects to identify where I might need more focus.\nLastly, I stayed informed about industry trends and current events in commerce to ensure I started the program with a clear understanding of how theory connects to today’s business world.\nVidushee: I went from working full time to studying full time (4 courses each semester over 2 years) and working part time in financial planning. Coming up with a routine that prioritised the goals I wanted to achieve helped me get through this phase in my life.\nSahil: The study load is challenging but manageable. It's about finding the right balance between coursework, research and practical applications.\nVidushee: The experience between degrees was very different for me because I didn’t have any assignments during my undergraduate degree. There was only one final exam, which was pass or fail, so that was very stressful. Having assignments and mid-semester exams that contributed to my final grade during the master’s degree helped me manage my workload effectively and use different study styles.\nSahil: Studying the UQ Master of Commerce has felt more specialised and focused compared to an undergraduate degree. In my undergraduate degree, I was learning vast amounts of information but not going deep into subjects to learn the crux. However, the master’s program has given me the opportunity to dive deeper into advanced concepts, emphasise critical thinking and tackle real-world applications and industry engagement. While the workload is more intense, it has been highly rewarding and has allowed me to build extensive knowledge in the field.\nVidushee: I enjoyed the engagement each lecturer promoted during classes. We were always encouraged to take part in class discussions and work through the topics at hand. In Business Information Systems Analysis and Design (BISM7255), we were tasked with designing a vending machine app, which I found both challenging and interesting. Coming from a finance background and being able to say I’ve created an app was very appealing.\nSahil: I thoroughly enjoyed the hands-on, practical experiences that brought commerce concepts to life. One of the highlights was participating in a live trading game during my finance course, where I had to strategically allocate funds in a simulated portfolio. This experience allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge to a dynamic, real-time environment, sharpening my decision-making and analytical skills. The program's focus on bridging theory with practice, through activities like this, made learning exciting and deeply rewarding.\nVidushee: Dr Micheal Axelsen, Shahrzad Gohar and Associate Professor Christoph Breidbach were especially helpful, and I enjoyed their courses as well:\nSahil: Courses such as Portfolio Management, Financial Risk Management and Data Analytics have been incredibly invaluable, and professors like Dr Michael Axelsen, Dr Avijit Sengupta and Dr Khoa Hoang have provided guidance and insights that have enriched my academic journey.\nSahil: By completing the UQ Master of Commerce, I aim to gain advanced knowledge and specialised skills in finance that would allow me to propel my career into investment banking, private equity or venture capital. I want to enhance my analytical and problem-solving abilities to address complex business challenges and position myself as a competitive candidate in the global job market. Ultimately, I hope to leverage this qualification to advance my career, contribute meaningfully to the industry, and make a positive impact in my field.\nI currently work in the financial planning field. Subjects like portfolio management and financial institutions and markets helped me a lot with my work.\nVidushee: When you study at UQ, you’ll develop practical experience through assignments, clubs and societies relating to your field of study and networking opportunities. There’s also UQ Ventures, which gives you the ability to explore your entrepreneurial side. It’s about finding out what’s out there, using the resources you have at your disposal, and learning what works for you.\nSahil: I've had the opportunity to engage in live projects and case studies, which have provided me with hands-on experience and connected me with industry professionals.\nVidushee: I was an active volunteer at UQ Life events, a UQ Get Set Mentor and part of the Master of Commerce Student Program Committee.\nSahil: As the President of the Master of Commerce Student Program Committee, I had the privilege of organising a range of initiatives designed to enhance the student experience, from academic workshops to social networking events. One of the highlights of my time at UQ was participating in the Business Revue, a theatre play organised by The University of Queensland Business Association (UQBA), which won the award for Best Event of the Year in 2024.\nAdditionally, I was an active member of both the UQ Business School Postgraduate Association (UQBSPA) and UQBA. These roles allowed me to engage in diverse activities, from professional networking to creative collaborations. UQ offers an incredible variety of extracurricular opportunities, enabling students to explore their passions, develop leadership skills, and make meaningful contributions to the vibrant campus community.\nVidushee: Immerse yourself in everything UQ has to offer. Especially as an international student, being on campus, making new friends and having new experiences really helps take your mind off being away from home.\nSahil: For anyone considering the UQ Master of Commerce, I would say that it's an excellent ecosystem for any student in which they can grow in all fields including accounting, finance and information systems. The environment of the campus is extremely supportive and encouraging, providing plenty of opportunities for networking with industry leaders.\nFind out how to get postgrad ready in 12 months or discover what it’s like to study postgraduate programs in other fields of interest.\n5-minute read\n4-minute read\n6-minute read\n4-minute read\n• a citizen of Australia or New Zealand,\n• an Australian permanent resident, or\n• a holder of an Australian permanent humanitarian visa.\n• intending to study on a student visa,\n• not a citizen of Australia or New Zealand,\n• not an Australian permanent resident, or\n• a temporary resident (visa status) of Australia.\n• Business Process Improvement\n• Business Information Systems Capstone\n• Information Systems Governance and Assurance.\n• Master of Commerce (1.5 years or 2 years full time)\n• Graduate Certificate in Commerce (6 months)\n[GRID_TABLE]\nYou're a domestic student if you are:\n\na citizen of Australia or New Zealand,\nan Australian permanent resident, or\na holder of an Australian permanent humanitarian visa.\n\n\nChange to domestic\nContinue as domestic\nYou're an international student if you are:\n\nintending to study on a student visa,\nnot a citizen of Australia or New Zealand,\nnot an Australian permanent resident, or\na temporary resident (visa status) of Australia.\n\n\nChange to international\nContinue as international\n[GRID_TABLE]\nUni life\nPublished 8 Apr, 2022  ·  7-minute read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere’s so much more to a UQ commerce degree than spreadsheets and numbers, according to our Master of Commerce students and graduates.\nInternational student Sahil Shajahan and graduate Vidushee Costa share what it’s like to study the UQ commerce degree, how it’s preparing them for career success, and their advice for others considering the degree.\nWhy did you choose to study the UQ Master of Commerce?\nVidushee: After completing my bachelor’s degree in accounting and finance and working for 2 years in the financial planning field, I decided it was the right time to enhance my knowledge in an area I was passionate about.
