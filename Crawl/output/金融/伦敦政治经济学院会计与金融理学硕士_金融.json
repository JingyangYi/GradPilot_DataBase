The programme has an outstanding reputation that extends over five decades. It's suitable for those who are interested in pursuing careers in the fields of accounting, finance, management, consulting, regulation or academia.\nYou're expected to have taken academic courses in accounting, finance or economics, and quantitative methods prior to entry. Strong candidates who don't have the appropriate background in one or more of these areas may be required to take additional courses before being accepted.\nTeaching in the Department of Accounting is world class, and you'll benefit from our faculty’s strong international and interdisciplinary orientation. A particular teaching strength is exploring the interface between accounting and managers, organisations, institutions, public policy and regulatory bodies.\nThe department is one of the leading groups in the world for teaching and research on the economic, institutional and organisational aspects of accounting and financial management. It’s also home to the Centre for Analysis of Risk and Regulation (CARR), an interdisciplinary research unit focused on the organisational and institutional settings for risk management and regulatory practices.\nPrevious graduates of the programme have gone on to enjoy successful careers in a wide range of sectors, including finance, accounting, consulting, policy, and academia.\nThe MSc Accounting and Finance is accredited by the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA).\nWe're also proud that the MSc Accounting and Finance programme is affiliated with the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) Institute. Through this affiliation, we can offer a limited number of CFA Programme scholarships to our students each year.\nUpper second-class honours degree (2:1) or equivalent in accounting and finance or a related subject. You'd normally be expected to have studied academic courses in accounting, finance, economics, and quantitative methods. Strong candidates who don't have the appropriate background in one or more of these areas may be required to take additional courses before being accepted.\nAll applicants without a UK undergraduate degree must submit GMAT or GRE test scores with their application. See more information below under \"Additional tests\".\nIf you've studied or are studying outside of the UK, please select your country from the dropdown list below to find out the entry requirements that apply to you.\nPlease note: Given the high competition for places on this programme, applicants who indicate an interest in the MSc Accounting and Finance specifically as their first choice will maximise their prospect of admission to the programme. Equally, you should note the differentiated nature of the graduate programmes in the Department of Accounting, and are advised to identify your first choice accordingly. A transfer from another programme in the department will not be permitted.\nAll applicants without a UK undergraduate degree must submit GMAT or GRE test scores with their application. The overall GMAT score should normally be in excess of 650 points. Applicants with UK undergraduate degrees, particularly those whose quantitative skills are not demonstrated by their undergraduate studies, may be asked to submit GMAT or GRE scores.\nFind out more about GRE/GMAT\nEnglish language requirements\nThe English language requirement for this programme is Standard. Read more about our English language requirements.\nCompetition for places at LSE is strong. So, even if you meet the minimum entry requirements, this does not guarantee you an offer of a place.\nHowever, please don’t feel deterred from applying – we want to hear from all suitably qualified students. Think carefully about how you can put together the strongest possible application to help you stand out.\nYou must successfully complete the equivalent of four full-unit courses to meet the requirements of the MSc Accounting and Finance programme. Results from each of the full-unit courses carry proportionate and equal weight in the final assessment of the degree.

You can then select from a combination of optional full and half unit courses in specific areas of accounting and finance to fit your interests and preferred specialisation.\nWatch videos about the courses.\nFor the latest list of courses, please go to the relevant School Calendar page.\nA few important points you’ll need to know:\nPlease note that the nine-month and ten-month full time master's programmes are not compliant with the Bologna process, which may affect the extent to which they're recognised. For more information, see Bologna process.\nWe may need to change, suspend or withdraw a course or programme of study, or change the fees due to unforeseen circumstances. We’ll always notify you as early as possible and recommend alternatives where we can.\nThe School is not liable for changes to published information or for changing, suspending or withdrawing a course or programme of study due to events outside our control (including a lack of demand, industrial action, fire, flooding or other damage to premises).\nPlaces are limited on some courses and/or subject to specific entry requirements so we cannot therefore guarantee you a place.\nChanges to programmes and courses may be made after you’ve accepted your offer of a place – normally due to global developments in the discipline or student feedback. We may also make changes to course content, teaching formats or assessment methods but these are always made to improve the learning experience.\nFor\nfull details about the availability or content of courses and programmes,\nplease take a look at the School’s Calendar, or contact\nthe relevant academic department.\nSome\nmajor changes to programmes/courses are posted on our updated graduate course and programme information page.\nDiscover more about our students and department.\nWelcome to the Department of Accounting – one of the world’s leading centres for accounting and financial management research. The department was rated the top place in the UK to study accounting (Good University Guide 2025).\nOur work is focused on understanding\nthe role played by accounting in organisations, the markets and society at\nlarge. We have strong links with national and international professional bodies\nand regulatory institutions, and our research has contributed to shaping\ninternational accounting practices. Alongside teaching and research, the\ndepartment also hosts the interdisciplinary Centre for Analysis of Risk and Regulation.\nEvery year, we admit more than 400 students to our undergraduate and postgraduate programmes. Our students don’t just learn about accounting principles – they learn how accounting is used in institutional and organisational processes of calculation, reporting and evaluation. This involves exploring the interdependencies between accounting and accountability, sustainability, governance, risk, performance management, policymaking and change.\nWe’re proud of our open and collaborative culture, welcoming students, academics, external speakers and practitioners from around the world – all contributing to our rich and diverse community.\nLearn more about our programmes and research.\nWe welcome applications from all suitably qualified prospective students. At LSE, we want to recruit students with the best academic merit, potential and motivation, irrespective of background.\nWe carefully consider each application and take into account all the information included on your application form, such as your:\nSee further information on supporting documents and check if you're exempt from taking the GRE/GMAT.\nYou may need to provide evidence of your English language proficiency. See our English language requirements.\nApplications for this programme are considered on a rolling basis. This means that applications will close once the programme is full.\nThere is no fixed deadline. However, if you’d like to be considered for any funding opportunities, you must submit your application (and all supporting documents) by the funding deadline. See the fees and funding section below for more details.\nThe\ntable of fees shows the latest tuition fees for all programmes.\nYou're charged a fee for your programme. At LSE, your tuition fee covers registration and examination fees payable to the School, lectures, classes and individual supervision, lectures given at other colleges under intercollegiate arrangements and, under current arrangements, membership of the Students' Union. It doesn't cover living costs or travel or fieldwork.\nHome student fee (2025/26)\nFor this programme, the tuition fee is different for home and overseas students depending on their fee status.\nOverseas student fee (2025/26)\nAt LSE, your tuition fees, and eligibility for any financial support, will depend on whether you’re classified as a home or overseas student (known as your fee status). We assess your fee status based on guidelines provided by the Department for Education.\nFurther information about fee status classification.\nFee reduction\nStudents who completed undergraduate study at LSE and are beginning taught graduate study at the School are eligible for a fee reduction of around 10 per cent of the fee.\nScholarships and other funding\nWe recognise\nthat the cost of living in London may\nbe higher than in your home town/city or country and we provide generous\nscholarships to help both home and overseas students.\nWe offer some\nneeds-based awards for this programme, including the Graduate Support Scheme, Master's Awards, and Anniversary Scholarships.

This is designed to help with fees and living costs. Some other governments and organisations also offer tuition fee loan schemes.\nFind out more about tuition fee loans.\nFurther information\nLearn more\nabout fees and funding opportunities.\nContact hours and independent study\nA short, focused, introductory course on accounting practices and techniques will be held at the beginning of the programme. Thereafter, you take examined courses up to a total of four full units. The average number of contact hours per week is 12 hours, which includes lectures and seminars. Hours vary according to courses and you can view indicative details in the Calendar within the Teaching section of each course guide.\nYou're also expected to complete independent study outside of class time. This varies depending on the programme, but requires you to manage the majority of your study time yourself, by engaging in activities such as reading, note-taking, thinking and research.\nTeaching methods\nCourses are taught in lecture and class or seminar format. Lectures introduce the core theoretical and technical concepts whilst their associated classes allow you to discuss and apply these concepts through exercises and in-depth study. Seminars allow for the focused study of key concepts in a more informal style and often involve presentations by students on selected course materials. Many teachers adopt a variety of teaching methods to deliver their courses, such as class exercises, team presentations, individual or group work, or case study discussions.\nLSE is internationally recognised for its teaching and research and therefore employs a rich variety of teaching staff with a range of experience and status. Courses may be taught by individual members of faculty, such as lecturers, senior lecturers, readers, associate professors and professors. Many departments now also employ guest teachers and visiting members of staff, LSE teaching fellows and graduate teaching assistants who are usually doctoral research students and in the majority of cases, teach on undergraduate courses only. You can view indicative details for the teacher responsible for each course in the relevant course guide.\nAcademic mentor: you’ll meet with your academic mentor regularly to discuss your work. Your mentor can provide advice and guidance on academic issues and, where appropriate, personal concerns.\nOther academic support: at LSE, we offer lots of opportunities to extend your learning outside the classroom.\nLSE LIFE is a great place to get advice and practise the skills you’ll need during your studies and beyond.\nThrough LSE LIFE, you can:\nDisability and Mental Health Service: we want all LSE students to achieve their full potential. Students can access free, confidential advice through our Disability and Mental Health Service. This is the first point of contact for students.\nAll taught courses are required to include formative coursework which is unassessed. It's designed to help prepare you for summative assessment which counts towards the course mark and to the degree award. All full-unit courses are assessed by three hour unseen examinations in the Spring Term. Half-units are assessed by two hour unseen examinations. Some of the half-unit optional courses also have group/individual project work as part of the assessment. An indication of the formative coursework and summative assessment for each course can be found in the relevant course guide.\nStudents who successfully complete the MSc Accounting and Finance programme pursue careers across a wide range of sectors, in financial institutions, accounting firms, management consulting, industry, government and academia.\nOur graduates have gone on to work at companies, including:\nFurther information on graduate destinations for this programme\nFrom CV workshops through to careers fairs, LSE offers lots of information and support to help you make that

Most delays and confusion are caused when applicants do not follow our instructions.\nYou must apply early, as competition for programmes at LSE is intense. Your application will not be considered until we have received all your supporting documents. Wherever possible you should submit all of your documents with your online application. You should expect to wait an average of 8 weeks for a decision when applying for a taught programme; decisions for a research programme may take longer than this.\nImportant:  LSE expects all applicants to complete their application materials without the use of paid agents or other paid professional assistance. The use of such services may lead to the rejection of application materials, the revocation of an admissions offer, cancellation of admission, or involuntary withdrawal from the University.\nUnscrupulous agents have been known to charge large sums to applicants, and then to submit fraudulent transcripts and references. They have refused to allow applicants access to their own records on our Graduate Applicant Portal Applicants have been left unable to attend LSE and having to sue the agent for financial redress. Agents who claim to 'guarantee' entry to LSE are lying. All applications are considered on their own merits and all applicants can and should submit their own information.\nNOTICE: Please be aware of an issue that has come to our attention regarding email junk/spam filters. Some email software is filtering LSE emails to the spam/junk or ‘Deleted Items/Bin’ folder so please make sure to check there for important information regarding your application. If you do find any of our emails in any of these folders, please make sure to add the domain @lse.ac.uk to your ‘Safe Senders’ or ‘Never Block’ list. Emails will be sent to you automatically from our database system once you have begun your online application and as your application progresses through each step in the process (application created; application submitted; application downloaded for processing). We will then send you a further email each time there is an update to the status of your application, including any requests for further information and the programme selectors’ decision on your application. It is essential that you ensure you can successfully receive our emails as soon as you begin your application.\nYou will need to create an account in the online application system using your email address. You should use the same email address for your application and any enquiries to us. You do not need to complete the online application form at one sitting; you can return to your partially completed application by logging back into the system using the email address and password you create at the start of the process.\nYou may submit an application via the online application system only ONCE within the application cycle (October 2024 to September 2025), so before submitting your application you should ensure that you have included all of the information you would like the selectors to review. Any further changes after your application has been submitted must be requested via the Graduate Applicant Portal and will be subject to our current processing times.\nYou must upload all of your supporting documents and nominate two referees via the online application system. The online application allows you to submit your complete application securely and quickly. Your submitted application will not be processed and considered until we have received all the required supporting documents, including a reference from each of the referees you nominate on your online application.\nIf you encounter any technical issues while completing your application, please use the “technical support” link located in the bottom-left corner of the application portal to contact us. If you begin a further new application you will not be able to transfer any information, documents, or references between them.\nWhen completing your initial online application, you may choose up to two programmes in order of preference. If you are applying for two programmes, please submit a separate statement of academic purpose for each programme. Your choices will be considered in sequence, and it is only possible to hold one offer of a place, so if you are offered a place on your first-choice programme you will not be considered for your second-choice unless you specifically request it. If you receive an offer on your first choice, and wish us to send your second choice to be considered too, please use the Add/Amend programmes form on the Graduate Applicant Portal, selecting your current second choice programme as the programme you wish to be considered for.\nIf you are unsuccessful in your application to both of your initially chosen programmes and you wish to be considered for further, additional choices, you may do this by submitting the Add/Amend programmes via the Graduate Applicant Portal and paying an additional administrative fee of £105. You should not use this form to add choices 3 and 4 before receiving a decision on each of your original programme choices, unless you wish to withdraw your initial programme choices.\nPlease note that changing your programme choices after you have submitted your online application may cause significant delays to your application being considered.\nYou are not permitted to submit an application using the online application system more than ONCE in the same admissions cycle. If you submit a second online application within the same admissions cycle, it will not be considered. To apply to further programmes after you have submitted your initial online application, you must use the process above.\nAll applications must be accompanied by supporting documents. Some of these are required by all applicants, others are only needed for specific programmes. Details of specific requirements are given on the programme pages.\nPlease consult our guide to supporting documents for full information about what you will need.\nPlease do not send supporting documents directly to departments as this will delay your application.\nPlease remember that it is your responsibility to ensure that your application is complete, including both references, your statement of academic purpose and CV, your transcript(s), the application assessment fee, and, where applicable, GRE/GMAT scores, your research proposal and/or your sample of written work.\nLSE has developed a number of programmes which are administered jointly with other institutions such as Peking University in China and University of Southern California in the USA.

We will advise you of the decision as soon as possible.\nTo apply as a visiting research student, you apply in the same way as for our MPhil/MRes/PhD programmes, with the same entry criteria.\nWe welcome applications for research programmes that complement the academic interests of our staff at LSE.

They are available for UK, EU and international students undertaking research in any LSE discipline, with annual renewal subject to satisfactory academic performance.\nThese awards will be made solely on the basis of outstanding academic merit and research potential. This relates both to your past academic record and to an assessment of your likely aptitude to complete a PhD in your chosen topic in the time allocated.\nESRC funding\nLSE has an Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) Doctoral Training Partnership (DTP) and has ESRC studentships in a number of programmes across 19 departments. These studentships are available for students of all nationalities.\nThe structure and duration of the studentship offered will depend on a candidate's previous academic experience, and social research training & experience. ESRC studentships are applicable to both full-time and part-time study. We can discuss part-time options with you if you are interested in applying.

Students of all nationalities can apply for one of these studentships.\nStudentships are tenable for three years and they cover full fees (for international students, LSE will cover the difference between UK and overseas fees) and an annual stipend. UKRI expects all projects to be designed in a way that enables students to submit within their funded period.\nLSE Departments that typically host AHRC studentships are International History, Media and Communications, Philosophy and Law, but students from other disciplines (for example, Anthropology, Gender Studies and International Development), can also apply if their research falls within the remit of AHRC, as explained here.\nLSE CSC Scholarship\nLSE is proud to partner with the China Scholarship Council (CSC) to offer the LSE-CSC Scholarship. This prestigious scholarship supports outstanding students from China in pursuing their research degree at LSE.\nLSE is pleased to offer up to eight scholarships each academic year. These scholarships are tenable for up to four years and recipients must be enrolled in a full time study mode.\nDepartment-specific funding\nCheck the programme-related funding page for PhD funding opportunities.\nHow to apply\nExcept for LAHP studentships (see below), academic departments nominate students for the funding opportunity they may be eligible for.

They are available for UK, EU and international students undertaking research in any LSE discipline, with annual renewal subject to satisfactory academic performance.\nThese awards will be made solely on the basis of outstanding academic merit and research potential. This relates both to your past academic record and to an assessment of your likely aptitude to complete a PhD in your chosen topic in the time allocated.\nESRC funding\nLSE has an Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) Doctoral Training Partnership (DTP) and has ESRC studentships in a number of programmes across 19 departments. These studentships are available for students of all nationalities.\nThe structure and duration of the studentship offered will depend on a candidate's previous academic experience, and social research training & experience. ESRC studentships are applicable to both full-time and part-time study. We can discuss part-time options with you if you are interested in applying. They cover full fees (for international students, LSE will cover the difference between UK and overseas fees) and an annual stipend.\nIndividual programme entries detail which programme are eligible for ESRC funding.\nAHRC funding\nLSE is part of LAHP (London Arts and Humanities Partnership), which is funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council. Students of all nationalities can apply for one of these studentships.\nStudentships are tenable for three years and they cover full fees (for international students, LSE will cover the difference between UK and overseas fees) and an annual stipend. UKRI expects all projects to be designed in a way that enables students to submit within their funded period. \nLSE Departments that typically host AHRC studentships are International History, Media and Communications, Philosophy and Law, but students from other disciplines (for example, Anthropology, Gender Studies and International Development), can also apply if their research falls within the remit of AHRC, as explained here.\nLSE CSC Scholarship\nLSE is proud to partner with the China Scholarship Council (CSC) to offer the LSE-CSC Scholarship. This prestigious scholarship supports outstanding students from China in pursuing their research degree at LSE. \nLSE is pleased to offer up to eight scholarships each academic year. These scholarships are tenable for up to four years and recipients must be enrolled in a full time study mode. \nDepartment-specific funding\nCheck the programme-related funding page for PhD funding opportunities.\nHow to apply\nExcept for LAHP studentships (see below), academic departments nominate students for the funding opportunity they may be eligible for.

This course is not available as an outside option.\nStudents wishing to select this option must first prepare a dissertation proposal in MT (approx. 500 words). This should be submitted to the programme manager by 22 November. The course convener will then review the submissions, and for those with sufficient potential, will allocate a suitable supervisor. Approval for this option will only be forthcoming for those with submissions that reach the required standard and for which a suitable supervisor is available.\nCourse content\nThe dissertation usually consists of an empirical investigation of a selected problem.\nThe dissertation must identify relevant issues, sustain reasoned argument, and draw supportable conclusions. It must be arranged in an organized manner and include a full bibliography.\nca. 6 hours; this involves, amongst other things, a research essay workshop, a group discussion of research essay outlines and one-to-one supervisory meetings.\nStudents are expected to work largely independently on their own. There will be an introductory orientation at the beginning of Winter Term on how to write and research for a long essay, including the use of library resources. Thereafter students receive at least two one-to-one supervisory sessions prior to final submission to help with the definition, orientation and execution of the research topic.\nIn addition, a workshop will be organised for all students where they discuss and receive collective feedback on their dissertation outlines.\nFormative coursework\nStudents will receive feedback on their dissertation outlines and draft work that they submit to their supervisors. Students will have two meetings with their supervisors where they receive feedback on submitted written work.\nStudents will be required to produce written work in preparation for the meetings with their supervisors and for the joint workshop where the dissertation outlines are discussed.\nIndicative reading\nRelevant readings will depend on the specific area of research. This will likely be self-managed by the student with guidance from their supervisor.\nDissertation (100%, 8000 words) in the ST.\nTwo typewritten copies of the research essay (6000-8000 words) must be submitted to the MSc Programme Manager by 30 May. An additional electronic copy must be uploaded to Moodle no later than 4.00pm on the same day.\nDepartment: Accounting\nTotal students 2023/24: 4\nAverage class size 2023/24: Unavailable\nControlled access 2023/24: No\nValue: Half Unit\nCourse selection videos\nSome departments have produced short videos to introduce their courses.

Any offer of admission will be subject to proof of your score.\nIf you have not taken a test by the time you apply, your application can still be considered without it, but any offer will be conditional on the required score. Please note that people applying via Sciences Po to Double Degree programmes must meet the requirement at the point they apply.\nYou can meet our language requirements in the following ways:\nYou are a national and resident of Canada or one of the UKVI list of majority English-speaking countries below (whose first language is English).
