Please note that a non-refundable application fee of AUD$150* applies for every application submitted to Adelaide University.\nWe’ve put together the information below to help you prepare, submit and track your application status.\nYou’ll need to provide certified copies of your official academic documents as part of your application. This includes academic transcripts and graduation certificates for all secondary school, tertiary studies and professional qualifications (e.g. short courses).\nIf your official documents are in a language other than English, you will also need to provide certified translations of these documents, in addition to certified copies of the original non-English documents. To find out more about document certification, contact us.\nBefore you apply, it’s a good idea to familiarise yourself with the application closing date for your chosen degree.\nPlease note some degrees have different application deadlines. We recommend you check the specific deadline for your chosen degree on the program page.\nIt’s important to make sure you understand the eligibility criteria and entry requirements for your chosen degree. Look out for any prerequisites or assumed knowledge subjects, as well as additional entry requirements like interviews or auditions.\nFor more information, review the entry requirements for your chosen degree.\nInternational students seeking admissions to coursework degrees must meet our minimum English language requirements. You can demonstrate your level of English language proficiency by providing the results of an accepted English language test (e.g. IELTS, TOEFL iBT). In some cases, you can also meet minimum language requirements using your previous academic qualifications (e.g. International Baccalaureate) or through practical application of your English skills in a professional environment.\nIf you don’t meet the minimum English language requirements, you can still apply for a program. If you meet the academic eligibility requirements for admission, we can send you a conditional offer packaged with a Pre-Enrolment English Program (PEP) pathway through our English Language Centre.\nVisit the entry requirements webpage for or more information.\nPlease ensure you have the following documents ready to upload:\nCertified copies of your academic transcripts and graduate certificates (if applicable) for all secondary school and tertiary studies (if these are in a language other than English, certified translations must also be provided)\nA copy of your passport.\nPlease note that a non-refundable application fee of AUD$150 applies for every application submitted to Adelaide University.\nYou may also need to provide:\nProfessional qualifications (e.g. short courses) or professional memberships you may have\nOfficial English test results from IELTS, TOEFL iBT, Pearson or Cambridge CAE/CPE or another approved objective test\nSyllabus of subjects if you wish to be considered for advanced standing (credit transfer).\nYou may be required to apply through an Adelaide University authorised Education Agent.\nWe have a wide network of Education Agents around the world that can assist you with the preparation and submission of your application, as well as your student visa application.\nStudents from the following regions require an Education Agent to apply:\nThe Middle East\nNorth Africa\nSub-Saharan Africa\nSouth Asia (Bangladesh, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka)\nPhilippines\nLatin America.\nChanging your Education Agent\nIf you have lodged an application though an Adelaide University authorised Education Agent but want to change to a different partner, you’ll need to contact us to nominate a new agent.\nIf you’re applying without an Education Agent, you can lodge your application directly through our Online Application System.\nOnce you've submitted all required documents and paid your application fee, our International Admissions team will begin assessing your application.\nThe team will carefully review your application and provide an outcome as soon as possible. Right now, we're experiencing a high volume of applications, so it may take up to six weeks for us to complete the assessment.\nIf your application requires a credit assessment, the process may take a little longer - up to eight weeks.\nOnce your application has been assessed, Adelaide University will contact you or your Education Agent with an outcome.

The minimum English language requirement for entry to an Adelaide University undergraduate program is an International English Language Testing System (IELTS) Academic overall score of 6.0 or equivalent. However, English language entry requirements are degree specific, and some degrees have higher English language requirements. This means the exact requirement will depend upon the degree you are applying to. Please visit the degree page for more information.\nYou can demonstrate your level of English language proficiency by providing the results of an accepted English language test (e.g. IELTS, PTE), taken within the last two years prior to admission. In some cases, you can also meet minimum language requirements using your previous academic qualifications (e.g. a Diploma completed in Australia) or through practical application of your English skills in a professional environment.

The minimum English language requirement for entry to an Adelaide University undergraduate program is an International English Language Testing System (IELTS) Academic overall score of 6.0 or equivalent. However, English language entry requirements are degree specific, and some degrees have higher English language requirements. This means the exact requirement will depend upon the degree you are applying to. Please visit the degree page for more information. \nYou can demonstrate your level of English language proficiency by providing the results of an accepted English language test (e.g. IELTS, PTE), taken within the last two years prior to admission. In some cases, you can also meet minimum language requirements using your previous academic qualifications (e.g. a Diploma completed in Australia) or through practical application of your English skills in a professional environment. Where previous study/work experience was conducted in English, the application must be accompanied by certified documentation from the educational institution/employer certifying that the language of instruction/employment was English.  \nIf you don’t meet the minimum English language requirements, you can still apply for a program and if you meet the academic eligibility requirements for admission, we can send you a conditional offer packaged with an English language preparatory program from our English Language Centre.\nProof of English language proficiency, in addition to the academic entry requirements, does not guarantee a place at Adelaide University. Applications are considered on an individual basis and selection is competitive.\nMore information   \nFor a comprehensive list of all English language tests accepted by Adelaide University, please visit the English language proficiency page.\n[CARD]\nThe Genuine Student (GS) requirement is an Australian Government integrity measure that applies to all student visa applicants. It considers whether the individual circumstances of a student indicate that their intention is to stay in Australia specifically for study. \nAll applicants for a student visa must be a genuine applicant for entry. They must stay as a student and be able to show an understanding that studying in Australia is the primary reason of their student visa. The GS requirement is intended to include students who, after studying in Australia, develop skills Australia needs and who then go on to apply for permanent residence. \nYour offer may include a condition requiring satisfaction of Adelaide University’s Genuine Student requirement. We will undertake further checks of your application and you may be asked to book and complete an interview as part of this process.\n[CARD]\nAdelaide University must also be satisfied that you are able to financially support yourself and your accompanying family (if you have dependants) while you are studying. This means that you must be able to meet the cost of tuition fees and your living expenses, and that you understand that you will not be able to ask the University to waive your tuition fees, or pay any of your costs while you are living in Australia.\nView non-tuition fees",
