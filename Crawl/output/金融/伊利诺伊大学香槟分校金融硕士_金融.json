For instance, you may choose to follow a specialization track in one of the following areas: Asset Management, Corporate Finance, Data Analytics and Fintech, Quantitative Finance, and Finance Research (PhD Specialization).\nAccording to the University’s academic catalogue, a graduate concentration constitutes a coherent program of study requiring additional breadth or considerable depth of knowledge. A concentration may refer to a subfield within a discipline, or to an interdepartmental and/or interdisciplinary area of knowledge. In other words, a graduate concentration is similar to a minor. Students must take a minimum of 12 credits of the required courses in order to earn a concentration. Your concentration appears on your academic transcript. We currently offer concentrations in Accountancy and Data Analytics in Finance.\nA specialization, on the other hand, is more informal. A minimum of 16 credits of courses in any chosen area is needed to be awarded a specialization. Your specialization does not show on your transcript or your certificate of degree. Instead, you will receive an official letter from the program director as an evidence of the specialization.\nGies is a CFA partner school, so our curriculum aligns with the CFA requirements. The MSF curriculum provides very good preparation for CFA Level I, Level II, and Level III examinations.\nMost MSF students typically enroll in 12-16 credit hours per semester. Students have the option to enroll in more credit hours, up to 20, if approved by the program’s administration. International students are required to uphold full-time status by registering for a minimum of 12 credit hours each semester, unless it is their final semester, or they have obtained permission otherwise.\nTo graduate, students must earn a minimum of 40 credit hours, among which 28 credit hours are in Finance, including required courses and preparatory courses (if needed). The remaining 12 credit hours can be taken from a related discipline of your choice, including Accounting, Economics, Math, computer science, etc., or you can take more Finance electives.\nDuring the Fall and Spring terms classes are offered Monday through Thursday, typically during the day, but in some cases a class is offered in the evening. A class is typically held two days (twice) a week for an hour and twenty minutes each day.\nThroughout the entire year, Friday afternoons are typically reserved for Professional Development activities such as guest lecturers, field trips, and other career development activities.\nGies College of Business has a vast number of finance course offerings. However, all courses are not offered each semester. When developing a study plan, students should note the terms that courses are offered in order to sequence their courses to meet their goals. Professor Martin Widdicks, Director of the MSF program, is available to guide students with their plans.\nYes! We have a full-time faculty member with extensive experience to guide you as you develop your study plan. You will work closely with Professor Martin Widdicks, Director of the MSF program, to define your study plan. Professor Widdicks provides individualized attention for MSF students so that their study plans accurately reflect their academic goals.\nYes. MSF students can participate in the MSF Practicum and the annual Investment Challenge.\nNo. The program is solely based on coursework.\nIn some cases graduates of our MSF program decide to pursue an academic career and continue on to a doctoral program in finance. Although this is not a traditional route that most students take, we do offer a specialization track in finance research to help those who are interested in pursuing a career in academia.\nThe PhD program at Gies is extremely competitive, admitting only 4 or 5 new students a year from several hundred applicants. For more information visit PhD in Finance.\nYou must at least have the equivalent of a 4-year U.S. Bachelor’s degree before we can consider you for admission to the MSF program. To learn more about the minimum requirements for admission, please visit the University of Illinois' Graduate College website.\nAll three-year bachelor’s degrees from an accredited institution in India are now accepted as a comparable bachelor’s degree in the US. You will not need a post-graduate diploma or significant work experience to be considered for admission.\nNo. In fact, some of our best students come from backgrounds such as engineering, math, statistics, physics, and computer science.\nProfessional work experience is recommended, not required. However, all students admitted to the MSF program have some type of work experience. High-quality summer internships and part-time work experience might be enough to compensate for less than two years of full-time work experience if other credentials are sufficiently strong. While the MSF Admissions Committee places a strong emphasis on admitting students with at least 2 years of professional work experience following their undergraduate degree, applicants with less work experience and strong academic credentials are also encouraged to apply.\nYou must scan your transcripts and degree certificates into the on-line application in order to be considered for admission. If admitted, you will then be required to submit original or certified transcripts and degree certificates when you arrive on campus. Please visit the Graduate College website for more information on methods of submitting your final credentials.\nThe MSF program seeks students with strong quantitative skills, which can more easily be assessed with a GMAT or GRE score. The average scores for our admitted students are 680 for the GMAT and 320 for the GRE. We do not have a minimum requirement, and both tests are acceptable.\nNo. The GMAT/GRE test scores are a strong indication of the quantitative and verbal skills of an applicant. While the committee considers the composite application of each applicant, an official GMAT or GRE score must be included.\nMSF students come from a variety of backgrounds, some with stronger math skills than others. The MSF Admissions Committee evaluates quantitative skills as a factor for admission. Coursework in college algebra and calculus are strongly recommended for success in the program.\nA sample of the math skills expected by faculty in the program can be found at Math Skills Assessment. Note that these skills would be sufficient for most master’s level courses taught in the Finance Department, but are not needed in every finance class. The courses in the quantitative finance track require more advanced math skills. A strong grasp of multivariate calculus and an understanding of matrix algebra are strongly recommended.\nTuition and fees are billed each semester with payment due the 28th of the month after the start of each semester. Refer to MSF tuition and fees for details.\nVisit the Office of Student Financial Aid for more information on ways to pay for your educational expenses.\nThe MSF program is a self-supported program, therefore assistantships and fellowship funding are not available. A small scholarship pool is available. All students are considered for these scholarships which are granted based on merit.\nYou may be admitted on limited status for a variety of reasons. The admission letter will clearly indicate the admission terms and the steps that need to be completed before full-admission status can be obtained. Some possible reasons for limited-status admission are:\nAdmission to the MSF program is competitive. Each year the Admissions Committee admits the best applicants from the current application pool. If you are given admission to the program, you may defer your enrollment up to one year with payment of the enrollment deposit. You can also defer your application to the next year for admission consideration as part of the next class if you choose not to pay the enrollment deposit. You will not be penalized for deferring your admission nor will you be given any special consideration beyond the strength of your application for admission during the next year.\nYes. Seats in the MSF program are limited and it is not uncommon to wait-list an applicant. Since not all applicants that are offered admission enroll in the MSF program, the program wait-lists applicants that have strong credentials but for one reason or another were not offered admission. As the admission cycle continues and we find that some of the admitted applicants defer or decline our offer of admission we are able to extend admission offers to some of the wait-listed applicants.\nAdmitted students with considerable experience in Finance may elect to complete their studies in two semesters (fall/spring) with the approval of the Program Director. Criteria for approval includes, but is not limited to, academic qualifications, work experience, GMAT/GRE scores, and communications skills. As the MSF program is designed to be completed in three semesters, the two semester option will be offered only after careful consideration by all parties. Admitted applicants who may qualify for this option will be contacted directly by the program upon notification of admission.\nThe MSF degree is aimed at well qualified, ambitious undergraduates as well as accomplished professionals choosing to return to business school at the master’s level, but who wish to follow a more focused program devoted to learning and excelling in finance.\nMBA in Finance degree on the other hand tends to focus more on offering a comprehensive understanding of business and finance.\nMBA in Finance’s curriculum is more general and less technical. Typical MBA programs in the US usually require fulltime work experience.  \n\nMBA graduates with a strong interest in a finance career who feel they lack solid training in finance will find the MSF program very beneficial to their careers.  \n\nMSF graduates who are interested in advancing their careers to management level positions are also encouraged to pursue an MBA degree.\nYes, you may apply to multiple programs at the University of Illinois. You must provide separate applications and supporting documents to each program. However, you may only be formally admitted to one University of Illinois program at a time. Therefore, if you currently hold an admission from one program on campus, you must decline that offer before you may receive admission from another.\n• Limited status due to a lack of demonstrated English language proficiency\n• Limited status due to low GPA or no comparable bachelor's degree\n• Limited status due to departmental deficiencies\n[GRID_TABLE]\nFrequently Asked QuestionsBelow is a list of the most common questions asked in regards to the Master of Science in Finance (MSF) program.\n\n\n\n\r\n                What areas of finance can I specialize in?\r\n            \nIn addition to the core curriculum, you will select courses to customize your degree.

MSF students can participate in the MSF Practicum and the annual Investment Challenge.\n\n\n\r\n                Does the program require a thesis?\r\n            \nNo. The program is solely based on coursework. \n\n\n\r\n                Can I study a PhD in Finance after the MSF?\r\n            \nIn some cases graduates of our MSF program decide to pursue an academic career and continue on to a doctoral program in finance.

Refer to MSF tuition and fees for details.\n\n\n\r\n                What financial aid is available for students?\r\n            \nVisit the Office of Student Financial Aid for more information on ways to pay for your educational expenses.\n\n\n\r\n                Are fellowships or assistantships available?\r\n            \nThe MSF program is a self-supported program, therefore assistantships and fellowship funding are not available. A small scholarship pool is available. All students are considered for these scholarships which are granted based on merit. \n\n\n\r\n                I received my admission letter and I am admitted on limited status. What does that mean?\r\n            \nYou may be admitted on limited status for a variety of reasons. The admission letter will clearly indicate the admission terms and the steps that need to be completed before full-admission status can be obtained. Some possible reasons for limited-status admission are:Limited status due to a lack of demonstrated English language proficiencyLimited status due to low GPA or no comparable bachelor's degreeLimited status due to departmental deficiencies\n\n\n\r\n                If I am admitted, may I defer enrollment?\r\n            \nAdmission to the MSF program is competitive. Each year the Admissions Committee admits the best applicants from the current application pool. If you are given admission to the program, you may defer your enrollment up to one year with payment of the enrollment deposit. You can also defer your application to the next year for admission consideration as part of the next class if you choose not to pay the enrollment deposit. You will not be penalized for deferring your admission nor will you be given any special consideration beyond the strength of your application for admission during the next year.\n\n\n\r\n                Do you have a waiting list?\r\n            \nYes. Seats in the MSF program are limited and it is not uncommon to wait-list an applicant. Since not all applicants that are offered admission enroll in the MSF program, the program wait-lists applicants that have strong credentials but for one reason or another were not offered admission. As the admission cycle continues and we find that some of the admitted applicants defer or decline our offer of admission we are able to extend admission offers to some of the wait-listed applicants.\n\n\n\r\n                Can I complete the program in less than 3 semesters?\r\n            \nAdmitted students with considerable experience in Finance may elect to complete their studies in two semesters (fall/spring) with the approval of the Program Director. Criteria for approval includes, but is not limited to, academic qualifications, work experience, GMAT/GRE scores, and communications skills. As the MSF program is designed to be completed in three semesters, the two semester option will be offered only after careful consideration by all parties. Admitted applicants who may qualify for this option will be contacted directly by the program upon notification of admission.\n\n\n\r\n                Should I pursue an MSF degree or an MBA in Finance degree?\r\n            \nThe MSF degree is aimed at well qualified, ambitious undergraduates as well as accomplished professionals choosing to return to business school at the master’s level, but who wish to follow a more focused program devoted to learning and excelling in finance. MBA in Finance degree on the other hand tends to focus more on offering a comprehensive understanding of business and finance. MBA in Finance’s curriculum is more general and less technical. Typical MBA programs in the US usually require fulltime work experience.  \n\nMBA graduates with a strong interest in a finance career who feel they lack solid training in finance will find the MSF program very beneficial to their careers.  \n\nMSF graduates who are interested in advancing their careers to management level positions are also encouraged to pursue an MBA degree. \n\n\n\r\n                Can I apply to more than one degree program at the University of Illinois?\r\n            \nYes, you may apply to multiple programs at the University of Illinois. You must provide separate applications and supporting documents to each program. However, you may only be formally admitted to one University of Illinois program at a time. Therefore, if you currently hold an admission from one program on campus, you must decline that offer before you may receive admission from another.",
