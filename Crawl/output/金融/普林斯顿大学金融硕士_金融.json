In all its coursework and activities, the program educates and trains students at the frontiers of finance so they are prepared to lead at the world’s most innovative firms and organizations.\nMany prospective students inquire about the differences between the Master in Finance program and a traditional MBA. While an MBA is valuable for understanding corporate finance and mergers and acquisitions, the Master in Finance degree has become the preferred degree for algorithmic trading, quantitative asset management, risk management, derivatives pricing and trading, fixed income analytics, and other areas where the pricing and analysis of complex securities require significant quantitative input. The program also prepares students for opportunities outside of traditional investment banking, including opportunities in insurance, commercial banking, commodities and energy trading, and risk management for traditional industrial companies.\nThe Master in Finance program invests significant time and resources preparing students for a wide range of careers both inside and outside the financial industry. In addition to studying with some of the world’s leading professors, all enrolled students have access to one-on-one career counseling and support. When searching for jobs and internships, students benefit from the center’s strong connections with its global alumni network.\nCareer Development and Job Placements\nSee current Master in Finance Students\nLearn more and apply\nStudents completing the program in two years have the opportunity to obtain the Graduate Certificate from the Center for Statistics and Machine Learning (CSML).\nData-driven research increasingly involves large-scale, complex data that needs to be analyzed using innovative methods from the fields of statistics and machine learning. This approach, coupled with advancing data science’s underlying methods and algorithms, has become an essential component of modern scientific discovery.\nThe Certificate in Machine Learning deepens and enhances students’ understanding and application of data science techniques and represents Princeton’s commitment to preparing students to lead in these emerging areas.\n• Graduate Programs\n\nMaster in Finance\nWhy BCF\nRequirements and Core Courses\nCareer Development & Recruiting\nMFin Boot Camps\nStudent Experience\nGraduate Application\nRecruit MFin Students\nAlumni\nPh.D. Program\nPh.D. Prize Winners\nPh.D. Student Directory\n• Master in Finance\n• Why BCF\n• Requirements and Core Courses\n• Career Development & Recruiting\n• MFin Boot Camps\n• Student Experience\n• Graduate Application\n• Recruit MFin Students\n• Alumni\n• Ph.D. Program\n• Ph.D. Prize Winners\n• Ph.D. Student Directory\n• Undergraduate Program\n\nMinor in Finance\nWhy BCF\nRequirements\nStudent Experience\nCareer Outcomes\nStudent Application\nCommon Questions\n• Minor in Finance\n• Why BCF\n• Requirements\n• Student Experience\n• Career Outcomes\n• Student Application\n• Common Questions\n• People & Research\n\nBCF Director\nFaculty\nScholars\nStaff\nPublished Papers\nWorking Papers\nFaculty Books\nNotes and Proposals\nPrizes and Awards\n• BCF Director\n• Faculty\n• Scholars\n• Staff\n• Published Papers\n• Working Papers\n• Faculty Books\n• Notes and Proposals\n• Prizes and Awards\n• Events\n• Partners\n• Master in Finance\n• Why BCF\n• Requirements and Core Courses\n• Career Development & Recruiting\n• MFin Boot Camps\n• Student Experience\n• Graduate Application\n• Recruit MFin Students\n• Alumni\n• Ph.D. Program\n• Ph.D. Prize Winners\n• Ph.D. Student Directory\n• Minor in Finance\n• Why BCF\n• Requirements\n• Student Experience\n• Career Outcomes\n• Student Application\n• Common Questions\n• BCF Director\n• Faculty\n• Scholars\n• Staff\n• Published Papers\n• Working Papers\n• Faculty Books\n• Notes and Proposals\n• Prizes and Awards\n• About\n• News & Activities\n• Search\n• Princeton University\n• Twitter\n• LinkedIn\n• Instagram\n• YouTube\n• Why BCF\n• Student Experience\n• Apply for the Master in Finance Program\n• Recruiting, Career Development, and Job Placements\n• Master in Finance Student Directory\n• Join Our Mailing List\n• Common Questions",

Enrolling approximately 35 students out of more than 600 applicants, the program is highly competitive.\nYou’ll learn theory from top Princeton faculty and academic researchers, while also gaining practical skills from leaders in the financial services industry.\nFor our Fall 2025 cohort, we are offering three distinct program tracks based on career interests and goals:\nQuantitative Asset Management\nData Science & Financial Technologies\nValuation and Macroeconomic Analysis\nWe encourage interested students to watch our informational video with BCF Director and Professor Markus Brunnermeier, Professor Caio Ibsen Rodrigues de Almeida, and Manager of Career Development and External Relations Lindsay Bracken.\nThe Master in Finance program is four semesters. A small number of students with strong prior knowledge of the field, mathematical aptitude, and work experience are given the opportunity to take a compressed two-semester program. We will only make a determination about your ability to complete the program in one year after you have been admitted to the program. For more information on the compressed program, please contact Melanie Heaney-Scott at mheaney@princeton.edu.\nThe cost of tuition and the required health plan fee can be found here. More details about tuition and other costs are available online at the Graduate School website.\nBe the first to know when applications open and stay in the loop on the latest BCF news.\nJoin our Mailing List\nApplications to the Fall 2026 program are not yet open. Prospective students interested in applying to the Master in Finance Program should apply through the Graduate School at Princeton University.\nStudents will be required to submit academic transcripts, including math courses taken, three letters of recommendation, a personal statement, and an academic statement of purpose. GRE or GMAT test scores are accepted, but not required. For students whose primary language is not English or who did not either complete their entire undergraduate instruction entirely in English or at least one year of full-time graduate instruction entirely in English, TOEFL, DET, or IELTS test scores are required. For more information on required testing, visit the Princeton grad school site or contact gsadmit@princeton.edu.\nAll applicants are required to take a math assessment. The assessment for applicants to the Fall 2025 program took place on December 28, 2024.\nAll applicants should receive a response to their application by March 15. Due to the large number of candidates that apply each year, it is not possible for us to inform applicants if their applications are incomplete, or give other information during the review process.\nAdmitted students will need to respond by April 15. On-campus housing will be guaranteed only to students whose completed housing application has been received by the university by the reply deadline of April 15.\nThree letters of recommendation are required as part of your application.

For applicants without full-time work experience, two academic references are required. We encourage you to register your recommenders as early as possible to meet the strict application deadline.\nStudents can submit GMAT scores instead of GRE scores. When students register for either test, they must specify that their scores be sent to the Princeton University Office of Graduate Admission. Princeton’s code for the GRE is 2672, and WC1-L5-59 for the GMAT. Princeton does not use department codes. It takes four to six weeks for scores to be released to the Office of Graduate Admission following your request.\nAll information and questions regarding your electronic application should be directed to the Graduate Admission Office.
