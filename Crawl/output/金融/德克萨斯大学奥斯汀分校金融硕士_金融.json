On completion of the core corporate class students will be able to calculate the present and future value of cash flow streams, model projects and calculate project selection metrics such as NPV and IRR, and estimate discount rates for use in project analysis and valuation.\nFIN 286 | 2 credits | core course\nThe valuation course focuses on the valuation of businesses using Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) modeling and comparable company multiples, and includes rigorous assignments involving estimating a firm’s cost of capital using comparable company returns and financial data, and constructing a complete DCF model and valuation for a publicly traded company of their choosing. On completion of the valuation course students will be able to construct and use rigorous valuation spreadsheet models for valuing businesses or major investment projects, estimate costs of capital and firm value using comparable company analysis, and consider real-world adjustments in value related to control premiums or liquidity discounts.\nBA S 284T | 2 credits | core course\nIntroductory Financial Accounting provides an overview of the accrual accounting model, how corporate financial statements report particular economic events, and the economic incentives of corporate managers as they exercise their judgment to prepare financial statements. By the end of the course the students will feel comfortable reading the financial statements in published annual reports, and will be able to come to a reasoned conclusion about a company’s financial health.\n16 credit hours\nFIN 397.1 | 3 credits | core course\nMajor topics in Investment Theory & Practice include modern portfolio theory, asset allocation and the valuation and use of equities, fixed income, derivatives and mutual funds. On completion of this course, students will understand the relationship between risk and return, how decisions are made with respect to putting together a portfolio and how investors select and use different types of securities.\nFIN 394.1  | 3 credits | core course\nAdvanced Corporate Finance focuses on issues concerning raising capital (designing corporate capital structure, issuing equity, debt, convertibles, etc.) and investing it (project evaluation, budgeting, and acquisitions). The course provides an opportunity to acquire or improve useful financial skills such as computing cost of capital, pricing options, assessing and managing financial risk, and valuing acquisitions.\nBA 380S | 3 credits | core course\nManagerial Economics focuses on the microeconomics and macroeconomic forces that influence an organizations decisions, including interest rates, business cycles, financial systems, input demand and supply, industry factors, market structure, and externalities.\nACC 280K | 2 credits | core course\nThis course focuses on issues in financial reporting of publicly held companies and builds upon the accrual accounting model developed in prior courses. By the end of the course, students will have developed a deeper understanding of the accrual accounting model and will have extended their ability to analyze the financial reporting implications of events that lead to scrutiny by equity investors, investment advisors, and the financial press.\nBA 286T | 2 credits | core course\nThe course focuses on the use of data analytic, probability and statistics tools in financial applications. The main topics of the course are probability, conditional expectation, basic estimation concepts and regression analysis. Upon completion of the course, students will master basic statistics and learn how to use regression models to analyze real, applied problems. Emphasis is placed on analysis of actual datasets and the use of appropriate computational tools necessary for the analysis.\nFIN 294.17 | 2 credits | core course\nAdvanced Valuation and Financial Modeling covers a range of topics in the field of financial economics, each of which requires extensive modeling skills. Topics include loan amortization schedules, style analysis, optimal portfolio selection, valuation and takeovers, fixed income derivatives, and equity derivatives. Course work is based on cases studies, academic research, and practitioner research. This is a hands-on course that requires students to analyze data and participate in class discussions.\nBA 191 | 1 credits | core course\nThe Practicum is an intensive program that spans the last half of the fall semester and the first half of the spring semester. Students work directly with sponsoring companies on a wide variety of finance problems.\nStudents may indicate an area of interest for their practicum project in early fall. Students work in small groups under the supervision of the MSF program director to complete the project, earning practical experience and developing a strong relationship with corporations and potential employers.\nThe MSF program director and Finance Department faculty work with various finance-related organizations to design projects that are valuable to MSF students and benefit the sponsoring group. Projects are designed to be accomplished within the Practicum time frame and culminate in a written report and presentation of work to the sponsoring company and program faculty.\n13 credit hours\nACC 280K.7 | 2 credits | core course\nFinancial Statement Analysis I is a case and discussion-based class that provides an overview of the use of qualitative and quantitative financial information to first understand the business and context behind the numbers to then to evaluate and assess performance and consider motivations for future performance. The class follows famed investor Charlie Munger’s advice for business schools for hands-on learning from successful and unsuccessful companies, including numerous contemporaneous examples. The class weaves in the why, how and what next of financial information, including an emphasis on slowing things down to best understand commonly used/misused metrics and jargon. Class discussions are the most important aspect of the class. The goal is to help students become informed users of financial information from a variety of sources and apply this skill to analyzing specific businesses.\nFIN 172 | 2 credits | elective\nFinancial Statement Analysis II is also a case and discussion-based class that extends and builds off of the first Financial Statement Analysis class. It adds a few more areas related to assessing risk, taxes and other slightly more technical applications. We tie things together with by focusing on how relevant and representative financial information can be used to motivated for thoughtful forecasts (i.e., not mindlessly using CAGRs) and cover the need to understand accounting information to motivate thoughtful estimates for company value. We end with an opportunity for students to apply the class lessons from both classes with an interactive stock pitch deliverable. Class discussions are again the most important aspect of the class. The goal is to help students become informed users of financial information and apply this skill to analyzing, forecasting and valuing specific businesses.\nACC 280K | 2 credits | elective\nThis class focuses on issues in financial reporting of publicly held companies and builds upon the accrual accounting model introduced in fall semester’s financial accounting course. Topics include red-flag events that lead to one-off financial reports that lead to news releases and analysis in the financial press — e.g., reporting the effects of prior years’ errors, forecasting the effects of changes in the tax code, issuing and retiring debt securities, issuing and retiring equity securities, removal of assets from the balance sheet via securitization to avoid recognizing related liabilities. By the end of the course, students will have developed a deeper understanding of the accrual accounting model and will have extended their ability to analyze the financial reporting implications of events that lead to scrutiny by equity investors, investment advisors, and the financial press.\nBA 291.3| 2 credits | elective\nThis course provides an overview of the commercial real estate industry. The classes will be a mix of lectures and guest speakers. Our primary out of class activity will be short writing assignments based on current real estate topics.\nThe following topics will be discussed:\nFIN 294.11 | 2 credits | elective\nThe objective of this course is to provide you with a structural understanding of private equity (“PE”) markets, the primary participants in these markets, and the financial strategies that they employ. This class will explore private equity as a major source of capital for new, growing and established private and public firms. As investors have been attracted to PE markets, funds have developed specialized strategies and targeted specific market segments. In addition to LBO and venture funds, there are growth, mezzanine, middle market buyout, infrastructure, and energy funds, among others, that have become attractive investment vehicles for institutional investors, particularly as yields from other investments have declined over the past several years.\nFIN 294.7  | 2 credits | elective\nThe objective of this course is to develop a better understanding of firm financing with a special focus on the decision and the process of raising capital. In particular, we will analyze the factors that inform treasurers’ and CFOs’ choices of capital raising techniques and sources of funds. More specifically, we will consider issues relative to the public equity markets (e.g., IPOs and SEOs) and private equity including venture capital. We will examine debt financing at length. Corporate bonds, bank financing, short-term finance (e.g., commercial paper and credit lines) and other forms of debt financing will be studied.

The class follows famed investor Charlie Munger’s advice for business schools for hands-on learning from successful and unsuccessful companies, including numerous contemporaneous examples. The class weaves in the why, how and what next of financial information, including an emphasis on slowing things down to best understand commonly used/misused metrics and jargon. Class discussions are the most important aspect of the class. The goal is to help students become informed users of financial information from a variety of sources and apply this skill to analyzing specific businesses.\nFinancial Statement Analysis II\nFIN 172 | 2 credits | elective \nFinancial Statement Analysis II is also a case and discussion-based class that extends and builds off of the first Financial Statement Analysis class. It adds a few more areas related to assessing risk, taxes and other slightly more technical applications. We tie things together with by focusing on how relevant and representative financial information can be used to motivated for thoughtful forecasts (i.e., not mindlessly using CAGRs) and cover the need to understand accounting information to motivate thoughtful estimates for company value. We end with an opportunity for students to apply the class lessons from both classes with an interactive stock pitch deliverable. Class discussions are again the most important aspect of the class. The goal is to help students become informed users of financial information and apply this skill to analyzing, forecasting and valuing specific businesses.\nIntermediate Accounting II\nACC 280K | 2 credits | elective\nThis class focuses on issues in financial reporting of publicly held companies and builds upon the accrual accounting model introduced in fall semester’s financial accounting course. Topics include red-flag events that lead to one-off financial reports that lead to news releases and analysis in the financial press — e.g., reporting the effects of prior years’ errors, forecasting the effects of changes in the tax code, issuing and retiring debt securities, issuing and retiring equity securities, removal of assets from the balance sheet via securitization to avoid recognizing related liabilities. By the end of the course, students will have developed a deeper understanding of the accrual accounting model and will have extended their ability to analyze the financial reporting implications of events that lead to scrutiny by equity investors, investment advisors, and the financial press.\nCommercial Real Estate\nBA 291.3| 2 credits | elective\nThis course provides an overview of the commercial real estate industry. The classes will be a mix of lectures and guest speakers. Our primary out of class activity will be short writing assignments based on current real estate topics.\nThe following topics will be discussed:\n\nCommercial real estate careers\nThe commercial real estate cycle\nReal Estate as a “side hustle”\nEquity and debt financing\nReal estate development\nInvestment due diligence\nPrivate Equity\nFIN 294.11 | 2 credits | elective \nThe objective of this course is to provide you with a structural understanding of private equity (“PE”) markets, the primary participants in these markets, and the financial strategies that they employ. This class will explore private equity as a major source of capital for new, growing and established private and public firms. As investors have been attracted to PE markets, funds have developed specialized strategies and targeted specific market segments. In addition to LBO and venture funds, there are growth, mezzanine, middle market buyout, infrastructure, and energy funds, among others, that have become attractive investment vehicles for institutional investors, particularly as yields from other investments have declined over the past several years.\nRaising Capital\nFIN 294.7  | 2 credits | elective\nThe objective of this course is to develop a better understanding of firm financing with a special focus on the decision and the process of raising capital. In particular, we will analyze the factors that inform treasurers’ and CFOs’ choices of capital raising techniques and sources of funds.

Corporate bonds, bank financing, short-term finance (e.g., commercial paper and credit lines) and other forms of debt financing will be studied. Finally, we will discuss bankruptcy and financial restructuring and the decision to finance acquisitions.\nFixed Income Analysis\nFIN 297.5 | 2 credits | elective\nOne of the important aspects of this course is to convey the role of market prices as a means of communicating information to market participants to address questions like:\nWhat are the debt financial-markets metrics which quantify the depth and intensity of economic and political crises? What is the current level of nervousness relative to crisis periods? What are the metrics by which the debt markets quantify future inflation and changes in interest rates?\nThese broader questions will facilitate investigation of a variety of topics, including\n\nEmpirical Regularities of Global Fixed Income Markets\nUnderstanding the fundamentals of bond valuation, including forward rates of interest\nUnderstanding the design, valuation and uses of: Bullet bonds;\nMake-whole bonds; CPI-linked securities; Callable and putable bonds\nEurodollar Futures and Interest Rate Swaps\nDuration and Convexity; Hedging interest rate exposure\nInterest-Rate Volatility\nModeling and Implementing Default Models\nESG Investing\nFIN 297.10 | 2 credits | elective\nThe purpose of this course is two-fold: (1) to provide a conceptual and theoretical foundation for corporate ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) policies and actions and investors’ preferences regarding such policies and actions and (2) how such policies and actions affect firm performance and investor reactions as well as portfolio risk and return. Using a blend of readings, cases, discussions, and a major project, the goal is for you to learn to critically assess the actions of investors and corporations with regard to ESG policies, including the potential motivations and resulting consequences, that is, the valuation effects and externalities\n[GRID_TABLE]\nPracticum in Finance\nBA 191 | 1 credits | core course \nThe Practicum is an intensive program that spans the last half of the fall semester and the first half of the spring semester.

Please use the following loan periods as needed based on when your program begins and ends.\n\nSummer 2025: 6/5/25 – 8/18/25\nFall 2025: 8/19/25 – 1/10/26\nSpring 2026: 1/12/26 – 6/3/26\nFall 2025/Spring 2026: 8/19/25 – 6/3/25\nSummer 2026: 6/4/26 – 1/9/27\nFall 2026: 8/18/26 – 1/9/27\nSpring 2027: 1/11/27 – 6/2/27\nFall 2026/Spring 2027: 8/18/26 – 6/2/27\n\nIf you have questions about the loan itself, contact your lender.\nIf you have an issue with the processing of your private loan, please email us at FinancialAid@mccombs.utexas.edu and include your UT EID and program in your email.\nScholarships\nThere are a limited number of scholarships available to Texas McCombs MS Program students. All Texas McCombs MS Program applicants are automatically considered for these opportunities; no separate application is necessary. Scholarships are considered separately within each degree program.\nPlease note that the McCombs Financial Aid Team does not oversee any other scholarship programs and does not take part in the selection process of Admissions Recruiting Awards. You of course can apply for scholarships from outside organizations. Please refer to scholarship search engines similar to Fastweb or Sallie Mae’s Scholarship Search.\n For students interested in Real Estate, please visit Flash Realty Solution to learn more about their scholarship opportunity.\nTeaching & Work Study\nMS Program students are not typically eligible for university employment as teaching or research assistants. Due to the rigorous nature of the coursework, outside employment is not generally recommended.\n[GRID_TABLE]\nFederal Loans\nIf you are a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, you’ll likely be eligible for federal student loans. To determine your eligibility, you must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid. The FAFSA is available October 1 of each year for the next school year and it is recommended that you have both the current year and next year’s FAFSAs completed no later than June 1st prior to when your program begins. The UT Austin School Code is 003658.\nOnce your FAFSAs have been successfully processed, you will be offered federal loans to cover your full estimated cost of attendance for the summer, fall, and spring semesters.\nYou can check the status of your FAFSA after it has been submitted by visiting the “Status/Requirements” page in your Check Aid Status Here (CASH) portal. We will begin packaging McCombs students’ financial aid in June for the upcoming aid year. If you do not receive a Financial Aid Notification (FAN) by the end of June, please feel free to contact us at FinancialAid@mccombs.utexas.edu.\nInternational Student Options\nAs an international student, you may have loan options available. Better loan terms may be available if you have a U.S. citizen or permanent resident as a co-signer. Though loan terms will likely be less preferable, there are a few lenders that do not require a U.S. cosigner to be approved. We are not able to recommend any lenders specifically and would instead advise doing an internet search to see what options are out there. We will work with all banks and lending institutions.\nWe, as the University of Texas at Austin, cannot be your co-signer.\nThings to keep in mind:\n\nIn additional to program tuition and fees, international students are responsible for international health insurance fees and ISSS fees.\nAll international applicants who plan to enroll at The University of Texas at Austin in F-1 or J-1 status must submit the Certification of Financial Responsibility Form even if they are currently living in the United States. Questions regarding the completion of the form should be directed to: hotline@austin.utexas.edu (please note that the Certification of Financial Responsibility form is used for immigration document processing, not for admissions purposes–therefore, the form is not required for the completion of an admissions application).\nPrivate Loans\nIf you choose to pursue a private loan, we recommend applying no sooner than a few months before the start of your program. Ethically, we cannot recommend a lender; you must do research to find lenders who meet your needs. Most private loans are credit-based, and the approval decision may expire. Check with your lender about the length of time your application will remain valid before you apply.\nWhen applying, you must use loan periods that match what is used by The Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid (OSFA) for processing loans. If your lender provides pre-selected loan periods, we recommend you contact the lender to get the loan periods on your application updated to match what UT Austin uses.\nYou can opt to apply for each semester individually, but you can also group fall and spring together as fall/spring. Summer loans require a separate application and cannot be grouped with any other semester. For example, you cannot have any of the following combinations: summer/fall, spring/summer, summer/fall/spring, or fall/spring/summer.\nPlease use the following loan periods as needed during your time in the program.\nPlease note: academic years (i.e. fall and spring) cannot be grouped together, so you will have to apply for each year separately. Please use the following loan periods as needed based on when your program begins and ends.\n\nSummer 2025: 6/5/25 – 8/18/25\nFall 2025: 8/19/25 – 1/10/26\nSpring 2026: 1/12/26 – 6/3/26\nFall 2025/Spring 2026: 8/19/25 – 6/3/25\nSummer 2026: 6/4/26 – 1/9/27\nFall 2026: 8/18/26 – 1/9/27\nSpring 2027: 1/11/27 – 6/2/27\nFall 2026/Spring 2027: 8/18/26 – 6/2/27\n\nIf you have questions about the loan itself, contact your lender.\nIf you have an issue with the processing of your private loan, please email us at FinancialAid@mccombs.utexas.edu and include your UT EID and program in your email.\nScholarships\nThere are a limited number of scholarships available to Texas McCombs MS Program students.
