Please refer to the ‘How to apply’ section of each programme page. This details which documents you are required to submit with your application and the selection process.\n\n\n\n\n\n          Why do I need to complete a quantitative experience statement?\n          \n\n\nAll of our programmes are academically rigorous and include a quantitative component. Therefore, all candidates are expected to have a basic level of mathematics before the start of the programme. The quantitative experience statement provides an opportunity to demonstrate this to the selection committee.\nIn the quantitative experience statement, you need to list up to five of the most quantitative modules or elements of your studies to date. You should detail:\nThe main topics of study (eg: algebra, probability etc)\nThe level of study (eg: high school, undergraduate degree, short course etc)\nThis will allow the selection committee to have an understanding of your quantitative experience to date.\nQuantitative experience is a key selection criterion for our more quantitative programmes. There are: MSc Finance, MSc Finance & Accounting, MSc Financial Technology, MSc Investment & Wealth Management, MSc Risk Management & Financial Engineering, MSc Business Analytics, MSc Climate Change, Management & Finance and MSc Economics & Strategy for Business.\nPlease check the entry requirements for your programme of interest to ensure your background is sufficiently quantitative. For other programmes, candidates are advised to review the programme content and the pre-study modules. You should check what the numerical content of the programme includes before submitting an application.\n\n\n\n\n\n          How many programmes can I be considered for each year?\n          \n\n\nYou can apply to be considered for one programme each year. We will take your areas of interest and eligibility into account when considering you for alternative programmes.\n\n\n\n\n\n          Do I need to submit evidence of my English language proficiency with my application?\n          \n\n\nIt is not compulsory to submit the results of an approved English language test with your application. However, it is strongly encouraged. It will add weight to your application if you are able to show that you have met the language requirement prior to applying. You can find detailed information regarding the Business School’s language requirements and the tests that we accept here.\n\n\n\n\n\n          How do I submit my qualifications to be verified?\n          \n\n\nTo submit a verification request, you must first create an online account with Qualification Check. You should use the unique link provided to you as part of your offer conditions.\nOnce you have completed the two-step registration process, you will have access to your online account. Search for the name of the institution at which you obtained your qualification(s).\nThen, follow the steps to enter the required information for submission of a verification request. Your details will then be sent to that institution to be authenticated by the appropriate department. Find more information at Qualification Check. \n\n\n\n\n\n          What happens after I submit a request for my qualifications to be verified?\n          \n\n\nQualification Check’s standard procedure is to contact the primary source of the information. This is the institution at which you studied. Qualification Check will regularly contact the relevant department at the institution to confirm the authenticity of your qualifications.\nWe understand that applications are urgent and Qualification Check makes every effort to accommodate your needs and expedite processes. Some institutions may take longer than others. But rest assured that Qualification Check is working hard to complete your verification. Find more information at Qualification Check.\n\n\n\n\n\n          When will my referees be asked to provide a reference?\n          \n\n\nAs part of your application, you will be asked to provide the contact details of two referees. Your referees will be contacted by email once you have completed and submitted your application. The email will contain instructions on how they can submit your reference via our application system.\nPlease ensure that each reference letter that is submitted has been sent from an academic or professional email address. We cannot accept references sent from personal email addresses, such as Gmail, Hotmail, 126, 163, Sina, QQ, and Yahoo.\n\n\n\n\n\n          I’ve received an email confirming that my referees have submitted my references, but this isn’t yet confirmed on my account?\n          \n\n\nOur electronic application service is provided by an external provider. Therefore, there may be a delay before the receipt of your references is confirmed on your student application account.\nIf you receive confirmation that your references have been received but this still isn’t confirmed on your account a week after receiving the confirmation, please contact the Central Admissions team at business.admissions@imperial.ac.uk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Will my decision date be affected by a delay in the approval of my references or missing documentation?\n          \n\n\nIf you submit a complete application by the deadline, you will receive an outcome by the corresponding decision deadline. However, we may be unable to guarantee a decision by the deadline if:\nThere are delays in receiving your references\nThe documentation required to progress your application is missing\nIf the requested information is not received within five working days, we may be unable to guarantee a decision by the round deadline.\n \nIf you have received confirmation that your references have been submitted but this is not reflected in your account after a week, please contact the Central Admissions team at business.admissions@imperial.ac.uk. \n\n\n\n\n\n          Will I be invited to interview?\n          \n\n\nYes. As part of the selection process, shortlisted candidates for our MSc programmes will be invited to complete an interview. Interviews are conducted through Kira Talent, our video interview platform. You can access it online to record and submit your answers.\nThe interview process typically takes about 20 minutes and does not require extensive preparation. It aims to supplement your written application and help you convey your suitability for your chosen Master’s. This will be done through answering questions about your previous experience and future aspirations.\nAI/Chat GPT guidance:\nThe purpose of the interview is to get to know more about you. We want to see how you approach problems, your motivations and wider interests.\nIf we identify malpractice or answers provided are not genuine, then this may factor negatively into the admissions committee decision.\n\n\n\n\n\n          What interview platform do you use, and how will I be notified if I need to complete an online interview?\n          \n\n\nIf you are invited to submit a video interview, you will be sent details of how to access and use the Kira Talent online interview platform.\nOnce you have created an account, you will be asked a series of questions. You can record your answers as short videos and submit them online.\nPlease make sure that the invitation doesn’t go to your junk mail by adding kiratalent.com to your list of safe senders. You must complete your online interview by the deadline stated in the email. We cannot arrange a new interview for you if the email has gone into a junk, spam, or clutter folder in your inbox. Thus, your application will be considered for withdrawal.\nPlease note: our video interviews are conducted via the Kira Talent platform. Kira Talent is an independent third party service provider. They have their own terms and conditions of service and privacy policy.

Please keep in mind that during busy times and/or where documents are missing from an application, this time may increase.\n\n\n\n\n\n          Why is my offer subject to checks by Central Admissions?\n          \n\n\nWhen an offer is submitted by the Business School, the Central Admissions team needs to make a number of final checks before it can be formally approved. These may include:\nAn additional review of an applicant’s academic background\nEnsuring the references we have received are valid\nUntil you have received confirmation of the official offer via Imperial’s applicant portal, please do not:\nArrange accommodation\nBook flights\nDecline any other offers you may be holding\nThe majority of offers are successfully approved by Central Admissions.

We will be in touch via email as soon as there is an update. You do not need to provide any additional information unless you think it will add significant weight to your application. For example, updated transcripts, relevant internships, English language results.\n\n\n\n\n\n          My application has been unsuccessful; can I have some feedback?\n          \n\n\nPlease email your programme Recruitment & Admissions team if you would like feedback on your application. Please note that whilst limited feedback can be provided, the decision of the academic selectors is final. It will not be possible for your application to be reconsidered.\n\n\n\n\n\n          Can I defer my place to next year?\n          \n\n\nIf you receive an offer you can request to defer it to the following year. Requests will be considered until 15th June.\nRequests submitted after 15th June 2025 will only be approved in exceptional circumstances.\nPlease note that you can only defer once.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Can you advise me on my eligibility?\n          \n\n\nWe are unable to assess eligibility before an applicant applies.

In most cases, you will have applied to Imperial well in advance of the start of the course, and our courses run over several years. It is not desirable and can be very difficult to fix all aspects of course delivery so far in advance.\nOne of the particular features of life at Imperial is that our courses are designed to be dynamic and responsive. We also encourage our academics to deliver courses in a manner which reflects their individual style and expertise, consistent with offering a world leading education.\nThis webpage details the limited circumstances in which we may need to make changes to or in relation to our courses, the type of changes we may make and how we will tell you about changes we have made.\nBelow we have set out the types of changes we may need to make to our courses, examples of those changes, and the reasons why we may need to make those changes.\nChanges which go to the heart of the educational experience you receive or which are significantly different to what you were told and what you would have expected when you accepted your place.\nFor legal or regulatory reasons, if there is a compelling academic need to make the change or because we otherwise think the change is necessary and in Imperial’s and/or your best interests.\nChanges which are part of the flexibility inherent to our courses, and which do not go to the heart of the educational experience you will receive; the course will not be significantly different from what you were told or what you would have expected.\nIn addition, to review and enhance the course as part of the College’s normal processes, to improve the services we offer or to operate efficiently.\nWe may need to make changes to our courses before you have accepted your place, after you have accepted your place, and once you have started studying on your course.\nHow we will communicate those changes to you and what course of action is open to you will depend on where you are in the application journey or whether you have already started your course of study.\nInformation in our prospectus and on our website is up to date when it is published, and is designed to be relevant to applicants who are then in the process of applying to study on the course.\nAs explained above, we may need to make certain changes to or in relation to our courses. If we do so, we will try to draw them to your attention, but we are not always aware who will have seen our prospectus or visited our website. As a result, we recommend you check the relevant course pages before finalising your application to ensure no changes have been made.\nIf we have to make any changes after you have been made an offer but before you start on the course, we will provide information on these within the relevant course pages.\nAs part of your preparations for starting at the College, you should regularly check the relevant course pages.\nIn the case of any major change, we will offer you the chance to withdraw from the course if you are unhappy about that change.\nIf you have any questions about changes that have been made to a course that you are holding an offer for, please contact the relevant department to discuss these changes and how they might affect your learning experience.\nIt is unlikely we will make major changes to your course once you have started studying however these types of changes are not always avoidable.\nExceptions include:\nWe will always do what we can to minimise any disruption or inconvenience to you.\nIn the event we have to make a major change, we will:\nIf you are unhappy with the major change, we will try to find a solution you are happy with and will support you, for example by offering you the right to withdraw without penalty, refunding your tuition fees, or allowing you to transfer to a different course.\nMinor changes will take place as part of the natural lifecycle of a course and many are inherent to the successful operation of the courses we offer. They are often unavoidable, for example, when a member of staff leaves. You are therefore expected to adopt a cooperative and flexible approach.\nYou will be told about minor changes which affect your course, but you will not be offered the right to withdraw, a refund, or the right to transfer to a different course as a result of a minor change.\n• Imperial Home\n• Study\n• Apply\n• Course changes\n• Course pages\n• Major changes\n• Minor changes\n• Changes to the course title\n• Changes to the award\n• Significant restructuring of the course\n• Substantial changes in course content\n• Changes to the progression rules\n• Changes to the status of a course (e.g. to accreditation status)\n• Fundamental changes to the learning and teaching strategy (e.g. changing the method of delivery from face-to-face to distance learning)\n• Changes to the primary campus location\n• Suspension or discontinuation of core modules\n• Discontinuation of elective modules\n• Suspension or discontinuation of the course\n• Change of lecturer or other staff\n• Changes to individual module titles\n• Revisions to the content of individual modules to reflect development within the academic discipline and current affairs\n• Changes to enhance the delivery or assessment methods of individual modules\n• Timetabling changes\n• Incidental changes to our facilities\n• Temporary suspension of elective modules\n• Changes after publication of course information, before you apply\n• Changes after you have been made an offer but before you start on the course\n• Major changes once you have started studying on your course\n• Minor changes once you have started studying on your course\n• where we are affected by an event outside of our control\n• where you resit or repeat a year so that you do not complete your studies as expected\n• where we are not able to teach-out the course as planned\n• consult you in advance\n• listen to your views\n• seek your agreement\n[CARD]\nWhat we consider to be a major change\nChanges which go to the heart of the educational experience you receive or which are significantly different to what you were told and what you would have expected when you accepted your place.\nWhy we may need to make major changes\nFor legal or regulatory reasons, if there is a compelling academic need to make the change or because we otherwise think the change is necessary and in Imperial’s and/or your best interests.\nExamples of major changes\n\nChanges to the course title\nChanges to the award\nSignificant restructuring of the course\nSubstantial changes in course content\nChanges to the progression rules\nChanges to the status of a course (e.g. to accreditation status)\nFundamental changes to the learning and teaching strategy (e.g. changing the method of delivery from face-to-face to distance learning)\nChanges to the primary campus location\nSuspension or discontinuation of core modules\nDiscontinuation of elective modules\nSuspension or discontinuation of the course\n[CARD]\nWhat we consider to be a minor change\nChanges which are part of the flexibility inherent to our courses, and which do not go to the heart of the educational experience you will receive; the course will not be significantly different from what you were told or what you would have expected.\nWhy we may need to make minor changes\nFor legal or regulatory reasons, if there is a compelling academic need to make the change or because we otherwise think the change is necessary and in Imperial’s and/or your best interests.\nIn addition, to review and enhance the course as part of the College’s normal processes, to improve the services we offer or to operate efficiently.\nExamples of minor changes\n\nChange of lecturer or other staff\nChanges to individual module titles\nRevisions to the content of individual modules to reflect development within the academic discipline and current affairs\nChanges to enhance the delivery or assessment methods of individual modules\nTimetabling changes\nIncidental changes to our facilities\nTemporary suspension of elective modules\n[CARD]\nInformation in our prospectus and on our website is up to date when it is published, and is designed to be relevant to applicants who are then in the process of applying to study on the course.\nAs explained above, we may need to make certain changes to or in relation to our courses.
