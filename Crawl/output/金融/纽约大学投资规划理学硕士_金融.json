Students will be eligible to take the CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNERTM certification examination upon completion of their coursework.\nFinancial planning is the comprehensive process of helping individuals and families meet their lifetime financial goals through the proper management of their financial resources. Currently, financial planning is growing at a rate faster than many other industries. An increased number of financial planners will be necessary to meet the growing demand for future jobs in the industry, which is ranked 23rd by market size and is the 179th largest in the United States according to US News & World Report.\nFinancial planning professionals are trained and hired by clients to gather the necessary information to assess the clients’ financial situation, identify their financial goals and objectives, develop recommendations, communicate and implement those recommendations, and provide a written plan for continuous monitoring. Studies show that individuals who use the services of a comprehensive financial planner tend to do better financially.\nThe industry is faced with an aging workforce since 56% of financial planners are over the age of 50. Opportunities for individuals who want to build a lucrative and promising career in the industry have never been greater. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual salary for a financial advisor in 2018 was $88,980 nationally, and in New York, the average annual salary was $164,260.\nThis 30-credit financial planning master's degree, offered by the NYU SPS Division of Programs in Business, is certified by the Certified Financial Planner (CFP®) Board of Standards. This education prepares students with critical thinking, financial analysis, and investing skills for financial advising and services positions in private practice, banks, investment firms, non-profit organizations, and wealth management firms.\nThe Master of Science in Financial Planning is housed in the School of Professional Studies (SPS) at NYU. SPS has a long history of training students in applied disciplines where the emphasis is on providing them with the knowledge, hands-on experience, and the development of job skills pertinent to the industry, thus graduating the kind of students that employers seek to recruit.\nFinancial planning students can be expected to take courses in financial planning and risk management, investments and wealth management, income tax strategies, retirement planning strategies, estate planning, research applications, and a comprehensive capstone course, which combines all the areas of financial planning. \n\nIn addition, students will be able to choose an area of concentration. Students that want to work directly with clients can take courses in behavioral finance, while those who wish to work in a more data-driven financial planning role can take courses in financial analytics. Students may be able to secure internship opportunities for practical experience.\nOne of the best things about a career in financial planning is the flexibility it offers. Many financial planners become entrepreneurs and establish their own practices; this affords the planners the most flexibility and control over their careers. Many others decide to work for a financial planning firm where they can interact directly with clients or in a research or analytics capacity. Others may wish to work for large financial service organizations or banks.\nFinancial planning has a direct impact on people’s lives by transforming their financial health. It is about helping individuals and families achieve financial well-being and helping people get out of debt, send their children to college, or retire comfortably. A career as a financial advisor was rated number nine by US News and World Report in their Best Business Jobs survey.

In order to conduct a complete and holistic review of an application, the Office of Admissions needs to evaluate transcripts from all institutions previously attended.\nDo I need to submit a foreign transcript evaluation?\n\nInternational applicants who completed more than half of their academic program at a foreign university are required to submit an evaluation. Evaluations are a required component since they determine how your academics are graded compared to the US education system, as well as if your degree is equivalent to a US bachelor’s degree.\nWhen requesting an evaluation, please request a “course-by-course evaluation.” All transcripts must be evaluated by a recognized foreign educational credential evaluation from the list below.\n\nEducational Credential Evaluators (ECE)\nEducational Perspectives, npf\nForeign Academic Credential Service\nTranscript Research\nThe Evaluation Company (TEC)\nWorld Education Services (WES)\nWho should submit a recommendation on my behalf?\n\nRecommendations must come from either academic or professional sources. This could include supervisors, managers, former professors, program directors, etc. We encourage you to share some information with your recommendation providers about the program to which you are applying, so they can tailor their recommendation appropriately. We strongly recommend that you provide your recommender’s professional or academic email address when requesting your letters.\n\nHow to Submit a Letter of Recommendation\nHow does my recommender submit a recommendation on my behalf?\n\nYour recommender will be required to submit a recommendation using the online submission form found within the application portal. You will need to input their email address in the recommendation section of your application and your recommender will automatically receive an email from NYU containing a link and instructions on how to submit the online recommendation.\n\nHow to Submit a Letter of Recommendation\nMust all of my recommendation providers submit their letters online?\n\nYes. The Admissions Office asks that you use the online application portal to input your recommendation provider's information and request that they submit their letters electronically. It is the most efficient and timely way to facilitate the processing of your application.\n\nHow to Submit a Letter of Recommendation\nShould I wait to submit my application until all recommendations are complete?\n\nNo. You may submit your application as soon as you have completed it. The letters of recommendation will be automatically added to your application once your recommenders have completed the online recommendation form.\nDo I have to submit GRE or GMAT scores as part of my application?\n\nThe GRE and GMAT are not required to apply for our graduate degree programs.\nWhat is the school code for submitting standardized exams?\n\nStandardized test scores from ETS (TOEFL scores) can be uploaded directly into the online application or sent to us using our school code, 2557. You may select 01 for graduate management. Official IELTS scores can be sent by contacting your test center directly and request that your test scores be sent electronically to New York University, School of Professional Studies. An institutional code is not required.\nDo I need to submit TOEFL/IELTS scores with my application?\n\nApplicants who did not complete an undergraduate or graduate degree in the United States or in a program where the medium of instruction is English are required to submit TOEFL or IELTS scores. The Office of Admissions will not accept TOEFL or IELTS scores that are older than two years.\nCan I request a waiver for the English Language Proficiency Requirements?\n\nA TOEFL or IELTS waiver may be requested for the following reasons:\n\nIf an official letter is submitted by the institution stating all classes were conducted in English. Please upload this letter directly to your application along with your transcripts.\nIf it is stated on the academic transcript or school website that all classes are conducted in English.\nIf a graduate degree was conducted in English or the institution is in a country where English is the only primary language.\nIf the applicant completed 3 years of undergraduate studies at an institution where English is the medium of instruction and 1 year at their international institution.\n\n A TOEFL/IELTS waiver can only be granted after the submission of your application.\nWhat is the Video and Writing Reflection?\n\nThe Video and Writing Reflection - Powered by Kira Talent, is an online assessment tool designed to evaluate video questions and written assessments. This assessment allows the Admissions Committee to analyze skills we value such as collaboration and global-mindedness, integrity, critical and analytical thinking skills, and effective written and oral communication. The Kira assessment incorporates various components to evaluate applicants, including 1 video question and a timed writing activity.\nDuring the online assessment, you will be asked a series of questions, given prep time, and a set amount of time to respond. The assessment is brief and will take 20 to 30 minutes to complete.\n\nVideo & Written Reflection Explained\nWhen should I register for the Video and Writing Reflection?\n\nTo expedite the processing of your application, we recommend that applicants register and complete the Kira assessment promptly upon creating their graduate application. The Kira Assessment link can take 24–48 hours to appear in your application.\nHow long does it take to complete the Video and Writing Reflection?\n\nThe assessment is brief and will only take you 20–30 minutes to complete. The system allows for unlimited practice sessions but once you start the formal interview questions, you only get one chance. This allows us to capture your candid responses.\nWhen does Admissions receive my Video and Writing Reflection score?\n\nIt typically takes 3-4 weeks for the Admissions Office to receive the score.\nHelp! I’m having technical difficulties during the Video and Writing Reflection.\n\nIf you have any questions, or cannot complete Kira, please email support@kiratalent.com.\nWhat technology will I need to complete the Video and Writing Reflection?\n\nTo complete this requirement, you will need a desktop or laptop computer with a functioning webcam, microphone, and internet connection.\nI didn’t prepare for the Video and Writing Reflection. Can I retake it?\n\nApplicants may not retake the Kira. The questions asked on the Kira assessment are meant to be candid responses to allow us to understand your critical thinking skills through spontaneous answers.\nCan I defer my enrollment if offered admission?\n\nIf you are accepted, you may have the option to defer your enrollment directly through the online enrollment form. You will be given the option to defer your enrollment for up to one year from your original acceptance term. Please note that deferrals are typically only granted based on significant, extenuating circumstances.\nCan I reapply if my application is denied?\n\nStudents who have been denied admission will not be permitted to reapply to any program at the School of Professional Studies for one academic year—this includes applying as a non-matriculant student.\nHow do I confirm my decision to enroll?\n\nTo reserve your place in the program, please complete the online enrollment form (Reply Form) accessible via your acceptance letter.\nHow do I submit my tuition deposit?\n\nAs noted on your acceptance message, the tuition deposit is non-refundable and will be applied to your first term's tuition when you enroll. Your acceptance is only final once we receive your non-refundable deposit. The preferred methods of payment are credit card or electronic check.\nIf those options are not available to you, you may mail your tuition check or money order by your deposit deadline payable to  \"New York University\" at the following address:\nNYU BURSAR OFFICE\n383 Lafayette St\nNew York, NY 10003\nATTN: Tuition Deposit\nThe check or money order must be in US funds only; be sure to include your University ID number and Enrollment Term in the memo section.\nHow do I apply for an I-20?\n\nOnce you have activated your NetID, you will be able to complete the I-20 request form on the student portal. If you need assistance with the process, you should contact the NYU Office of Global Services (OGS) directly.\nWhere can I find my Net ID?\n\nTo obtain and activate your NetID, visit NYU Start. If you encounter difficulty in activating your NetID, contact the Help Desk for technical assistance at AskITS@nyu.edu or 212-998-3333.\nI have been accepted for a degree I no longer want. Can I change my program?\n\nYou may request a program change, however, we highly encourage you to first speak with your current academic advisor to discuss your academic and career goals. NYU SPS graduate programs are highly specialized degrees and when applicants submit their initial application they are expected to understand how the degree aligns with their academic and professional goals.\nIf you choose to move forward with a program change application, please note that this is not an automatic admission to the new program and your request may be accepted or denied. If your program change is approved, you will receive an email confirming the approved change. If, however, your change of program application is denied, you will have the choice to enroll in your initial degree program. The Admissions Committee will re-review your master’s degree application, based on your new program of choice. Please allow 3-4 weeks for this new application to be reviewed and processed. Please complete the program change application and submit it to the Admissions Office at sps.admissions@nyu.edu.\nNote that program changes through the NYU SPS Office of Admissions are for new students only. If you have completed any coursework towards an SPS degree, please contact your academic adviser for additional information regarding program changes as a current student.\n[GRID_TABLE]\n96%\n\n\nworking or in school in 6 months [1]\nworking or in school in 6 months [1]\nworking or in school in 6 months [1]\n$76K\n\n\nmean starting salary of master’s graduates [1]\nmean starting salary of master’s graduates [1]\nmean starting salary of master’s graduates [1]\n19%\n\n\nof master’s students attend part-time\nof master’s students attend part-time\nof master’s students attend part-time\n44%\n\n\nmaster’s students taking at least some classes online [2]\nmaster’s students taking at least some classes online [2]\nmaster’s students taking at least some classes online [2]\n62%\n\n\ninternational students\ninternational students\ninternational students\n[CARD]\nFall 2025 - Open\nROUND\n[CARD]\nSpring 2026 - Open\nROUND\n[CARD]\nSummer 2026 - Application Opens August 2025\nROUND\n[CARD]\nFall 2026 - Application Opens August 2025\nROUND\n[CARD]\nDAUS Instant Decision Day\n[CARD]\nUndergraduate Information Session\n[CARD]\nGraduate Studies Information Session\n[CARD]\n$26,502\nper term for full-time (10-12 credits)\n[CARD]\n$26,502\n[CARD]\nper term for full-time (10-12 credits)\n[CARD]\n$2,575\nper credit for part-time\n[CARD]\n$2,575\n[CARD]\nper credit for part-time\n[CARD]\nFor me, it’s about embracing different cultures and thriving in unfamiliar environments while finding inspiration in every journey.”\n[CARD]\nThe master's program helped me learn more about real-life scenarios that could happen for events as small as 100 people and as big as 10,000.\"\n[CARD]\nNYU has name-brand recognition amongst many employers.\"\n[CARD]\nEmbrace every opportunity and challenge with an open mind and a full heart.\"\n[CARD]\nHave a Question?\nHave a Question?\nNot sure where to begin, want more information, or need help completing your application?
