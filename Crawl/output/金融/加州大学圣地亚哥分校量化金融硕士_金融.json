The Rady MQF program has sent alumni to PhD programs at UC San Diego, Stanford, Duke, University of Chicago, Columbia, and Princeton.\nThe new name will more accurately reflect the quantitative content of the coursework and the sought-after skills students develop in the program.  While the name will be changing, the core curriculum and objectives of the program remain the same. The Master of Quantitative Finance remains a STEM-designated degree that can be completed in 12 or 15 months, and will prepare students to apply state-of-the-art quantitative analysis to the large and often multiple real-time data sets that drive financial decision making and risk management.\nThe proposed name change is pending final approval from the University of California system. It is anticipated that incoming Fall 2024 students will begin the program under the Master of Quantitative Finance degree name.\nWork experience is not required for the Master of Quantitative Finance program, but is recommended. If you do not have work experience, we will want to understand why you believe now is the right time for you to pursue the Master of Quantitative Finance degree, and we will expect to see excellent academic records, relevant undergraduate internships, extracurricular activities, etc.\nBusiness coursework or work experience is not required for the Master of Quantitative Finance program.\nThe Master of Quantitative Finance curriculum emphasizes both the mathematical foundations for financial decision-making and computer-driven data analysis. Many applicants will be stronger in one of these areas than the other. Applicants with strength in one area can be successful in admissions and then will develop additional skills in the program.\nThere is no minimum requirement; however, we will be looking particularly at the strength of your performance in the quantitative sections. Strong scores may serve to balance lower undergraduate academic performance and are good predictors of how well students will do in the required core classes. GMAT or GRE scores in one sitting are evaluated, not averaged from multiple sittings.\nThe Rady School welcomes applications from undergraduates who have excelled academically and personally and who can articulate their reasons for continuing directly to the Master of Quantitative Finance program. Undergraduate majors in quantitative, engineering or technical disciplines are particularly relevant, but these are by no means the only majors we consider. Please contact the Rady Master of Quantitative Finance Admissions Office for more information.\nThe Rady School welcomes applications from individuals who have already completed advanced study in science, engineering, technology, or other quantitative disciplines.\nThe Master of Quantitative Finance curriculum emphasizes both mathematical foundations for financial decision-making and computer driven data analysis. Applicants should have an understanding of linear algebra, specifically matrix manipulation, and differential calculus and taking derivatives. It is also recommended to have some exposure to programming or computational tools such as Python, MATLAB, C/C++, etc.  Admitted applicants who enroll into the Master of Quantitative Finance will be required to complete pre-arrival Python courses on DataCamp.com before the start of the program in September.\nExplore by Program\nFull-Time MBA\nPart-Time MBA (FlexEvening)\nExecutive MBA\nMaster of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA)\nMaster of Professional Accountancy (MPAc)\nMaster of Quantitative Finance (MQF)\nUndergraduate Programs\nExecutive Education\nCurrent Students\nDonors & Investors\nMilitary/Veterans\nCompanies and Recruiters\nContact Admissions\nSchedule a Visit\nUpcoming Events\nRequest Information\nTake a Virtual Tour\nMaps & Directions\nPartner with Rady\n• Search\n\nThis Site\nAll UCSD Sites\nFaculty/Staff\n\n\nSearch Term\n• Why Rady  \n\nBusiness is a Science\nDean’s Office\nRady Stats\nUC San Diego's Business School\n20th Anniversary\nCareer Impact\nStudent Experience\nCenters of Excellence\nOur Partnership With San Diego\nEquity Diversity, and Inclusion\nRady News\n• Business is a Science\n• Dean’s Office\n• Rady Stats\n• UC San Diego's Business School\n• 20th Anniversary\n• Career Impact\n• Student Experience\n• Centers of Excellence\n• Our Partnership With San Diego\n• Equity Diversity, and Inclusion\n• Rady News\n• Programs  \n\nExplore by Program\nFull-Time MBA\n Part-Time MBA (FlexEvening)\nExecutive MBA\nMaster of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA)\nMaster of Quantitative Finance (MQF)\nMaster of Professional Accountancy (MPAc)\nPh.D. Program\nUndergraduate Programs\nExecutive Education\n• Explore by Program\n• Full-Time MBA\n• Part-Time MBA (FlexEvening)\n• Executive MBA\n• Master of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA)\n• Master of Quantitative Finance (MQF)\n• Master of Professional Accountancy (MPAc)\n• Ph.D. Program\n• Undergraduate Programs\n• Executive Education\n• Faculty & Research  \n\nFaculty & Research Overview\nResearch Faculty\nProgram Directors\nOther Faculty\nWhat We Are Working On\nResearch\nResearch Seminars\nFaculty Recruitment\n• Faculty & Research Overview\n• Research Faculty\n• Program Directors\n• Other Faculty\n• What We Are Working On\n• Research\n• Research Seminars\n• Faculty Recruitment\n• Partner With Rady  \n\nWorkforce Development\nRecruit Rady Talent\nCapstone Projects\nCustom Executive Education\n• Workforce Development\n• Recruit Rady Talent\n• Capstone Projects\n• Custom Executive Education\n• Connect  \n\nConnect with us\nUpcoming Events\nRequest Information\nVenue Rental\nVisit Rady\nTake a Virtual Tour\nApply Now\n• Connect with us\n• Upcoming Events\n• Request Information\n• Venue Rental\n• Visit Rady\n• Take a Virtual Tour\n• Apply Now\n• Info For  \n\nIncoming Rady Students\nCurrent Students\nStaff\nDonors\nMilitary\nPress\nOther\n• Incoming Rady Students\n• Current Students\n• Staff\n• Donors\n• Military\n• Press\n• Other\n• Alumni  \n\nAlumni Reunion Weekend 2025\nRady Alumni\nJoin the Rady Network\nCareer Development\nGet Involved\nOur Board\n• Alumni Reunion Weekend 2025\n• Rady Alumni\n• Join the Rady Network\n• Career Development\n• Get Involved\n• Our Board\n• Business is a Science\n• Dean’s Office\n• Rady Stats\n• UC San Diego's Business School\n• 20th Anniversary\n• Career Impact\n• Student Experience\n• Centers of Excellence\n• Our Partnership With San Diego\n• Equity Diversity, and Inclusion\n• Rady News\n• Explore by Program\n• Full-Time MBA\n• Part-Time MBA (FlexEvening)\n• Executive MBA\n• Master of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA)\n• Master of Quantitative Finance (MQF)\n• Master of Professional Accountancy (MPAc)\n• Ph.D. Program\n• Undergraduate Programs\n• Executive Education\n• Faculty & Research Overview\n• Research Faculty\n• Program Directors\n• Other Faculty\n• What We Are Working On\n• Research\n• Research Seminars\n• Faculty Recruitment\n• Workforce Development\n• Recruit Rady Talent\n• Capstone Projects\n• Custom Executive Education\n• Connect with us\n• Upcoming Events\n• Request Information\n• Venue Rental\n• Visit Rady\n• Take a Virtual Tour\n• Apply Now\n• Incoming Rady Students\n• Current Students\n• Staff\n• Donors\n• Military\n• Press\n• Other\n• Alumni Reunion Weekend 2025\n• Rady Alumni\n• Join the Rady Network\n• Career Development\n• Get Involved\n• Our Board\n• HOME\n• Programs\n• Master of Quantitative Finance (MQF)\n• MQF Program FAQs\n• A regionally accredited U.S. college or university where English is the sole language of instruction, or\n• A foreign college or university which provides instruction solely in English.

It is anticipated that incoming Fall 2024 students will begin the program under the Master of Quantitative Finance degree name.\n \n\n\nCan I apply to multiple programs at the Rady School of Management at the same time?\n\n\nUC San Diego and the Rady School of Management permit only one submitted application at a time to any Rady School graduate degree programs.  If you’re unsure which program best aligns with your background and career goals, our admissions team is available to help you.  If you have started, submitted, or received an admissions decision from one program but decide to apply to another, please reach out to the admissions team for guidance.  If multiple applications are submitted at the same time, neither application will be reviewed until a first-choice preference is made by the applicant.\n\nPlease note that the application fee is nonrefundable. In cases where multiple applications are submitted, any fee paid for an application that is not reviewed will not be refunded.\n\n\nCan the application fee be waived?\n\n\nThe Rady School of Management does not offer application fee waivers upon request. Application fee waivers are made available to prospective applicants at select in-person and virtual recruitment events. Prospective students are advised to attend those admission events that are of interest to them.  Should it be pre-approved for an application fee waiver, attendees will be notified during the event.\n\nThe Rady School of Management is proud to offer pre-approval of application fee waivers to select populations, including active-duty and veteran members of the military; applicants affiliated with the Peace Corps, Teach for American, or AmeriCorps; SIEML and CaLI alumni; and MPAc Junior Applicants with approved Conditional Nomination.  Qualifying applicants should inform the Rady Graduate Admissions at RadyGradAdmissions@ucsd.edu prior to submitting their application for assistance with the fee waiver.\n\nApplication fees paid before an application fee waiver has been approved and/or applied will not be refunded.\n\n\n\n\nProgram Eligibility\n\n\n\nI will complete my bachelor's degree in the spring and will not have any professional work experience. Will you consider my application for admission to the Master of Quantitative Finance?\n\n\nWork experience is not required for the Master of Quantitative Finance program, but is recommended. If you do not have work experience, we will want to understand why you believe now is the right time for you to pursue the Master of Quantitative Finance degree, and we will expect to see excellent academic records, relevant undergraduate internships, extracurricular activities, etc.\n\n\nDo I need a business background to apply to the program?\n\n\nBusiness coursework or work experience is not required for the Master of Quantitative Finance program.\n\n\nI have some quantitative or computing background, but not in all the areas listed. Can I apply to and be successful in the program?\n\n\nThe Master of Quantitative Finance curriculum emphasizes both the mathematical foundations for financial decision-making and computer-driven data analysis. Many applicants will be stronger in one of these areas than the other. Applicants with strength in one area can be successful in admissions and then will develop additional skills in the program.\n\n\nWhat are the minimum GMAT or GRE scores for the Rady Master of Quantitative Finance program?\n\n\nThere is no minimum requirement; however, we will be looking particularly at the strength of your performance in the quantitative sections. Strong scores may serve to balance lower undergraduate academic performance and are good predictors of how well students will do in the required core classes. GMAT or GRE scores in one sitting are evaluated, not averaged from multiple sittings.\n\n\nI'm a college senior. Am I eligible to apply to the Master of Quantitative Finance program?\n\n\nThe Rady School welcomes applications from undergraduates who have excelled academically and personally and who can articulate their reasons for continuing directly to the Master of Quantitative Finance program. Undergraduate majors in quantitative, engineering or technical disciplines are particularly relevant, but these are by no means the only majors we consider. Please contact the Rady Master of Quantitative Finance Admissions Office for more information.\n\n\nDoes the Rady School accept students with advanced degrees?\n\n\nThe Rady School welcomes applications from individuals who have already completed advanced study in science, engineering, technology, or other quantitative disciplines.\n\n\nWhat are the knowledge prerequisites for the Rady Master of Quantitative Finance program?\n\n\nThe Master of Quantitative Finance curriculum emphasizes both mathematical foundations for financial decision-making and computer driven data analysis. Applicants should have an understanding of linear algebra, specifically matrix manipulation, and differential calculus and taking derivatives. It is also recommended to have some exposure to programming or computational tools such as Python, MATLAB, C/C++, etc.  Admitted applicants who enroll into the Master of Quantitative Finance will be required to complete pre-arrival Python courses on DataCamp.com before the start of the program in September.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPROGRAMS\nExplore by Program\nFull-Time MBA\nPart-Time MBA (FlexEvening)\nExecutive MBA\nMaster of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA)\nMaster of Professional Accountancy (MPAc)\nMaster of Quantitative Finance (MQF)\nPh.D.\nUndergraduate Programs\nExecutive Education\n\n\nINFO FOR\nCurrent Students\nStaff\nDonors & Investors\nMilitary/Veterans\nCompanies and Recruiters\nPress\nAlumni\n\n\nCONTACT\nContact Admissions\nSchedule a Visit\nUpcoming Events\nRequest Information\nTake a Virtual Tour\nMaps & Directions\nPartner with Rady\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\nApply Give\n\nAnnual Security and Fire Safety Report\nOpen Staff Positions\nPROGRAMS\nExplore by Program\nFull-Time MBA\nPart-Time MBA (FlexEvening)\nExecutive MBA\nMaster of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA)\nMaster of Professional Accountancy (MPAc)\nMaster of Quantitative Finance (MQF)\nPh.D.\nUndergraduate Programs\nExecutive Education\nINFO FOR\nCurrent Students\nStaff\nDonors & Investors\nMilitary/Veterans\nCompanies and Recruiters\nPress\nAlumni\nCONTACT\nContact Admissions\nSchedule a Visit\nUpcoming Events\nRequest Information\nTake a Virtual Tour\nMaps & Directions\nPartner with Rady\nMaster of Quantitative Finance (MQF)\n\n\n\n\n                Stats & Stories\n            \n\n\n\n                Academics\n            \n\n\n\n                Career Impact\n            \n\n\n\n                Student Experience\n            \n\n\n\n                Admissions\n            \n\n\n\n                Tuition & Aid\n            \n\n\n                    Program FAQs\n            \n\n\n                MQF Industry Partnerships\n            \n\n\n\n                Request Information\n            \n\n\n\n                Apply\nAcademics\nAdmissions\n[GRID_TABLE]\nPROGRAMS\nExplore by Program\nFull-Time MBA\nPart-Time MBA (FlexEvening)\nExecutive MBA\nMaster of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA)\nMaster of Professional Accountancy (MPAc)\nMaster of Quantitative Finance (MQF)\nPh.D.\nUndergraduate Programs\nExecutive Education\nINFO FOR\nCurrent Students\nStaff\nDonors & Investors\nMilitary/Veterans\nCompanies and Recruiters\nPress\nAlumni\nCONTACT\nContact Admissions\nSchedule a Visit\nUpcoming Events\nRequest Information\nTake a Virtual Tour\nMaps & Directions\nPartner with Rady\n[GRID_TABLE]\nAcademics\nAdmissions",

The Rady Admissions team takes a holistic approach to reviewing all applicants and in recruiting a cohort that reflects academic excellence, innovation, diverse perspectives and hard work. We encourage you to explore the application process, meet our advisors, and to take the time to put together a high quality application that reflects you and your career aspirations. This is your opportunity to invest in yourself and make the impact you want to have on the world.\nWhile most applicants have undergraduate degrees in finance, economics, engineering, computer science, mathematics, physics, or statistics, other majors will also be considered. Post-university work, internships, or research experience in a quantitative discipline is also considered.\nCandidates are required to submit an official GMAT or GRE score. A free GMAT Mini-Quiz is available for you to get a feel for the examination.\nA strong quantitative background is required, as evidenced by a high quantitative score on the GRE or GMAT.\nExperience with statistical applications and programming is favorably considered (Examples: Python, SAS, STATA, MatLab, R, S-Plus). If you are new to Python we recommend you also complete a course on programming in Python from Data Camp or Coursera.\nContact us for information on upcoming deadlines.\nAll admitted students who enroll in the Master of Quantitative Finance program are expected to arrive to campus in time for the required orientation. Orientation begins in mid-September 2025.\nFor international applicants ONLY:  http://grad.ucsd.edu/admissions/requirements/international-applicants/records-transcripts.html — All international transcripts require an official translation into English by a certified translator. International applicants must submit a certified copy of their diploma indicating the degree received.\nAll admitted, international applicants are required to complete and submit a WES Course-by-Course evaluation. Please go to wes.org to create your account. You will be prompted to input your academic history, and will then be provided with a list of documents required for the completion of your evaluation. Applicants with academic work in progress who expect to complete a degree program before the intended date of enrollment at UCSD must provide evidence of degree conferral and a final academic transcript as soon as they are available.\nPlease do not send official documents to the Graduate Admissions Office. As an international applicant, you must submit a WES Course-by-Course evaluation via WES once you have been admitted for your admission to UC San Diego to be finalized.\nYour Statement of Purpose should be no longer than 500 words, double-spaced, 12-point font. Tell us why you think that you are a good candidate for the Master of Quantitative Finance program and how you expect the specific features of the program at Rady to benefit your future career.\nPlease also include any other information, academic or personal, that you feel is important for the Admissions Committee to consider.\nThe Rady Admissions Office encourages all applicants to prepare appropriately for these examinations. Study can be done individually, in classroom environments, or online.

Rady faculty are prominent scholars in the fields of finance, behavioral economics, innovation, technology and operations management, marketing, organizational strategy and psychology. The curriculum is designed to be extensive, flexible and personalized, in a self-directed research environment.\nThe Rady Ph.D. program builds upon UC San Diego’s reputation and lineage, which includes 16 Nobel Laureates (former and current faculty) and eight MacArthur Foundation award recipients. We invite you to discuss the opportunities offered by the Rady program with our expert faculty.\nIf you have any questions, please contact the Rady Ph.D. Graduate Coordinator at radyphd@ucsd.edu.\nData from the AACSB indicates that the U.S. shortage of business Ph.D.s is expected to be over 1,000 in five years and nearly 2,500 in 10 years, both in the academic and corporate fields. Graduates with the right background, motivation, ability and training have the opportunity to become the next generation of professors at the world's elite business schools.\nThe Rady Ph.D. program combines faculty expertise, intimate size, strong interdisciplinary training and a desirable location for highly qualified doctoral candidates. The program has a strong research orientation, along with personal attention and mentoring from world-class faculty.\nThe program is a full-time course of study, designed primarily to prepare candidates for an academic career.
