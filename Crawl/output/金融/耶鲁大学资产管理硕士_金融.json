The admissions committee has no preference between the two exams, and we are well-versed in evaluating scores from each. When completing this section of your application, you only need to list your two highest scores to-date. Applicants are required to send official scores from the testing agency by the Post-Submission Materials Deadline.\nApplicants can send official score reports at any time directly to the Yale School of Management Master's in Asset Management. You can request official GMAT scores through www.mba.com (search for Yale School of Management and select the “Master of Management Science – Asset Management” option). Send official GRE scores through www.ets.org (code 4548). Yale SOM has multiple GMAT and GRE codes. Be sure to send your scores to the codes above, which correspond to the Yale SOM Asset Management program.\nAll test scores (online or in-person GMAT and GRE) must be less than five years old, measured from the date you submit your application. For example, if you are applying with a test score from January 7, 2020, you can submit your application using this test score until January 6, 2025, but you also need to order those official scores to be sent to SOM before January 7, 2025. If you took the exam within the past five years and have designated Yale SOM as a score report recipient, we will have access to all of your GMAT and/or GRE scores from that period. If your score will soon become five years old, please send them well before they age out.\nCurrent Yale College seniors with a GPA of 3.7 or above, and Yale College alumni within three years of graduation with a cumulative GPA of 3.7 or above, are exempt from the GMAT/GRE test requirement.\nIf your native language is not English and you have not completed a degree in an English-speaking country, we require the submission of TOEFL, DET, or IELTS test scores.\nApplicants studying in countries or territories that list English as an official language, such as India, Pakistan, Hong Kong S.A.R., or Singapore are still required to submit an English language test; however, this requirement may be waived if the applicant completed a bachelor’s, master’s, or doctoral degree from an institution in which all instruction is conducted in English. Education in English-medium institutions in other countries or territories does not qualify for the exemption.\nAll test scores must be less than two years old, measured from the date you submit your application. For example, if you are applying with a test score from January 5, 2023, you must submit your application by no later than January 4, 2025 if you would like this score to be considered.\nApplicants are required to send official scores from the testing agency by the Post-Submission Materials Deadline. You can request TOEFL score reports through www.toefl.org (code C472), Duolingo English Test (DET) score reports through https://englishtest.duolingo.com/applicants (search Yale School of Management Master's in Asset Management), and IELTS score reports through www.ielts.org (no code required).\nAs part of your application, you will be asked to provide transcripts for all undergraduate, graduate, study abroad, transfer and non-degree programs you have attended and for which you were issued university-level course credit.  Professional and personal development activities not taken for university-level credit, such as CPA, CFA, and online classes for which you did not receive course credit, do not require transcripts.\nYou do not need to submit official transcripts when you apply, but you should submit either a copy of a physical transcript (which should appear on school letterhead and contain all available pages) or an electronic transcript (which should appear in the electronic format provided by the school that most closely replicates the format and information provided in a physical transcript with classes appearing in chronological order). Transcripts should clearly show the name of the institution, all course descriptions, and grades. Submit all available pages of each transcript, including pages that detail your institution's grading scale. We will require official transcripts once you enroll at Yale SOM; all offers of admission are conditional until the official transcripts and degree certifications are received and verified.\nIf your transcript is not in English, we request both a copy of the original untranslated transcript as well as a notarized English translation.\nIf your degree-granting university transcript includes any study abroad work or transfer credits, you’ll need to submit a separate transcript from the institution where those courses were completed.  The only exception is if your degree-granting university includes the full course names and grades (not pass/fail) for your study abroad or transfer credits; in this case, you do not need to submit a separate transcript from the institution where those courses were completed.\nIf you are currently a student, your transcript must reflect grades and GPA (if applicable) through the end of the most recently completed semester (typically Fall 2024). If these grades are not available at the time of your application, you must submit an updated transcript through the form on your Application Status Page as soon as your grades become available.\nApplicants to the Master's in Asset Management program will upload a résumé that details professional and academic background, including any internships or full-time employment. Include activities and interests that are relevant to your application, highlighting any leadership or team-based roles you have undertaken. A strong résumé will contextualize past academic and professional accomplishments that will help you succeed in the Master's in Asset Management program and in your future career.\nThe Master's in Asset Management admissions committee would like to get to know you better through your response to the following question:\nWhat are your short and long term career interests? Please describe what drives these interests and how they connect to your academic, professional, or personal experiences.\nThe essay has a 500 word limit, though candidates do not need to meet this limit, and are encouraged to answer the prompt concisely.\nWe require two letters of recommendation. One of the recommenders must be in a position to assess your performance in a university setting, such as a professor or academic mentor. The second recommendation must be from a professional or extracurricular supervisor or another individual who has worked with you in an applied setting (such as an internship, full-time work experience, research, or long-term academic project). We highly recommend securing a recommendation from what you consider to be your most significant professional or applied experience.\nWhile all letters must be written in English, we encourage you to find recommenders who can best speak to your past experiences, regardless of their English language fluency. We will evaluate only the substance of the recommendations, not the proficiency of the language used therein. Your recommenders may choose to write their letters in English or to write in their native language and use one of many free translation programs available.\nApplicants to the Yale SOM Asset Management program will be assessed an application fee of $95. You will pay the fee with a credit card directly after submitting your application form.\nYale SOM waives the application fee for members of the following groups:\nWithin the Yale SOM application, you can request a fee waiver if you meet any of these criteria. We ask students requesting  a fee waiver to do so at least 48 hours before the application deadline.\nAfter you submit your application and pay the application fee, you will receive access to the assessment within your application status portal. The exercise will be recorded through a system called Kira. You will have the opportunity to answer non-recorded practice questions before moving on to your recorded questions. Once you are ready to begin the assessment, the first two questions will require short verbal responses. The third and final question will require a written response, typed into a textbox within the Kira system.\nYou will receive a randomized set of questions. The questions asked are similar to  typical interview questions and there are no “trick questions.” This exercise is not a substitute for the interview; it is one component of your application. You will not have the chance to change your responses.\nWe suggest completing this exercise in a quiet space. You will need a strong, high-speed internet connection. You must use a desktop or laptop computer; the system will not allow you to use a mobile device.\nAfter you submit your application and pay the application fee, you will receive access to the assessment within your application status portal. The Behavioral Assessment is an online admissions tool administered by the research division of ETS, which measures a set of interpersonal and intrapersonal competencies associated with business school success. It is a forced-choice module that takes about 25 minutes to complete, and should be completed in a single sitting. Applicants do not need to do anything in advance to prepare for the assessment, nor does it require any specialized knowledge, background, or information to complete.\nInterviews are offered by invitation on a rolling basis throughout the admissions cycle and are 30 minutes in length. You will be contacted via email if invited to interview.\nReapplicants are required to submit a new application, upload new essays (including a reapplicant essay), pay the application fee, and complete the video questions and Behavioral Assessment. If you have applied within the last two years, you are not required to submit new transcripts (unless they contain new information since your previous application) or a new test score report, unless improvements have been made that you would like the Admissions Committee to note.\nYour circumstances may have changed in the year since you last applied, and you may decide to request new letters of recommendation. However, if you wish to use one or both letters from your previous application, please email us and let us know which letter you would like us to reattach in support of your new application file.\nIf you are reapplying, the Admissions Committee will look to understand what has changed about your candidacy since your last application. Therefore, we suggest you reapply only when you have had enough time to reflect on your candidacy and can provide meaningful updates.\nReview frequently asked questions on admissions requirements and the admissions process.\nYale SOM offers a two-year joint MBA/Master’s in Asset Management degree. Candidates may apply to both programs simultaneously or apply to the Master's in Asset Management program during the first year of the MBA program. Applicants must be admitted to both programs independently to become a joint degree student. Joint-degree students must complete the first year of the MBA, including the MBA core curriculum, and complete the Asset Management coursework during the second year.\nIncoming students of the Master’s in Asset Management at the Yale School of Management have the opportunity to qualify for an additional two-year STEM extension of their Post-Completion OPT work permission.\nPlease note: Enrollment in a STEM field is only the first qualification in a series of eligibility criteria for the STEM OPT extension. It is ultimately the decision of the Department of Homeland Security to approve these benefits. Review the Department of Homeland Security’s webpage about the STEM extension.\nFor more information contact assetmgmt.admissions@yale.edu.\nMore to discover  »\nMore to discover  »\nIntroduce yourself so that we can provide you with upcoming admissions events, application information, and school news.\n• Master's in Asset Management\n• Admissions\n• Application Information\n• Active U.S. military members and U.S. military veterans\n• Alumni and current students of nearly 700 US colleges and universities that have significant initiatives to promote economic diversity, including institutions where at least 35% of students receive Pell Grants.\n• Alumni of Girls Who Invest\n• Current Forté MBALaunch or MBALaunch for Undergrads participants\n• Current and former U.S. Peace Corps volunteers\n• Current students at Yale University\n• Management Leadership for Tomorrow (MLT) MBA Prep fellows\n• Members and alumni of Teach for America, Teach for China, Teach for India, or other Teach for All Network Partners\n• Members and alumni of First Generation Investors\n• QuestBridge college seniors and alumni\n[GRID_TABLE]\nThe Master’s in Asset Management program is ideal for both recent university graduates and for those who are  early in their careers.

While pre-admission coursework in these areas is encouraged, we admit candidates from a wide range of academic backgrounds and offer a Summer Self-Study program to incoming students who have not had exposure to this subject matter prior to matriculation.\nSummer Self-Study Program\nAdmitted students often ask what they can do to accurately assess and/or strengthen their level of quantitative preparedness prior to starting the program. The Master's in Asset Management program director has crafted a Summer Self-Study program for enrolled students, comprised of a list of online courses specifically designed to help students prepare for the academic rigor of the Asset Management program. Offered at the beginning of the summer prior to the start of the program, this set of online coursework can serve as subject matter review for students who have already taken this coursework, or as a way for students with less previous quantitative coursework to gain critical exposure before starting classes.\nFor reference, the following online coursework was selected for the Master's in Asset Management Class of 2025 Summer Self-Study program:\nDataCamp Python Fundamentals (15 hours)\nDataCamp Statistics Fundamentals with Python (20 hours)\nDataCamp Time Series with Python (20 hours)\nCoursera Linear Algebra (18 hours)\nCoursera Multivariate Calculus (17 hours)\nPlease note that the admissions committee does not expect you to complete these courses prior to submitting your application to the Master’s in Asset Management program.

The only opportunity to receive feedback regarding candidacy for the program is if the Admissions Committee has placed the applicant on the waitlist. The waitlisted applicant may then ask for feedback, allowing them to provide targeted updates to the submitted application.\nThe Admissions Committee considers applications holistically, and reviews each in the context of the overall pool without fixed criteria, formulas, or weight given to specific pieces of the application. You may visit our Class Profile for an overview of the available data for the Class of 2025.

You must send us an official score report for any exam before it expires, as you will not be able to send a report for an expired test score.\nIf you took the exam within the past five years and have designated Yale SOM as a score report recipient, we will have access to all of your GMAT and/or GRE scores from that period.\nWe see and consider all the scores reported to Yale SOM as we review your application, although we credit the highest score you achieved. We do not average scores. If you have taken either exam more than once and have already reported your scores, you will need to report all subsequent scores to our institution code, should you enroll at Yale SOM.\nYou may send your official score reports at any time directly to the Yale School of Management Master’s in Asset Management. Applicants can send official GMAT scores through www.mba.com (search for Yale School of Management and select the “Master of Management Science – Asset Management” option).

Transcripts should clearly show the name of the institution, all course descriptions, and grades. Submit all available pages of each transcript, including pages that detail your institution's grading scale. We will require official transcripts once you enroll at Yale SOM; all offers of admission are conditional until the official transcripts and degree certifications are received and verified.\nIf your transcript is not in English, we request both a copy of the original untranslated transcript as well as a notarized English translation.\nIf your degree-granting university transcript includes any study abroad work or transfer credits, you’ll need to submit a separate transcript from the institution where those courses were completed.  The only exception is if your degree-granting university includes the full course names and grades (not pass/fail) for your study abroad or transfer credits; in this case, you do not need to submit a separate transcript from the institution where those courses were completed.\nIf you are currently a student, your transcript must reflect grades and GPA (if applicable) through the end of the most recently completed semester (typically Fall 2024). If these grades are not available at the time of your application, you must submit an updated transcript through the form on your Application Status Page as soon as your grades become available.\nOnly report a GPA if it is listed on your transcript; do not calculate your own GPA if it does not appear on your transcript.  In this case, leave the GPA field blank and check the box reading “No GPA reported on transcript.”\nOne of the recommenders must be in a position to assess your performance in a university setting, such as a professor or academic mentor. The second recommendation must be from a professional or extracurricular supervisor or another individual who has worked with you in an applied setting (such as an internship, full-time work experience, research, or long-term academic project). We highly recommend securing a recommendation from what you consider to be your most significant professional or applied experience.\nIf any aspect of your application requires additional explanation, you can address it in the Optional Information section. This might include academic performance, promotions or recognitions, or other information that is not apparent from the rest of your application. The Optional Information section is truly optional - if no aspect of your application requires further explanation, you should leave this section blank.\nThe Behavioral Assessment is a non-cognitive instrument that measures a set of inter- and intrapersonal competencies that are associated with success in a business school program. It will never be the deciding factor for admission but will instead be viewed in combination with the rest of your profile.\n\nThe assessment is a series of questions that will take roughly 25 minutes to complete. It does not require any knowledge or advanced preparation, you’ll simply be presented with pairs of statements and asked to select the ones that best match your own behaviors.\nInterviews are offered by invitation on a rolling basis throughout the admissions cycle and are 30 minutes in length. You will be contacted via email if invited to interview.\nJoint-degree applicants must apply to and be admitted to both programs independently. Applicants may apply to both programs simultaneously, or apply to the Master’s in Asset Management program during their first year of the Yale SOM MBA program.\nIn the MBA/Master's in Asset Management joint-degree program, students must complete the first year of the MBA program, including the MBA core curriculum, and then complete the asset management coursework during the second year. Both degrees will be awarded at the end of the two-year period.\nReapplicants are required to submit a new application, upload new essays (including a reapplicant essay), pay the application fee, and complete the video questions. If you have applied within the last two years, you are not required to submit new transcripts or a new test score report.\nYour circumstances may have changed in the year since you last applied, and you may decide to request new letters of recommendation. However, if you wish to use one or both letters from your previous application, please email us and let us know which letter you would like us to reattach in support of your new application file.\nIf you are reapplying, the Admissions Committee will look to understand what has changed about your candidacy since your last application. Therefore, we suggest you reapply only when you have had enough time to reflect on your candidacy and can provide meaningful updates.\nOnce you submit your application online, you will be able to check your online status by signing in with your email address and password. You will then be able to see which materials our office has received and which we are still awaiting.\nApplications for the Master's in Asset Management Class of 2026 are now under review, and decisions will be released on March 27, 2025.\nAfter submitting your application, any material changes or updates – such as new grades or a change in employment – must be reported as soon as possible through the form on your application status page. You may also use this form to report other updates, such as a new test score. We will do our best, but we cannot guarantee that new materials received after the application deadline will be considered in our evaluation process.\nAll applicants are automatically considered for a merit scholarship.

Education in English-medium institutions in other countries or territories does not qualify for the exemption.\nTest scores are valid for two years. For applicants applying in January 2025, we will accept a TOEFL, DET, or IELTS test taken within two years of the date of your application submission.\nWhen assessing English language abilities, we will also consider any other experiences you’ve had in English, such as internships and study abroad, in addition to the TOEFL, DET, or IELTS test scores.\nYale's Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS) provides English language support, local community connections, and a multitude of events for international students and their families.

Keep in mind, however, that these statistics are averages and ranges, and may not represent the full, diverse spectrum of who we admit.\nThe three most important components of an application are academic preparation, professional impact and potential and your desire to make a difference in the field of asset management. We highly value quantitative skills in economics, applied math, and STEM; however, our student body comes from a diverse range of backgrounds.\nA strong quantitative background will serve as a helpful foundation to prepare for the Master’s in Asset Management program. Courses in multivariable calculus, linear or matrix algebra, microeconomic theory, probability and statistics, and computer programming are not required for admission, but exposure to the subject matter through academic or supplemental study will provide a highly beneficial background for the curriculum. Applicants are asked to note any previous coursework in these topics in the application so the admissions committee can identify if you may benefit from additional quantitative exposure prior to matriculating at Yale SOM, including our Summer Self-Study program.\nYes, the Master’s in Asset Management was designed for early career professionals in the asset management industry. Whether you are currently finishing your undergraduate degree or you have work experience in a different field and are looking to pivot into the financial services industry, you may be an excellent candidate for admission.\nIf you’re currently an undergraduate student, you can strengthen your academic courseload with classes such as multivariable calculus, linear algebra, microeconomic theory, and probability and statistics, just to name a few. You should also consider some coursework or applied experience in computer programming. In general, students planning on entering the asset management industry should have a strong quantitative background. We encourage you to make room in your schedule – whether through coursework at your undergraduate institution or through an online certificate program – to build a good quantitative foundation, as it will serve you well when trying to secure a job in the asset management industry. Additionally, we encourage you to take a look at your campus offerings, like finance or investing clubs, student run funds, and internship opportunities to gain practical experience in the field.\nThe Master’s in Asset Management is a 9-month, quantitatively intensive program. Students may not extend or shorten this degree.\nNo, the Master’s in Asset Management is a full-time, on-campus master’s degree program.\nOur graduates are performing a range of functions upon graduating from the Master's in Asset Management program , from buy-side analyst to investment manager just to name a few, and have settled in geographic regions as nearby as Greenwich, Connecticut to as far away as Shanghai, China. We invite you to explore the Careers/Employment page of our website, as well as our Class of 2023 Employment Report.\nWe do not offer pre-application reviews and are unable to provide feedback on your chances for admission. The only opportunity to receive feedback regarding candidacy for the program is if the Admissions Committee has placed the applicant on the waitlist. The waitlisted applicant may then ask for feedback, allowing them to provide targeted updates to the submitted application.\nThe Admissions Committee considers applications holistically, and reviews each in the context of the overall pool without fixed criteria, formulas, or weight given to specific pieces of the application.
