      "content": "[HEADING] Carey students shine at INFORMS and CFA competitions\n[HEADING] Upcoming Carey application deadlines\nCarey students showed their analytical and financial expertise at two recent events, earning top honors and strengthening Carey’s international reputation.\nAt Johns Hopkins Carey Business School, our students put their classroom knowledge into action by participating in real-world experiences. This spring, Carey students demonstrated their skills on the national and global stages, presenting their business solutions at the INFORMS Analytics+ Conference and taking first place at the CFA Financial Career Accelerator in China.\nINFORMS Analytics+ ConferenceThe INFORMS Analytics+ Conference is a practitioner-focused event that brings together more than 700 academics and industry professionals to explore the latest advances in analytics and AI for solving real-world business challenges. One of the major highlights of the conference is the competitive student poster session, which accepts only a select number of high-quality submissions each year.\nAll eight students from Carey’s Business Analytics program had their posters submitted and selected. The students, mentored by Academic Program Director and Professor Naser Nikandish and Associate Professor Mohammad Yazdi, each chose a project focusing on high-impact solutions through analytical rigor and practical relevance. The eight students who presented their posters are: Joanne Qingqing Jiang, Louise Ju-Yin Lee, Jia Liang, Yijun Shen, Andrea Jianing Yan, Ziyao Friedrich Wang, Wenze Zhao, and Xuanye Zhu.\n“The INFORMS Analytics+ Conference was a tremendous success for our students and for the Carey community overall,” said Nikandish. “Witnessing our students present their posters with professionalism, confidence, and genuine passion was incredibly rewarding.”\nBeyond the poster sessions, students actively networked with industry professionals, faculty, and their peers. And prior to the event, the students met with the Career & Life Design team to sharpen their networking skills and conduct practice presentation sessions to perfect their delivery.\nINFORMS also hosts the Early Career Professional Network, a professional development and networking workshop for business analytics students. Each school can nominate up to two students. Students are selected based on their resumés and application materials. This year, both Carey students nominated were selected. This marks the first time Carey students have been selected for ECPN, a milestone that reflects the growing reputation of the Business Analytics program and its students.\nLee, who was selected to participate in the ECPN, presented her poster, “Investing in Communities for a Stronger Tomorrow: Data-Driven Health Solutions,” in collaboration with Community Hospitality Healthcare Services. Her project used descriptive and prescriptive analytics to strategically allocate federal tax credits to medically underserved areas.\nJiang presented her poster “Optimized Credit Risk Prediction Using Advanced Modeling,” focusing on how machine learning models can identify and improve credit default prediction. By analyzing payment behaviors and customer profiles, Jiang identified key predictors like delay patterns, fluctuations in bill payments, and repayment score.\n“Preparing this poster allowed me to apply a wide range of skills I’ve learned throughout the program. From data analysis and machine learning to Python programming and data visualization, the technical knowledge I gained across multiple courses came together to support this project. Equally important were the business communication skills I developed, which helped me explain complex results in a clear, structured, and accessible way,” said Jiang.\nBy participating in this conference, our students not only gained valuable insights and industry connections, but they also reinforced Carey’s commitment to relentless advancement and unwavering humanity.\n2025 CFA Financial Career Accelerator A team of four Carey Finance students and one student from the National University of Singapore won first place at the 2025 CFA Financial Career Accelerator in Beijing, China. Out of more than 300 teams in the initial rounds, 22 teams were selected as finalists to present in China. This is the second year a Carey team has participated in this global competition.\nLed by Faculty Advisors Senior Lecturer Xiaohua Hu and Professor Xian Sun, the Carey team named Cross Pacific consisted of: Corinne Jiayi Li, Wenliang Lin, Hanbin Luo, Xinyan Rong, and Jinmu Song. The team impressed a panel of industry and government experts with their research, clear delivery, and sharp responses.\nThe team presented the topic, “Personalized Investment Solution for the Chinese Retired Demographic,” and introduced a solution of the three-layer framework, which combines global best practices with China’s specific market conditions. The first layer adjusted the target-date pension fund concept to suit local market volatility by gradually reducing equity exposure. The second layer applied efficient frontier optimization adjusted to China’s regulatory constraints, creating a stable and conservative portfolio mainly focused on bonds and cash. And the third layer used the analytic hierarchy process to rank five retirement goals, offering truly personalized investment suggestions.\n“The finance program played a key role in preparing us for this competition, especially through the courses that combine technical tools with real-world applications,” said Song. “The courses trained us to handle financial data, build models, and interpret results independently. We were able to quickly learn and apply LSTM and ARIMA techniques–despite never having worked with them before–and successfully integrate them into our project under a tight timeline.”\nThe competition also included a Best Personal Contribution Award, which was awarded to Li, recognizing her performance and insight during the competition.\nCarey’s continued involvement with the CFA Challenges underscores the growing international opportunities available to Carey students.\nThe 2026 application for the Full-time MBA is now open. The 2026 application for all other programs will open later this summer.\n• LinkedIn\n• Facebook\n• X\n• Share via Email\n[GRID_TABLE]\nMay 05, 2025\n\n        Carey students shine at INFORMS and CFA competitions\n    \n\nCarey students showed their analytical and financial expertise at two recent events, earning top honors and strengthening Carey’s international reputation.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\nShare via Email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Student experience\n            \n\n\n\n              Business Analytics\n            \n\n\n\n              Finance\n            \n\n\n\n\nAt Johns Hopkins Carey Business School, our students put their classroom knowledge into action by participating in real-world experiences.

We were able to quickly learn and apply LSTM and ARIMA techniques–despite never having worked with them before–and successfully integrate them into our project under a tight timeline.”The competition also included a Best Personal Contribution Award, which was awarded to Li, recognizing her performance and insight during the competition.Carey’s continued involvement with the CFA Challenges underscores the growing international opportunities available to Carey students. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            people sitting in chairs in an audience. main point in photo is person smiling and clapping hands over head\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            seven people standing on stage posing for photo holding a certificate in hands\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            five people posing for photo with a photographer\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            group of people standing, posing and smiling for a photo\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            person standing at podium speaking to a large group of people sitting at tables\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            person standing and pointing to a poster board, presenting to people\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            two people smiling for photo standing next to a large poster board presentation\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            people standing next to a poster board speaking together in a circle\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            two people, one person is pointing to a poster board and then other is listening\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            people standing next to a poster board, one is presenting to the others\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            people standing next to a poster board speaking\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            one person presenting a poster board to another person\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            one person pointing to a poster and presenting to three other people\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpcoming Carey application deadlines\nThe 2026 application for the Full-time MBA is now open.

The 12-month program includes in-person fall, spring, and summer coursework. Classes are completed in late July and the conferral date (date on your diploma) is in August. For students starting in the 12-month program in Fall 2024, the conferral date will be August 22, 2025. The 15-month program includes fall, spring, no summer coursework, and then additional fall coursework. Classes are completed and conferral date is in December. For students starting in the 15-month program in Fall 2024, the conferral date will be December 31, 2025. Tentative sample program plans with course sequence and credit load per term are shown below:\nFall 1 - 2024\nFall 2 - 2024\nSpring 1 - 2025\nSpring 2 - 2025\nSummer - 2025\n210.620 Accounting and Financial Reporting\n232.701 Investments\n120.601 Business Communication\n230.620 Financial Modeling and Valuation\n131.601 Business Leadership and Human Values\n231.620 Corporate Finance\n232.610 Computational Finance\n232.710 Derivatives\n232.640 Empirical Finance\n510.601 Statistical Analysis\n232.620 Linear Econometrics for Finance\n232.630 Non-Linear Econometrics for Finance\n232.720 Fixed Income\nFall 1 - 2024\nFall 2 - 2024\nSpring 1 - 2025\nSpring 2 - 2025\nSummer - 2025\nFall I - 2025\nFall II - 2025\n232.701 Investments\n120.601 Business Communication\n231.620 Corporate Finance\n232.610 Computational Finance\n232.640 Empirical Finance\n510.601 Statistical Analysis\n232.710 Derivatives\n232.720 Fixed Income\n*This is a sample program plan that is subject to change.\nYes, both programs are 36-credits include the Financial Econometrics area of concentration which is STEM designated.\nYes, the 12 and 15-month programs have the same curriculum that includes the CFA Institute’s Candidate Body of Knowledge, preparing you to sit for the CFA exams.\nThe 12-month and 15-month versions of the program are each taught at both of our locations. You must submit an application to one version of the program at one location. You may not apply to multiple versions of multiple locations at the same time.\nThe 15-month program is ideal for those who plan to use the summer to gain practical experience rather than taking Carey courses. This may include participating in consulting projects with community businesses, joining travel-based leadership courses, or applying to internship programs or full-time employment. International students should contact the Office of International Services to check full or part-time work eligibility based on visa status.\nThis track is also ideal for students looking for a lighter courseload per term. A lighter courseload increases capacity to attend co-curricular programming, participate in faculty research, and/or engage in the local community.\nThe 12-month program is ideal for those looking to gain a masters degree in one year to enter the job force right away. This program is also ideal for those looking to pursue a second degree at Carey, obtaining two masters degrees in two years\nNo, there are no practicum or internship electives in the 12 or 15-month curriculum.\nNote: 15-month program International students who apply and are approved for CPT will be enrolled in a zero credit course titled BU.001.600 Graduate Internship Project. For more information on CPT, please visit: https://ois.jhu.edu/Students/Current_F1_Students/F-1_Training_and_Employment/Curricular_Practical_Training/index.html.\nStudents accepted to the 12-month program can request a deferral to the following year, but they can only defer to the 12-month version of the program. If interested in the 15-month program the following year, students must reapply.\nStudents accepted to the 15-month program can request a deferral to the following year, but they can only defer to the 15-month version of the program. If interested in the 12-month program the following year, students must reapply.\nYes, students in both programs may be in some of the same sections of classes in fall and spring.\nFull-time Master of Science students are required to attend classes in-person in fall, spring, and summer terms. Students who receive a full-time job offer related to their studies beginning in June or July (their final summer term) can provide that job offer to the Programs leadership team to request the ability to take summer classes remotely (synchronous online, meaning on a certain day of the week and at a certain time via Zoom) in order to be able to accept that job offer. Requests will be denied for part-time or internship work. Requests are approved rarely, and only when there is space and capacity to do so. Students with a job offer are not guaranteed virtual classes in the summer term, and we highly recommend all students plan to be in-person for their summer courses. In the past, students have struggled to balance the rigorous full-time coursework with full-time employment. Only students in good academic standing will have requests reviewed. International students should contact the JHU Office of International Services at OIS@jhu.edu to determine eligibility to work in the United States based on their visa.\nThe 15-month program is solely in-person. There is no option to be online.\nAs this is the first year we are piloting the 15-month course sequence, we don’t know how many applications we will receive. There are fewer seats in the 15-month program as we are piloting the new course sequence, but the curriculum is the same. Students cannot apply for more than one version of the program at a time.\nYour diploma will show program name as MS in Finance, whether you take the 12 or 15-month program. The only difference for the 15-month program is that your transcript will show courses taken across two academic years and the program name on transcript will indicate the 15-month program.\nYes, class sizes are the same. Class sizes at Carey vary from 28-60.\nThe 12-month program students graduate in August (Conferral date in late August). For students starting in the 12-month program in Fall 2024, the conferral date will be August 22, 2025. The 15-month program students graduate in December (Conferral date in late December). For students starting in the 15-month program in Fall 2024, the conferral date will be December 31, 2025. There is one graduation ceremony in May each year. Students who graduate in the 12 and 15-month program can participate in the May ceremony prior to or after program completion.\nThe tuition for the 15-month program plan in the full-time Master of Science in Finance will be 3-5% more than the tuition for the 12-month program plan. Tuition costs noted are projections. Tuition rates for 2024-2025 will be approved by the Johns Hopkins University Board of Trustees and published in Spring 2024.\nThe tuition differential for the 15-month program plan supports the additional co-curricular events and student resources, such as career coaching and academic advising, that will benefit students during their extended time on campus.\nWe are dedicated to serving our students, colleagues, and the greater Carey community in a compliant and equitable manner. There are no differences in financial aid eligibility for the 12 and 15-month program. Carey offers numerous options for financing your education, including scholarship aid, loans, payment plans, and tuition reimbursement available to those who qualify.\nStudents in the 12-month program should plan to be in the Baltimore or Washington D.C. area from mid-August to early August of the next year. Students in the 15-month program should plan to be in the Baltimore or Washington D.C. area from mid-August to end of December of the following year, but students are not required to be in the area during the summer term. All important dates can be found on the academic calendar.\nUniversity-wide housing resources\nStudents will be billed for health care for each semester in which they are enrolled. Summer terms are not billed separately and are included in the spring semester.\nYes, students who graduate in August can apply to immediately start a second degree. Students who graduate in December can also apply to start a second degree in January, but not all academic programs have a January start date.\nCarey has a variety of student organizations available to engage with and hone your leadership skills. Students in the 15-month program would be able to serve in organization leadership positions longer.\nCase Competitions are hosted nationally and internationally year-round. MBA competitions\nStudents in the 15-month program can apply to participate in summer travel-based courses like Global Immersion or Leadership Development Expeditions as well.\nThe Career & Life Design team tailors our support to the needs of each Carey Business School student.

You must submit an application to one version of the program at one location. You may not apply to multiple versions of multiple locations at the same time.\n[DEFINITION_LIST]\nWho should apply for the 15-month program?: The 15-month program is ideal for those who plan to use the summer to gain practical experience rather than taking Carey courses. This may include participating in consulting projects with community businesses, joining travel-based leadership courses, or applying to internship programs or full-time employment. International students should contact the Office of International Services to check full or part-time work eligibility based on visa status.\nThis track is also ideal for students looking for a lighter courseload per term. A lighter courseload increases capacity to attend co-curricular programming, participate in faculty research, and/or engage in the local community.\n[DEFINITION_LIST]\nWho should apply for the 12-month program?: The 12-month program is ideal for those looking to gain a masters degree in one year to enter the job force right away. This program is also ideal for those looking to pursue a second degree at Carey, obtaining two masters degrees in two years\n[DEFINITION_LIST]\nCan I take an internship for credit?: No, there are no practicum or internship electives in the 12 or 15-month curriculum.\nNote: 15-month program International students who apply and are approved for CPT will be enrolled in a zero credit course titled BU.001.600 Graduate Internship Project. For more information on CPT, please visit: https://ois.jhu.edu/Students/Current_F1_Students/F-1_Training_and_Employment/Curricular_Practical_Training/index.html.\n[DEFINITION_LIST]\nWho can defer, and to which program?: Students accepted to the 12-month program can request a deferral to the following year, but they can only defer to the 12-month version of the program. If interested in the 15-month program the following year, students must reapply.\nStudents accepted to the 15-month program can request a deferral to the following year, but they can only defer to the 15-month version of the program. If interested in the 12-month program the following year, students must reapply.\n[DEFINITION_LIST]\nDo 12 and 15-month program students take classes together?: Yes, students in both programs may be in some of the same sections of classes in fall and spring.\n[DEFINITION_LIST]\nIf I take the 12-month program, can I take classes remotely in the summer term?: Full-time Master of Science students are required to attend classes in-person in fall, spring, and summer terms. Students who receive a full-time job offer related to their studies beginning in June or July (their final summer term) can provide that job offer to the Programs leadership team to request the ability to take summer classes remotely (synchronous online, meaning on a certain day of the week and at a certain time via Zoom) in order to be able to accept that job offer. Requests will be denied for part-time or internship work. Requests are approved rarely, and only when there is space and capacity to do so. Students with a job offer are not guaranteed virtual classes in the summer term, and we highly recommend all students plan to be in-person for their summer courses. In the past, students have struggled to balance the rigorous full-time coursework with full-time employment. Only students in good academic standing will have requests reviewed. International students should contact the JHU Office of International Services at OIS@jhu.edu to determine eligibility to work in the United States based on their visa.\n[DEFINITION_LIST]\nCan I take classes online in the 15-month program?: The 15-month program is solely in-person. There is no option to be online.\n[DEFINITION_LIST]\nAre the admissions standards different for both programs (i.e. is one more difficult to gain admission into/more competitive than the other)?: As this is the first year we are piloting the 15-month course sequence, we don’t know how many applications we will receive. There are fewer seats in the 15-month program as we are piloting the new course sequence, but the curriculum is the same. Students cannot apply for more than one version of the program at a time.\n[DEFINITION_LIST]\nWill my degree/diploma specifically show that I completed a 15-month MSF program, or will it show the same as the 12-month?: Your diploma will show program name as MS in Finance, whether you take the 12 or 15-month program. The only difference for the 15-month program is that your transcript will show courses taken across two academic years and the program name on transcript will indicate the 15-month program.\n[DEFINITION_LIST]\nWill the class sizes be the same for the 12 and 15-month programs?: Yes, class sizes are the same. Class sizes at Carey vary from 28-60.\n[DEFINITION_LIST]\nWhen will we graduate?: The 12-month program students graduate in August (Conferral date in late August). For students starting in the 12-month program in Fall 2024, the conferral date will be August 22, 2025. The 15-month program students graduate in December (Conferral date in late December). For students starting in the 15-month program in Fall 2024, the conferral date will be December 31, 2025. There is one graduation ceremony in May each year. Students who graduate in the 12 and 15-month program can participate in the May ceremony prior to or after program completion.\n[DEFINITION_LIST]\nIs the tuition the same for 12 and 15-month FT MSF academic programs?: The tuition for the 15-month program plan in the full-time Master of Science in Finance will be 3-5% more than the tuition for the 12-month program plan. Tuition costs noted are projections. Tuition rates for 2024-2025 will be approved by the Johns Hopkins University Board of Trustees and published in Spring 2024.\nThe tuition differential for the 15-month program plan supports the additional co-curricular events and student resources, such as career coaching and academic advising, that will benefit students during their extended time on campus.\n[DEFINITION_LIST]\nAre scholarships available?: We are dedicated to serving our students, colleagues, and the greater Carey community in a compliant and equitable manner. There are no differences in financial aid eligibility for the 12 and 15-month program. Carey offers numerous options for financing your education, including scholarship aid, loans, payment plans, and tuition reimbursement available to those who qualify.\n[DEFINITION_LIST]\nHow is my housing affected by the summer break?  Will I be able to extend my lease for a partial year?: Students in the 12-month program should plan to be in the Baltimore or Washington D.C. area from mid-August to early August of the next year. Students in the 15-month program should plan to be in the Baltimore or Washington D.C. area from mid-August to end of December of the following year, but students are not required to be in the area during the summer term. All important dates can be found on the academic calendar.\nUniversity-wide housing resources\n[DEFINITION_LIST]\nHow is my health care plan affected?  Will I have coverage during the break?: Students will be billed for health care for each semester in which they are enrolled. Summer terms are not billed separately and are included in the spring semester.\n\nFall 2024: August 15, 2024- December 31, 2024\nSpring 2025: January 1, 2025 – August 14, 2025\nFall 2025: August 15, 2025 – December 31, 2025\n[DEFINITION_LIST]\nCan students in both programs pursue a second FT MS degree?: Yes, students who graduate in August can apply to immediately start a second degree. Students who graduate in December can also apply to start a second degree in January, but not all academic programs have a January start date.\n[DEFINITION_LIST]\nWill there be access to faculty during summer?: Carey has a variety of student organizations available to engage with and hone your leadership skills. Students in the 15-month program would be able to serve in organization leadership positions longer.\nCase Competitions are hosted nationally and internationally year-round. MBA competitions\nStudents in the 15-month program can apply to participate in summer travel-based courses like Global Immersion or Leadership Development Expeditions as well.\n[DEFINITION_LIST]\nWill Carey help me find a summer internship in the US?: The Career & Life Design team tailors our support to the needs of each Carey Business School student. In collaboration with Carey Employer Relations, Alumni Relations, Experiential Learning, Student Affairs, and JHU's Integrative Learning and Life Design, we help connect students to internships, jobs, alumni and industry partners, and industry networking and career growth opportunities. We will collaborate with any student who is interested in landing a summer internship, but there is no guarantee.

As such, we will work with you individually to ensure your application is complete. Please reach out to an admissions officer for assistance.\nFall 2025 Application Deadlines\nApplicants must submit a total of two required essays. The first essay topic is required for all applicants and must be responded to directly. You will choose your second essay topic from the list provided on the application.

Test-optional means it is your choice as an applicant to determine whether or not to submit a GMAT or GRE score with your application. If you have taken a test and believe a score will add value to your application, you should submit one. If you do not wish to test or believe your test score does not reflect your ability and potential for graduate study, please do not include a score. You will indicate whether you wish to submit a test score on the application.\nIf you decide to submit a score, you can self-report your score on the application, but you should also have your official score sent directly to Johns Hopkins Carey Business School. We accept scores from both the GMAT and the GRE that are up to five years old and do not have a preference for either test.

Space in Washington, DC is limited and often fills following round two.\nEach school at Johns Hopkins University has an independent Office of Admissions and its own application process.
