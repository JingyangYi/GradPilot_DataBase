Your qualification will be used as evidence of your English proficiency.\nIf you do need to provide evidence of your English proficiency, this will be indicated in your application. You can prove this by providing evidence that you meet one or more of the following criteria:\n\nEnglish language tests and university English courses\nPrior study in the medium of English\nOther qualifications\n\nIf you need to improve your English skills before you start your degree, UNSW College’s Academic English Programs are for you. The programs are suitable for various English levels and help you prepare for university studies and life in Australia.\nFor more details, visit the English Language Requirements page. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Master of Finance has two entry points, which require varying qualifications.

programs, including:\nThere are three grouped rounds per intake, with the number of offers in each round reflecting program capacity. Applications submitted before the application deadline for a specific grouped offer round will be ranked based on academic merit and offers will be made to the top-ranked applicants.

As a result, we expect that there may be longer visa processing times for students submitting visa applications to study at UNSW Sydney.\nTo avoid delays on your study plan, we encourage you to submit your visa application to the Australian Government as soon as you receive a Confirmation of Enrolment (COE) from us.\nFor more information about applying for an Australian Student Visa, please visit this page.\nUNSW will be making offers to eligible postgraduate programs on the basis of six out of eight or seven out of eight semesters studied. Students will need a weighted average mark (WAM) of 5 points above the advertised level to be eligible with 6/8 semesters studied, or a weighted average mark (WAM) of 2 points above the advertised level to be eligible with 7/8 or 5/6 semesters studied.\nApplicants who do not meet this rank will be placed on hold and may be made an offer once they upload their final results.\nWe have altered our policy around predicted grades to widen the qualifications that we accept and have improved the process of assessment. UNSW now accepts predicted grades for full offers for the following qualifications:\nStudents who are completing an approved external English language program can request an extension of their offer deadline until their course is finished.\nForecast results must be presented in the following format:\nStudents who meet program entry requirements based on their SAT, AP, or ACT results are now eligible to receive a full or conditional on English offer ahead of their final high school result and proof of and completion of high school studies. Results and proof of high school completion will be required no later than the UNSW term commencement date and must be submitted as soon as they become available. This change aims to support students in lodging timely visa applications and re-establishes opportunity to commence their undergraduate studies as planned.\nIn addition to sharing SAT/AP/ACT results with UNSW via the College Board portal, students must submit a letter from their school meeting the following minimum criteria:\nThis assessment policy is only available for students completing Year 12 high school qualifications recognised by UNSW for direct entry. It excludes:\nIf an application is incomplete by the final submission date for that term, it will not meet the requirements and will not be eligible for an offer, resulting in a denial.\nTo be eligible for consideration in a grouped offer round, applicants must meet the minimum entry requirements for the program as listed on the degree page for the program noting that these requirements are a guide only and do not guarantee an offer will be made.\nUpon assessment within each offer round, applicants will fall into one of three categories:\nUNSW is unable to provide estimated grouped offer round admissions cut-offs as these will be based on the quality of applicants within each offer round. Once the initial three rounds of grouped offers are complete for a program, we will publish indicative scores (including average and lowest scores for receiving an offer) on the relevant program’s degree page on the UNSW website.\nThe number of offers made during each round will be determined by program capacity. UNSW is unable to share this information with applicants.\nUNSW reserves the right to make ad-hoc offers to exceptional applicants outside of the grouped offer rounds. We will also continue to make offers via UAC for relevant students, with entry ranks reflecting grouped offer round cut-offs.\nIf you need to complete a 10-week or 15-week University English Entry Course (UEEC) offered by UNSW College and are looking to study one of the high-demand programs in 2026, please submit your complete application by the grouped round 1 application deadline of each term for your best opportunity to commence your study in that term.\nIf you require an English package and would like to defer, you will need to request a deferred offer from UNSW. Once you have the deferred offer, it should be provided to UNSW College Admissions, who can issue an updated offer for your English course. Please note, deferral requests are not guaranteed to be approved.\nUNSW expects to make a number of offers through UAC for International Students. The majority of these offers will be made in the UAC December Round 2 offer round for 2026 intake.\nUNSW will release conditional offers based on English language results during regular offer rounds. These offers will include an expiry deadline by which students must meet the conditions - either by submitting their English test results or enrolling in UNSW College’s UEEC program.\nStudents who are completing an approved external English language program can request an extension of their offer expiry deadline until their course is finished.\nStudents seeking to defer their offer to study at UNSW (before accepting) may submit an offer deferral request via the following channels:\nPlease note that offer deferral is not guaranteed and requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Where permitted, offers will only be able to be deferred for a period of up to one year.\nYou can find more about deferment and deferral here.\nMost UNSW international offer holders will have a personalised offer expiry date to accept, decline or defer their study at UNSW. The offer expiry will be active from the date that you receive your offer and your offer will lapse after the offer expiry date.\nOffer holders will have until 11:59 pm (AEDT) to accept their offer on the acceptance deadline date.\nThe following cohorts will not have an offer expiry:\nUAC International Offer Holders will also receive a personalised offer expiry and must accept within this period.\nConditional offer holders will have an offer expiry date that conditions must be met by in order to be issued a full, unconditional offer. Please note these full offers will also have an additional offer expiry date.\nFull offer holders\nFull offer holders will now have 21 days to accept their offer before it expires.\nConditional offer holders\nConditional offer holders will have 8 weeks (56 days) to meet the conditions of their offer, either by submitting English language results or confirming their enrolment in UNSW College’s UEEC program and accept their offer. Students who are completing an approved external English language program can request an extension of their offer expiry deadline until their course is finished.\nOnce the conditions are met and offer is accepted, students will receive a full offer, which will include our standard 21-day period to accept the offer.\nYou can see your offer expiry date on your offer letter and on UNSW Accept Online.\nYou will need to reapply to study at UNSW.\nUNSW will only approve for an extension on an offer under special circumstances. This also applies for UAC International students who have missed the deadline.\nThe below reasons are not accepted as reasons for extension of an offer:\nIf you have an extenuating circumstance, please contact your agent or UNSW regional representative.\nUNSW will only approve for an extension on an offer under extreme special circumstances. This also applies for UAC International students who have missed the deadline.\nYou will not receive another offer letter, however you can see the revised expiry date on UNSW Accept Online.\nMost UNSW offer holders will have a set time period to accept, decline or defer their study at UNSW. The personalised offer expiry is specified in the offer letter and UNSW Accept Online.\nIf you are in one of the following cohorts, you will not have a personalised offer expiry:\nUNSW will move to a new academic calendar in 2028.\nAs a global top 20 university and ranked number one in Australia for employment outcomes (2025 QS World University Rankings), this new academic calendar is designed to meet the changing needs of the broader educational landscape and follows extensive feedback from students, staff and the community over the past 18 months.\nThe new ‘flex-semester’ calendar is a semester structure for our undergraduate students and the majority of postgraduate students, centring on delivering the best learning experiences and outcomes for all our students throughout their lifelong education journey.\nFor further information on the new calendar and FAQs please visit our website.\nIf you can’t find the answer you’re looking for below, our Future Student Advisers are here to help.\nSign up to our newsletter - we'll keep you updated on degree information, scholarships and upcoming events.\n• Search\n• LinkedIn\n• Facebook\n• Instagram\n• TikTok\n• YouTube\n• Applications are prioritised according to academic merit and subject to program availability.\n• Issued offers will have a specified acceptance period.\n• Offer deferrals will no longer be automatically approved.\n• Change of program requests will only be considered with a new application.\n• Grouped offer rounds are used for high-demand programs.

All applications submitted within the application period for that grouped offer round will be ranked by academic merit and offers made to the top-ranked applicants. For 2026 intakes, the grouped offer rounds apply to the following programs:\nBachelor of Commerce and associated programs\nBachelor of Exercise Science/Master of Physiotherapy and Exercise Physiology\nMaster of Information Technology and associated programs\nMaster of Laws.\n\n\n\nRefer to the FAQs below for more information.\nInformation on this page is correct as of the day of publication. UNSW reserves the right to change offer rounds and admissions processes as required without prior notice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2025 Applications\nUNSW Sydney is nearing its 2025 capacity for total international student enrolments. We are assessing all existing applications for 2026 study start dates, with a few exceptions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat this means for 2025 applicants \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplications to 2025 intakes are now closed.  \nUNSW will be making very limited additional offers for the Term 3 2025 intake.   \nCurrent UNSW undergraduate students applying for UNSW postgraduate study and sponsored students will be prioritised for remaining Term 3 2025 places. These offers will continue to be released on a rolling basis.  \nExisting conditional offers (English and GTE) remain valid, and we encourage these offer holders to meet the conditions of their offer as soon as possible.    \nExisting UNSW College students with a packaged offer to study in Term 3 2025 at UNSW remain unaffected.   \nAny 2025 applicants who fall outside the prioritised categories will now be assessed for the next available 2026 intake. Offers for eligible students will be released from Thursday, 26 June.  \nDeferments are only available for 2026 intakes \nLate acceptance extension requests will no longer be approved and we encourage students to accept their offer on time.  \nStudy abroad and non-award students are not impacted and processes and deadlines remain the same.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2026 Applications\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplications for general programs\nApplications for 2026 are open.

As a result, we expect that there may be longer visa processing times for students submitting visa applications to study at UNSW Sydney.  \nTo avoid delays on your study plan, we encourage you to submit your visa application to the Australian Government as soon as you receive a Confirmation of Enrolment (COE) from us.\nFor more information about applying for an Australian Student Visa, please visit this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAQs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Apply to UNSW\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Can I apply to UNSW with incomplete academic results? \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUNSW will be making offers to eligible postgraduate programs on the basis of six out of eight or seven out of eight semesters studied. Students will need a weighted average mark (WAM) of 5 points above the advertised level to be eligible with 6/8 semesters studied, or a weighted average mark (WAM) of 2 points above the advertised level to be eligible with 7/8 or 5/6 semesters studied.\nApplicants who do not meet this rank will be placed on hold and may be made an offer once they upload their final results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Will UNSW accept predicted grades for full undergraduate offers?\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have altered our policy around predicted grades to widen the qualifications that we accept and have improved the process of assessment. UNSW now accepts predicted grades for full offers for the following qualifications:\n\nInternational Baccalaureate (IB)\nA-Levels\nIndian CBSE\nSingapore A-levels\nNCUK\nSouth African NSC\n\nStudents who are completing an approved external English language program can request an extension of their offer deadline until their course is finished.\nKey considerations:\n\nA buffer of 2 points above the standard entry requirement is required for a full offer based on predicted grades. Offers will only be issued where this is met or exceeded and all other requirements have been met.\nStudents must provide final results when available, and no later than the UNSW term commencement date.\nIf final results do not meet program entry requirements, students may need to:\ntransfer to a program with lower requirements, or\nexplore pathway options such as UNSW College Diplomas, or\nseek study alternatives outside UNSW\n\n\n\nRequired documentation:\nForecast results must be presented in the following format:\n\nBe printed on official school letterhead and include the institution stamp and signature of the Principal, Registrar or Academic Director.\nBe dated after 1 May for Term 1 (February intake) and 1 November of the previous year for Term 3 (September intake).\nFor IB Forecast only: IB Forecast results have the total predicted score as well as the individual scores for each subject.\nThe total predicted aggregate must be the equivalent of 2 points higher than the total final aggregate required for admission.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                What are the eligibility criteria and additional requirements for UNSW applicants holding SAT, AP, or ACT results?\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents who meet program entry requirements based on their SAT, AP, or ACT results are now eligible to receive a full or conditional on English offer ahead of their final high school result and proof of and completion of high school studies. Results and proof of high school completion will be required no later than the UNSW term commencement date and must be submitted as soon as they become available. This change aims to support students in lodging timely visa applications and re-establishes opportunity to commence their undergraduate studies as planned.\nAdditional requirement – enrolment or expected graduation letter\nIn addition to sharing SAT/AP/ACT results with UNSW via the College Board portal, students must submit a letter from their school meeting the following minimum criteria:\n\nprinted on official school letterhead\nbears the official seal of the school\nincludes the student’s full name and date of birth\nspecifies the current stage of study (e.g., Year 11/12)\nstates the expected graduation date\nspecifies the name of the final award or test (e.g., US High School Diploma, Chinese High School Graduation Certificate, Indonesian SMA Certificate)\n\nEligibility\nThis assessment policy is only available for students completing Year 12 high school qualifications recognised by UNSW for direct entry.

UNSW is unable to share this information with applicants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Will there be additional offers made outside of the scheduled grouped offer rounds for the high-demand programs? \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUNSW reserves the right to make ad-hoc offers to exceptional applicants outside of the grouped offer rounds. We will also continue to make offers via UAC for relevant students, with entry ranks reflecting grouped offer round cut-offs. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                I need to complete the 10 or 15-week University English Entry Course (UEEC) before studying at UNSW.

Once you have the deferred offer, it should be provided to UNSW College Admissions, who can issue an updated offer for your English course. Please note, deferral requests are not guaranteed to be approved. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Is UNSW still making offers through UAC International?\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUNSW expects to make a number of offers through UAC for International Students. The majority of these offers will be made in the UAC December Round 2 offer round for 2026 intake.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Will UNSW issue conditional offers?\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUNSW will release conditional offers based on English language results during regular offer rounds. These offers will include an expiry deadline by which students must meet the conditions - either by submitting their English test results or enrolling in UNSW College’s UEEC program.\nStudents who are completing an approved external English language program can request an extension of their offer expiry deadline until their course is finished. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Can I defer my offer?\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents seeking to defer their offer to study at UNSW (before accepting) may submit an offer deferral request via the following channels:\n\nStudents with full offers can now request a deferral via Accept Online.\nStudents with conditional offers can submit a deferral request via the Ask Admissions online form.\n\nPlease note that offer deferral is not guaranteed and requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

As a result, we expect that there may be longer visa processing times for students submitting visa applications to study at UNSW Sydney.  \nTo avoid delays on your study plan, we encourage you to submit your visa application to the Australian Government as soon as you receive a Confirmation of Enrolment (COE) from us.\nFor more information about applying for an Australian Student Visa, please visit this page.\nImportant update on Australian Student Visa processing time\nThe Australian Government has recently changed its approach to processing student visas for those students intending to study at higher educational, vocational and training institutions.

UNSW now accepts predicted grades for full offers for the following qualifications:\n\nInternational Baccalaureate (IB)\nA-Levels\nIndian CBSE\nSingapore A-levels\nNCUK\nSouth African NSC\n\nStudents who are completing an approved external English language program can request an extension of their offer deadline until their course is finished.\nKey considerations:\n\nA buffer of 2 points above the standard entry requirement is required for a full offer based on predicted grades. Offers will only be issued where this is met or exceeded and all other requirements have been met.\nStudents must provide final results when available, and no later than the UNSW term commencement date.\nIf final results do not meet program entry requirements, students may need to:\ntransfer to a program with lower requirements, or\nexplore pathway options such as UNSW College Diplomas, or\nseek study alternatives outside UNSW\n\n\n\nRequired documentation:\nForecast results must be presented in the following format:\n\nBe printed on official school letterhead and include the institution stamp and signature of the Principal, Registrar or Academic Director.\nBe dated after 1 May for Term 1 (February intake) and 1 November of the previous year for Term 3 (September intake).\nFor IB Forecast only: IB Forecast results have the total predicted score as well as the individual scores for each subject.\nThe total predicted aggregate must be the equivalent of 2 points higher than the total final aggregate required for admission.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                What are the eligibility criteria and additional requirements for UNSW applicants holding SAT, AP, or ACT results?\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents who meet program entry requirements based on their SAT, AP, or ACT results are now eligible to receive a full or conditional on English offer ahead of their final high school result and proof of and completion of high school studies. Results and proof of high school completion will be required no later than the UNSW term commencement date and must be submitted as soon as they become available. This change aims to support students in lodging timely visa applications and re-establishes opportunity to commence their undergraduate studies as planned.\nAdditional requirement – enrolment or expected graduation letter\nIn addition to sharing SAT/AP/ACT results with UNSW via the College Board portal, students must submit a letter from their school meeting the following minimum criteria:\n\nprinted on official school letterhead\nbears the official seal of the school\nincludes the student’s full name and date of birth\nspecifies the current stage of study (e.g., Year 11/12)\nstates the expected graduation date\nspecifies the name of the final award or test (e.g., US High School Diploma, Chinese High School Graduation Certificate, Indonesian SMA Certificate)\n\nEligibility\nThis assessment policy is only available for students completing Year 12 high school qualifications recognised by UNSW for direct entry.

As a result, we expect that there may be longer visa processing times for students submitting visa applications to study at UNSW Sydney.  \nTo avoid delays on your study plan, we encourage you to submit your visa application to the Australian Government as soon as you receive a Confirmation of Enrolment (COE) from us.\nFor more information about applying for an Australian Student Visa, please visit this page.\nImportant update on Australian Student Visa processing time\nThe Australian Government has recently changed its approach to processing student visas for those students intending to study at higher educational, vocational and training institutions.

Students will need a weighted average mark (WAM) of 5 points above the advertised level to be eligible with 6/8 semesters studied, or a weighted average mark (WAM) of 2 points above the advertised level to be eligible with 7/8 or 5/6 semesters studied.\nApplicants who do not meet this rank will be placed on hold and may be made an offer once they upload their final results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Will UNSW accept predicted grades for full undergraduate offers?\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have altered our policy around predicted grades to widen the qualifications that we accept and have improved the process of assessment. UNSW now accepts predicted grades for full offers for the following qualifications:\n\nInternational Baccalaureate (IB)\nA-Levels\nIndian CBSE\nSingapore A-levels\nNCUK\nSouth African NSC\n\nStudents who are completing an approved external English language program can request an extension of their offer deadline until their course is finished.\nKey considerations:\n\nA buffer of 2 points above the standard entry requirement is required for a full offer based on predicted grades. Offers will only be issued where this is met or exceeded and all other requirements have been met.\nStudents must provide final results when available, and no later than the UNSW term commencement date.\nIf final results do not meet program entry requirements, students may need to:\ntransfer to a program with lower requirements, or\nexplore pathway options such as UNSW College Diplomas, or\nseek study alternatives outside UNSW\n\n\n\nRequired documentation:\nForecast results must be presented in the following format:\n\nBe printed on official school letterhead and include the institution stamp and signature of the Principal, Registrar or Academic Director.\nBe dated after 1 May for Term 1 (February intake) and 1 November of the previous year for Term 3 (September intake).\nFor IB Forecast only: IB Forecast results have the total predicted score as well as the individual scores for each subject.\nThe total predicted aggregate must be the equivalent of 2 points higher than the total final aggregate required for admission.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                What are the eligibility criteria and additional requirements for UNSW applicants holding SAT, AP, or ACT results?\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents who meet program entry requirements based on their SAT, AP, or ACT results are now eligible to receive a full or conditional on English offer ahead of their final high school result and proof of and completion of high school studies.
