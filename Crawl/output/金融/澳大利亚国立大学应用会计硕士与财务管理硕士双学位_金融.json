Prerequisites can include a high school subject or a university unit of study, which would be required to study that program or course in a program.\nThis is a grouping of schools according to academic disciplines, where academic staff teach at undergraduate, graduate and higher degree levels and pursue research and scholarly investigations.\nThey are University approved accommodation.  To find out more, visit the Residential and Campus Communities website.\nAustralian Tertiary Admissions Rank. The figure used by universities and tertiary applications centres such as UAC/VTAC to calculate the university entrance rank.This is then used to determine eligibility for admission to undergraduate courses. This is not a mark, but rank in comparison to other students.\nAn area within a program that allows in-depth study in a particular field. A major usually consists of a set number of related courses. Majors at ANU require 48 units.Example: The Marketing Major requires 48 units of courses specified under the requirements for the Marketing Major.\nA minor has fewer requirements to fulfil than a major, in terms of points and compulsory courses. Minors at ANU require 24 units.Example: The French Minor requires 24 units of courses specified under the requirements for the French Minor.\nSimilar to minors, specialisations are areas of studies with their own courses that are allowed to be taken in conjunction with a specific related major.Example: The Astronomy and Astrophysics specialisation requires 24 units of courses and is available to students who complete a Physics Major, Theoretical Physics Major, Mathematics Major or Mathematical Modelling Major.\nAn optional area of study selected in addition to the core courses of the program. Electives may allow you to delve more deeply into an area of study, or focus on an alternative area of interest that you may have. Many people will use electives to complete an additional major or minor.\nEach university has different terminology to describe their programs and the specific requirements of those programs. Some of these terms are “units”, “subjects” and “courses”, and whilst some terms are interchangeable, at ANU there is a general understanding of what these terms mean:>> Course: An area of study usually of one semester in length. Each course is normally assigned a unit value.Example: COMP1100 Introduction to Programming and Algorithms.>> Unit: a unit is an indicator of the value of a course – most courses are valued at 6 units.\nSome institutions assume that you have knowledge of specified courses or equivalent before beginning your course. If you do not have the assumed level of knowledge, but have met the admission requirements you may still be selected for the course, but you may have some difficulty coping with your studies. You may need to do a bridging course if you do not have the assumed level of knowledge.\nThese courses are designed to help you to get up to speed if you lack the assumed knowledge to start your program. They offer students the opportunity to revise and extend their knowledge in specific areas – often in chemistry, mathematics and physics. While they are strongly recommended for commencing students, they are not prerequisites.\nResponsible Officer: Registrar, Student Administration / Page Contact: Website Administrator / Frequently Asked Questions\n• Search ANU web, staff & maps\n\nSearch current site content\n• Search current site content\n• Programs and Courses\n• Frequently Asked Questions",
