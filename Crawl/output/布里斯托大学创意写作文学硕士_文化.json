In warm, supportive workshops, you will be helped to improve your writing and in lectures and seminars you will increase your understanding of the industrial and critical contexts of contemporary literature.\nYou will be taught by experienced published writers in extended workshop sessions, where you will be supported to experiment, innovate, and improve your work. This is the heart of the degree, where you develop your understanding of readership and how to create immersive writing that is engaging and memorable.\nA special unit introduces you to issues in contemporary publishing, where guest writers and experts from industry bring up-to-date knowledge and expertise to the programme. This unit is tailored to student need and designed to help you understand exactly how to begin trying to publish your work.\nWelcomed into the University's prestigious Department of English, you'll learn about contemporary critical issues that influence the world of literature. You will be encouraged to read widely and books will be suggested for you by faculty. Over the summer, you'll work with a professional writer to develop your manuscript, just as you would with an agent or editor.\nBy the end of the programme, you should understand a great deal about the critical and commercial context of your writing. You should be able to speak confidently and intelligently about your work and where it belongs.\nTwilight teaching allows people with working or caring responsibilities to study – as do the part-time options. A strong writing portfolio will allow access without a first degree in a related subject – or indeed without a first degree. Times of classes will be announced well in advance, so that students can accommodate study in their busy lives. These elements make for diverse, exciting classroom experiences.\nAlso diverse is the students' work. Of course, we support literary fiction and poets in the British tradition. But we also support genre – including sci-fi, fantasy, mystery and thriller. We support writing for young readers, romance, comedy, poems of all descriptions, and recently supported a graphic novel script.\nHear directly from an academic giving you a deeper insight into this programme.\nFor full-time students, in the first term:\nIn the second term:\nThis is followed by the Creative Dissertation (60 Credits) over the summer period.\nTwo years part-time study requires attendance at one seminar in the first teaching block (TB1) and one seminar in the second teaching block (TB2). In the second year, the two years part-time study option requires attendance at one seminar in TB1, one seminar in TB2, and tutorials over the summer period.\nThree years part-time study requires attendance at one seminar in TB1 and one seminar in TB2 in the first year. In the second year, it again requires attendance at one seminar in TB1 and one seminar in TB2. The third year of study requires the student to attend tutorials only.\nVisit our programme catalogue for full details of the structure and unit content for our MA Creative Writing.\nThe University of Bristol is ranked fifth for research in the UK (Times Higher Education).\n94% of our research assessed as world-leading or internationally excellent.\nYou will typically need an upper second-class honours degree or an international equivalent in English Literature, Drama, or Creative Writing.\nNonstandard routes are considered as places are primarily offered on the basis of a portfolio of writing. We are looking for writers with potential to soon begin publishing their work.\nIt is helpful, but not essential, for the applicant to have some idea of the project they hope to undertake during the course of the degree. Evidence of prior study in the area, a long-standing writing practice, workshop experience, and extensive reading can also strengthen the application. However, the most essential element of the application is the writing itself.\nWe are currently only accepting submissions for fiction, creative non-fiction (for example, memoir), and poetry. The portfolio should be no longer than 10 pages of fiction or creative non-fiction (double spaced, 12-point font) or 4-5 poems.\nIf you are currently completing a degree, we understand that your final grade may be higher than the interim grades or module/unit grades you have achieved during your studies to date. We will consider your application if your interim grades are currently slightly lower than the programme's entry requirements and may make you an aspirational offer. This offer would be at the standard level, so you would need to achieve the standard entry requirements by the end of your degree. Specific module requirements would still apply.\nWe will also consider your application if your final overall achieved grade is slightly lower than the programme's entry requirement.\nIf you have at least one of the following, please include your CV (curriculum vitae / résumé) when you apply, showing details of your relevant qualifications:\nEvidence of significant, relevant work experience:\nWork experience duration: Any\nPaid/unpaid: Both\nAcceptable sectors:\nSee international equivalent qualifications on the International Office website.\nRead the programme admissions statement for important information on entry requirements, the application process and supporting documents required.\nIf English is not your first language, you will need to reach the requirements outlined in our profile level A.\nFurther information about English language requirements and profile levels.\nFees are subject to an annual review. For programmes that last longer than one year, please budget for up to an 8% increase in fees each year.\nMore about tuition fees, living costs and financial support.\nUniversity of Bristol students and graduates can benefit from a 25% reduction in tuition fees for postgraduate study. Check your eligibility for an alumni discount.\nMyWorld Scholarships: UK offer holders for this programme may be eligible for a scholarship of up to £5,000 towards their tuition fees. Information about eligibility and the application process can be found on the MyWorld website.\nCreative writing is among the subjects eligible for funding from the Postgraduate Master's Loan. The Faculty of Arts, Law and Social Sciences also offers funding opportunities for taught and research programmes.\nInternational students are encouraged to apply for the Think Big Postgraduate Scholarship.\nFurther information on funding for prospective UK and international postgraduate students.\nGraduates of the MA in Creative Writing often enter portfolio careers, where creative writing becomes only one element of their income. Other elements may include:\nThe close-reading skills developed on a master's in creative writing can also prepare graduates for careers in publishing. Advanced skills in understanding nuance and tone have helped graduates secure work in business communications, marketing and corporate social media.\nApply via our online application system.
