The master’s program in Mathematics in Science and Engineering gives students, in four semesters, all the tools they will need for a career in the interdisciplinary field of software and engineering, in the development departments of medium-sized and large companies, or in scientific and engineering research institutes.\nType of Study: Full-time\nStandard Duration of Studies: 4 semesters\nCredits: 120 ECTS\nMain Location: Garching\nStart of Degree Program: summer or winter semester\nLanguage of Instruction: English\nCosts: Semester fees, tuition fees for international students\nProfessional Profile: Mathematics\nThe focus of the master’s program is on providing students with a broad mathematical education in mathematical modeling, numerical mathematics, applied analysis, optimization and stochastics. Students participating in the program select an area of specialization in engineering or natural sciences in agreement with their academic advisor.\nThe flexible structure of the program allows students to study abroad for one or two semesters at one of TUM's partner universities. The master's thesis in the fourth semester concludes the program.\nAs a graduate of the program, you will be able to turn engineering and scientific problems into mathematical models, analyze them mathematically while taking the engineering context into account, and communicate the results obtained in an interdisciplinary and comprehensible way to team colleagues.\nIn the program, you will be able to expand your portfolio of multidisciplinary soft skills and acquire methodological knowledge as well as in-depth knowledge in the core mathematical subjects and the application focus area you select.\nAs a graduate in the master’s program in Mathematics in Science and Engineering, you will be ideally prepared for an interdisciplinary professional field in the software and technology industries. Graduates also have additional prospects in the development departments of companies or in scientific or engineering research institutes.\nThe master’s program in Mathematics in Science and Engineering follows a bachelor’s degree in mathematics, engineering mathematics, physics or similar disciplines. It is helpful for applicants with an engineering degree if they have taken additional lectures in mathematics, such as optimization or numerics.\nThe minimum requirements for a master’s degree at TUM are an undergraduate degree (e.g., bachelor’s degree) and successful completion of the aptitude assessment process, in which applicants can demonstrate their individual talent and motivation.\nWinter semester: 1 January to 31 May\nSummer semester: 1 October to 30 November\nThe application can be submitted via our portal TUMonline. After creating your account please enter your personal data and educational information and upload the required documents. Applications must be submitted electronically.\nOnly if you have been accepted, you will have to submit some additional documents as certified copies in paper form for enrollment. Applicants with an international higher education entrance qualification (\"Bildungsausländer:innen\") usually must have their documents reviewed in advance via uni-assist.\nHow to apply for a Master's Degree Program – Step by Step\nProspective students who have not earned their qualification to pursue a master’s degree (e.g. bachelor’s degree) at a German university will need to have their graduation certificates and transcript checked in advance by uni-assist before submitting their online application. Since this can take up to four weeks, it is strongly recommended to initiate this process at an early stage.\nOn the TUM website you will find detailed information for international applicants.\nFor your application please upload the following documents in TUMonline:\nFor more information on all required documents, see the Document Glossary of the Technical University of Munich. Depending on your previous education and origin, we may require additional application documents. You will be informed which documents these are via TUMonline during the online application process.\nApplicants are selected through an aptitude assessment process. It is a two-step process in which we check your official application to see whether you fulfill the specific requirements for the master’s program in Mathematics in Science and Engineering.\nIn the first stage, we evaluate the final grade and written documents using a point system. Depending on the score, applicants are either immediately admitted, rejected, or invited to an aptitude assessment interview.\nTo be accepted to the TUM master’s program in mathematics, applicants must have a qualified university degree in\nThe equivalency and comparability of programs that are not listed will only be decided during the application process. Unfortunately, it is not possible to make any statements on this in advance.\nAdditionally, proof of suitable competencies is required, as listed on the checklist to the extent indicated. If applicants fail to meet these requirements by only a narrow margin, they will receive a point deduction in the application procedure. If too much is missing, this will lead to the application being rejected.\nDetailed information on the selection process can be found in Appendix 2 of the FPSO.\nAnother requirement is adequate proficiency in the English language. If your official language of education was not English, you will need a recognized language certificate. If you have previously written your graded thesis in English or can prove that you have completed at least 10 credits in English-language examination modules, you are considered to have demonstrated adequate proficiency in English.\nThe aptitude interview is conducted in English either in an in-person meeting in Garching or as a web conference. It lasts 20 to 30 minutes. The interview focuses on the applicant's knowledge of the subject from their first degree, their motivation, and their ability to work scientifically or in a fundamentally and methodologically oriented manner.\nAptitude interviews for applications for the summer semester take place between January and March, for the winter semester between June and September. Invitations are sent out at least one week in advance. The exact time of the aptitude interview depends on the time the application is being processed. The earlier an application is received in full, the earlier we can process it.\nOnce you have received an acceptance letter and have accepted the place in your TUMonline account, you will be required to pay the tuition fees and submit the documents necessary for enrollment. Among other things, this includes the signed application for enrollment on paper, the certified degree diploma, and the certified degree certificate. You will find the list of required documents in your TUMonline account. Please be aware that your matriculation will only be effected after you have successfully submitted these documents.\nPlease check which modules, if any, you can have recognized from your Bachelor's program and where you have to submit the request for recognition of examination credits.\nThe qualification profile of the master's program in Mathematics in Science and Engineering consists of individual modules that you can combine freely for the most part. During your studies, you will have to earn a total of 120 credits from the following areas:\nYou can find a list of all modules that are relevant for the program with details on course times and rooms, in the degree chart on TUMonline.

If the document is required for your application, you need to apply for a VPD via uni-assist as well as apply to TUM directly via TUMonline.\nAn application for a VPD via uni-assist alone does not qualify as an application for a degree program at TUM. An application via TUMonline is always necessary.\nUni-assist performs preliminary processing and evaluation of the applicant's university entrance qualification (for bachelor's) or master qualification materials (for master's), running a check of the applicants’ certificates to determine which grades they have on the German grading system. This preliminary documentation (VPD) informs applicants whether they qualify to study all subjects (general qualification), only certain subjects (subject-restricted qualification) or postgradual studies (master's).\nIn addition, the VPD contains a conversion of all your credits and grades into the German grading system or the ECTS grading system.\nCheck the visa regulations that apply to you – and be sure to contact the German embassy in your country well in advance. If you do need a visa, you can now plan your application free of charge using the VisaFlow app. Just use the code “TUM25”. Please note that VisaFlow is an external service provider. For technical or content-related questions, please contact the VisaFlow team directly.\nFor a Bachelor’s:\nFor a Master’s:\nYou need to apply for a preliminary documentation (VPD) via the uni-assist web portal.

Not required are, for example, a copy of the ID, motivation letters, essays or language certificates.\nThe application is not complete until all required documents have been uploaded to the uni-assist website and the handling fees have been paid to uni-assist. The documents and the payment must reach uni-assist before the respective application deadline – otherwise the VPD has not been applied for in due time.\nFor the evaluation of your certificates, uni-assist charges handling fees.

Otherwise, your application cannot be processed.\nPlease upload the signed form “Confirmation that the application for a preliminary review documentation by uni-assist has been submitted in due form and time” in TUMonline instead of the final VPD. With this form you confirm to TUM that you have applied for the VPD in due time.\nThe form serves as a placeholder until you can upload the final VPD. It is mandatory to upload it until you can replace it with the upload of the final VPD.\nIf you have uploaded all admission-relevant documents in your application in TUMonline by the deadline, your documents will be checked.\nIf you have not yet uploaded a final VPD, the form will be given the status “not ok” as a placeholder so that you can replace it with the final VPD.\nPlease read the explanation for the status “not ok” in your TUMonline application.The status “not ok” mostly just means that you still need to replace the document with the final VPD once you have it.\nIf you have applied for the VPD in time and in full, you will be given a grace period.

It is designed for students who are interested in mathematics as an exact science.\nThe minimum requirements for a master’s degree at TUM are an undergraduate degree (e.g., bachelor’s degree) and successful completion of the aptitude assessment process, in which applicants can demonstrate their individual talent and motivation.\nWinter semester: 1 January to 31 May\nSummer semester: 1 October to 30 November\nThe application can be submitted via our portal TUMonline. After creating your account please enter your personal data and educational information and upload the required documents. Applications must be submitted electronically.\nOnly if you have been accepted, you will have to submit some additional documents as certified copies in paper form for enrollment. Applicants with an international higher education entrance qualification (\"Bildungsausländer:innen\") usually must have their documents reviewed in advance via uni-assist.\nHow to apply for a Master's Degree Program – Step by Step\nProspective students who have not earned their qualification to pursue a master’s degree (e.g. bachelor’s degree) at a German university will need to have their graduation certificates and transcript checked in advance by uni-assist before submitting their online application. Since this can take up to four weeks, it is strongly recommended to initiate this process at an early stage.\nOn the TUM website you will find detailed information for international applicants.\nFor your application please upload the following documents in TUMonline:\nFor more information on all required documents, see the Document Glossary of the Technical University of Munich. Depending on your previous education and origin, we may require additional application documents. You will be informed which documents these are via TUMonline during the online application process.\nApplicants are selected through an aptitude assessment process. It is a two-step process in which we check your official application to see whether you fulfill the specific requirements for the master’s program in mathematics.\nIn the first stage, we evaluate the final grade and written documents using a point system. Depending on the score, applicants are either immediately admitted, rejected, or invited to an aptitude assessment interview.\nTo be accepted to the TUM master’s program in mathematics, applicants must have a qualified university degree in\nThe equivalency and comparability of programs that are not listed will only be decided during the application process. Unfortunately, it is not possible to make any statements on this in advance.\nAdditionally, proof of suitable competencies is required, as listed on the checklist to the extent indicated. If applicants fail to meet these requirements by only a narrow margin, they will receive a point deduction in the application procedure. If too much is missing, this will lead to the application being rejected.\nDetailed information on the selection process can be found in Appendix 2 of the FPSO.\nAnother requirement is adequate proficiency in the English language. If your official language of education was not English, you will need a recognized language certificate. If you have previously written your graded thesis in English or can prove that you have completed at least 10 credits in English-language examination modules, you are considered to have demonstrated adequate proficiency in English.\nThe aptitude interview is conducted in English either in an in-person meeting in Garching or as a web conference. It lasts 20 to 30 minutes. The interview focuses on the applicant's knowledge of the subject from their first degree, their motivation, and their ability to work scientifically or in a fundamentally and methodologically oriented manner.\nAptitude interviews for applications for the summer semester take place between January and March, for the winter semester between June and September. Invitations are sent out at least one week in advance. The exact time of the aptitude interview depends on the time the application is being processed. The earlier an application is received in full, the earlier we can process it.\nOnce you have received an acceptance letter and have accepted the place in your TUMonline account, you will be required to pay the tuition fees and submit the documents necessary for enrollment. Among other things, this includes the signed application for enrollment on paper, the certified degree diploma, and the certified degree certificate. You will find the list of required documents in your TUMonline account. Please be aware that your matriculation will only be effected after you have successfully submitted these documents.\nPlease check which modules, if any, you can have recognized from your Bachelor's program and where you have to submit the request for recognition of examination credits.\nThe qualification profile of the master's program in Mathematics consists of individual modules that you can combine freely for the most part.

in the winter semester of 2024/25.\nOn this page, you can find out who these tuition fees apply to and how TUM uses them to improve studying and teaching for all students.\nFrom the winter semester 2024/25, tuition fees for international students from third countries will only be charged for newly enrolled students in Bachelor's and Master's degree programs.\nAs a leading international university, the Technical University of Munich is committed to offering our talented students the best possible conditions to develop their skills and personalities. Every year, more and more young people from all over the world place their trust in the opportunities that TUM offers them for their future. We want to continue to live up to this trust and give our students access to outstanding education and training.\nTo achieve this, it is essential to offer not only outstanding personalities in research and teaching, but also the highest standards of infrastructure, equipment, study areas, management, and support for our students. Within Germany and the EU, there are mechanisms and agreements in place that allow the financing of studies from public funds. In order to enable international students from third countries who are not part of this education system to study at TUM, we charge fees for international students from third countries. These fees benefit all students by ensuring sustainable and excellent study and learning conditions.\nAll international students from third countries must pay tuition fees from winter semester 2024/25 if they enroll in a new degree program at TUM.\nThe following groups are exempt from tuition fees:\nFamily members of EU citizens with the right of permanent residence\nPersons with an established domestic connection, regardless of their citizenship. Established domestic connection means\nYou have lived in Germany for a total of at least 5 years before starting your studies and were regularly employed or\nat least one parent has been in Germany for a total of at least 3 years during the last 6 years and was regularly employed.\nStudents with disabilities\nForeign nationals with a residence permit\nStudents seeking asylum who are nationals of a country with a special protection quota can have their tuition fees for international students from third countries waived on application. Further information can be found on the site on scholarships and waivers.  \tPlease note: Persons entitled to asylum and recognized refugees are not automatically exempt from the obligation to pay tuition fees based on this status. However, if they are not exempt from the obligation to pay fees due to an established domestic connection, you can apply for a waiver due to social reaseons, which will be considered favorably. Further information can be found on the site on scholarships and waivers.\nStudents in the following programs are also exempt from tuition fees:\nPlease note: Different regulations continue to apply for executive degree programs.\nThere are opportunities for particularly high-achieving or needy students to receive a scholarship or apply for a waiver of fees.\nTo get an initial assessment of whether you are subject to tuition fees, you can use the tuition compass.\nThe tuition fees usually amount to\nYou can find a list with the fees for each program here.\nIf you are enrolled in two degree programs at the same time (parallel studies), tuition fees apply for both programs.\nIrrespective of the tuition fees, the semester fees must also be paid.\nThe tuition fees for international students from third countries will be charged from winter semester 2024/25 for new enrollment in a degree program at TUM.\nAll students who are already enrolled in a degree program at TUM before winter semester 2024/25 do not have to pay tuition fees for their further studies in this degree program.\nThe payment deadline for first-time enrollment for the summer semester is March 15, for the winter semester September 15.\nThe payment deadline for re-enrollment for the summer semester is February 15, for the winter semester August 15.\nYour transfer will appear in your TUMonline contribution account within approximately 5 business days.

From this guide, the respective module content and the skills taught must emerge. For the verification of your qualification it must be clear what skills you have acquired in the relevant subjects. A transcript with lecture titles only is not enough! The course guide must be written in English or German.\nIf your university does not provide an official course guide in English or German, please submit a written confirmation to this fact. In that case we propose that you compile the contents of all relevant courses. Do you have lecture scripts from your professors? A copy of a detailed table of contents would be good. Often there are official descriptions of lectures on the university's website. If so, please give us a list of links.\nIf your course guide is only available in a language other than German or English, please attach the original guide as a pdf file or the links to the online version. A course guide written by yourself should bear a signature from one of your professors with a stamp of the university.",
