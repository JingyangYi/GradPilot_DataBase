It will help you to develop a wide range of mathematical techniques and gives you a solid foundation for further research or employment at the highest levels.\nUnder the guidance of an academic mentor, you will be offered a choice of units spanning the breadth of mathematics. There is a wide variety of combinations of units and themes, allowing you to add units from other schools to create an MSc that closely matches your interests. The taught element is followed by your chosen research project, which is supervised by an experienced research academic.\nThe programme gives you the opportunity to increase your understanding of mathematical theory and equips you with fundamental skills in the modelling and analysis of problems. Our graduates are highly sought after by employers for their strong analytical, communication and organisational skills.\nHear directly from an academic giving you a deeper insight into this programme.\nThe MSc in Mathematical Sciences comprises a taught component and a research project.\nThere is an extensive range of possible combinations of units and themes. An academic mentor will advise you on unit selection and meet regularly with you individually or in small groups throughout the taught component. You are also encouraged to participate in the wider academic life of the school, including research seminars, reading clubs and social events.\nVisit our programme catalogue for full details of the structure and unit content for our MSc in Mathematical Sciences.\nThe University of Bristol is ranked fifth for research in the UK (Times Higher Education).\n94% of our research assessed as world-leading or internationally excellent.\nYou will typically need a strong upper second-class honours degree (65% or higher) or an international equivalent in Mathematics or a very closely related subject such as Mathematical Physics / Maths and Statistics / Statistics and Maths / Maths and Applied Maths / Applied Maths and Maths.\nA joint honours degree in Mathematics, such as Maths with Economics / Finance / Physics / Statistics / Computer Science / Philosophy etc. may be considered if there is sufficient theoretical mathematics content at 65% (or international equivalent).\nIf you are currently completing a degree, we understand that your final grade may be higher than the interim grades or module/unit grades you have achieved during your studies to date.\nWe will consider your application if your interim grades are currently slightly lower than the programme's entry requirements and may make you an aspirational offer. This offer would be at the standard level, so you would need to achieve the standard entry requirements by the end of your degree. Specific module requirements would still apply.\nWe will also consider your application if your final overall achieved grade is slightly lower than the programme's entry requirement. If you have a relevant postgraduate qualification from one of the accepted subjects listed above, please include your CV (curriculum vitae / résumé) when you apply, showing details of your relevant qualifications.\nSpecific module requirements would still apply.\nSee international equivalent qualifications on the International Office website.\nRead the programme admissions statement for important information on entry requirements, the application process and supporting documents required.\nIf English is not your first language, you will need to reach the requirements outlined in our profile level E.\nFurther information about English language requirements and profile levels.\nFees are subject to an annual review. For programmes that last longer than one year, please budget for up to an 8% increase in fees each year.\nMore about tuition fees, living costs and financial support.\nUniversity of Bristol students and graduates can benefit from a 25% reduction in tuition fees for postgraduate study. Check your eligibility for an alumni discount.\nFurther information on funding for prospective UK and international postgraduate students.\nThis programme provides you with skills in quantitative research, reasoning and problem solving that will be valuable in your future career. Mathematics graduates often go on to PhD programmes or find employment in finance, accountancy, research, teaching or management.\nApply via our online application system. For further information, please see the guidance for how to apply on our webpages.\nOverseas applicants: 25 July 2025. Home applicants: 8 August 2025.\nPlease note that due to high demand, some programmes may close earlier than advertised. Early applications are advised to avoid disappointment.
