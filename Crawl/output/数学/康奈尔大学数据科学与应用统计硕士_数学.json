Our students join in a tradition of success, and graduates are employed in data science and applied statistics careers worldwide in diverse fields from finance to artificial intelligence to biomedical research.\nThe master’s in data science and applied statistics is for those interested in professional careers related to business, industry, government, or scientific research and provides rigorous training in modern data analytical skills that are sought after in almost any field. Cornell is the only Ivy League University that provides such a program.\nThis program is recognized as a Professional Science Master's (PSM) program, approved by the Council of Graduate Schools.\nThe MPS Program has two options:\nOption I - Statistical Analysis\nThis option places emphasis on the techniques of statistical analysis.\nOption II - Data Science\nAlong with statistical techniques, this option emphasizes computer science including high-performance computing, databases, middleware, and scripting.\nRegardless of which option you choose, the MPS program has three main components:\nThe MPS program can be completed in two semesters and readies students for careers in fields where modern data analysis skills are highly coveted.\nThe application for the MPS in Data Science and Applied Statistics is open to any major as long as students meet the minimum mathematical background necessary to keep up with coursework. However, space is limited and preference is given to those with a stronger mathematical background and the equivalent of an undergraduate degree in one or more of the following areas:\nStudents are expected to complete the program in two semesters. While exceptions are sometimes made, attending for a third semester is not guaranteed.\nCornell University's Data Science and Applied Statistics Master of Professional Studies (MPS) program is designed to provide its students with high levels of technical training in data science and statistics that can be used in nearly all facets of industry.\nDue to its mathematical rigor, graduates of this master’s program are exceptionally qualified for most quantitative or data-driven positions. Such positions can include, but are not limited to: industrial engineer, mathematician, operations research analyst, quantitative analyst, data scientist, research scientist, or statistician.\n• Required common and option-specific core courses\n• An in-depth statistical analysis MPS project supported by the core courses\n• Required coursework, including a two-semester course sequence in mathematical probability and statistics, and elective coursework selected from offerings in the Department of Statistics and Data Science and other departments at Cornell\n• Statistics\n• Applied Mathematics\n• Engineering\n• Computer Science\n[GRID_TABLE]\nA Stats student at computer\nA Stats student at computer\nA Stats student at computer\n[CARD]\nA Stats student at computer",

Is there a spring application deadline?\n[HEADING] Does the MPS Statistics program qualify as a STEM program?\n[HEADING] Can you please tell me if I am qualified to apply/ a good candidate?\n[HEADING] Application status (after review)\nRequired TOEFL scores are assigned and reviewed by the Cornell Graduate School.  Currently the minimum TOEFL scores of the Internet-Based Test (iBT) version are:\nThese scores are required for the application by the Cornell Graduate School. However if you have studied in the U.S. continuously for 2 years, the Graduate School can waive your TOEFL requirement. Living in the U.S. only does not apply to this exception. As for IELTS, Cornell Graduate School requires an overall band score of a 7.0 or higher. For more information (including eligibility for exemption from the TOEFL exam), please refer to the Cornell Graduate School.\nAs an international student, you would be required to have studied full-time for at least 2 academic years at an English-speaking University during the last five years. More information for exemptions to the TOEFL can be found on the Graduate School website.\nUp to 3 letters of recommendation may be uploaded with the application; 2 of which are required and must be academic. The third, optional letter of recommendation can be academic or professional. All application materials, including letters of recommendation, must be submitted online.\nThe program is intended for students with a quantitatively-oriented Bachelor's degree in the agricultural, biological, computer, engineering, mathematical, physical, social, or statistical sciences. Our application is open to any major as long as students meet the minimum mathematical background necessary to keep up with course work. These are:  two semesters of calculus, one semester of elementary non-calculus based statistics, a course in matrix algebra, and familiarity with standard computing tools (e.g., spreadsheets). To meet these prerequisite requirements, courses must be from an accredited college or university and be listed on an official transcript. However, space in the MPS program is limited and preference is given to applicants with more than the minimal mathematical background.\nThe length of time to complete the MPS program depends on a student’s preparation.  Most of our students have more extensive preparation for applied statistics and complete the MPS program in two semesters.  However, with only the minimum background needed for admission you may need to take three or, more likely, four semesters to complete the degree, taking prerequisites (e.g., additional calculus) in the first year.\nThe Department of Statistics and Data Science does not have cut-offs for GRE scores, even though they are still required. Your application is made up of many other parts (recommendations, transcript, etc.) that are reviewed before a decision is made.  We advise you to concentrate on making the whole application as strong as possible rather than concentrating on just one part of it.\nAs long as you have entered GRE institutional code for Cornell University (2098), you are not required to enter the specific department code. The Cornell system will eventually redirect your score to the right department. However, we suggest that you use 0704 as the department code for applying to the MPS program. If you used 0705, your application will be redirected to us as well.\nUnfortunately we do not accept GMAT scores as these are intended for business schools. If you wish to submit your GMAT scores you may add a scan as supplement on the application site. We still require GRE scores.\nThe MPS is intended for persons who want a short-term (1 year) Master's degree so as to go into business, industry, or government statistical work. At Cornell, if you want to go on for a PhD after the MPS you must apply as a new student to the PhD program; you would be considered as part of the pool of PhD applicants and, if admitted, you might be able to apply some of your MPS coursework but there is no guarantee. The PhD program in Statistics at Cornell enrolls about 4-6 students per year; the MPS, about 60-70 students per year.\nThe target time for completion of the PhD program is between 3 and 5 years; the actual time to completion varies by student.\nOfficially, there are no calculated demographics of the MPS classes. However, most of our students are international students with the majority coming from China. The MPS program enrolls between 60-70 students each year from various backgrounds.\nAll transcripts are required for the application. If you have taken courses at another university, regardless of whether or not the credits were transferred to your current university, the Department of Statistical Science requires that you scan the former transcript to your application online as it is the only way to see the grades received for the courses taken. You do not need to send a hard copy of the transcripts until after acceptance.\nPlease contact Collegenet.\nThe application deadline is February 1st.\nSpring admission is limited to Cornell undergraduates.  If you wish to apply for the spring semester, you should send an email to the program director, indicating that your application is for the Spring term. For questions, contact the Director of the MPS program, Dr. Xiaolong Yang.\nThis program qualifies as a STEM program making international students potentially eligible for a total of 36 months of Optional Practical Training (OPT) if all of the extension requirements are met.\nUnfortunately we do not pre-screen students. Only complete applications are reviewed.\nIf you do not see the Decision links on the application website, your current application status is either “Hold” or “Reject.” A “Hold” status means that you were not admitted in the first round of application review and that your application may be reviewed again if we still have space later. The application system does not have an option to reflect the “Hold” status. However, a “Reject” status will be posted on the application website soon.  We will also inform you of your application status via email as the admission process moves forward.\n• 15 Listening\n• 22 Speaking\n• 20 Reading\n• 20 Writing\n[GRID_TABLE]\nWhat are the required TOEFL and IELTS scores?

Please check Cornell's Class Roster when determining course availability.\nRequired courses for a student’s chosen option are listed below, as in the MPS Data Science and Applied Statistics Application to Graduate\nBoth options require a total of at least 30 credit hours in required courses and electives. The 30 required credit hours must be earned while an MPS student is enrolled in the MPS program; no transfer of credits from undergraduate study or another graduate program, etc. is allowed.\nAt most one elective course to be used toward the MPS degree can be taken S/U each semester.\nOption I students can take STSCI 5045, STSCI 5060, and STSCI 5065 as electives and may therefore take these courses S/U. For option II students, these courses are required and must be taken for a letter grade.\nA grade of C- or better (or S for S/U courses) is required for all courses used to meet MPS requirements.\nA GPA of 2.5 or higher in courses used toward the MPS degree is required for graduation.\nElectives must be taken from the list below of approved electives.\nStudents can ask the Director of the MPS Program to add courses to the list of electives. To be approved by the Director, a course must be a technical course numbered 5000 level or higher and have substantial statistics content. To submit a course waiver or application for a new elective to be counted toward your degree credits, please complete the Course Waiver - Application for Elective Form. If approved for the waiver over email please note the course you want to substitute for and email your approval or questions to aw269@cornell.edu.\nTwo courses covering similar material and at the same level cannot both be used toward the 30 credit hours for the MPS degree.\nThe MPS Program in Data Science and Applied Statistics at Cornell University is a one-year program. Under special circumstances, before the end of the first year, a student may formally request an extension of their study. Once the request for an extension form is complete, you will receive an email with additional information. The graduate school recommends that if the students are going to be requesting an extension of their F-1 status, it would be good to wait until their Expected Graduation Term (EGT) has been updated so that we can approve the F-1 Extension Form with the updated EGT.  Students do need to keep track of their F-1 end date so that their EGT is updated before the F-1 expires.\nOur MPS program is very demanding.  Every year we have MPS students who find that the intensive workload causes them much stress.  To improve their academic performance and health (including mental health), they often balance their workload and complete the MPS degree by extending their programs for a longer time. Such an extension is allowed as long as the university rules allow. However, an MPS student must complete his/her MPS degree in no longer than two years. Our Statistics and Data Science department requires all students to take 12 credits even in their extension semester because tuition reduction is not an option and it helps students meet degree requirements. In the extension semester only, not all the credits have to be MPS-eligible credits needed for the MPS Applied Statistics Master's Degree.\nPlease provide the new graduate date and a compelling academic reason that causes you as the student not to graduate as expected. List out the specific courses you plan to take in the extension semester.\nSome examples are: \n\t\t\t* \"I need to take STSCI 5080: Probability Models and Inferences because it's a Core Required Course and share why you didn't take the course in previous semesters.\"\n* \"I need to take STSCI 5040: R Programming for Data Science because I need 4 more credits to reach 12 Statistical credits for Option 1 and share why you didn't take the course in previous semesters.\" or\n* \"I need to take STSCI 5045: Python Programming and its Applications in Statistics to fulfill the requirements of Option 2 and share why you didn't take the course in previous semesters.\"\nWe need this information also listed on the F-1 immigration extension request form because it's a requirement and is kept in the student’s record in case we are audited by the government.\nFor an extension, regulations require that the delays are caused by compelling academic or medical reasons, such as changes of major or research topics, unexpected research problems, or documented illnesses. An extension cannot be done for sake of employment or for administrative purposes.\nIf you do not obtain an approved extension before the end date on your I-20 or DS-2019, you’ll be in violation of your immigration status.\nSTSCI 5030: Linear Models with Matrices (4 crs.)

Please check Cornell's Class Roster when determining course availability.\nDegree Requirements\nRequired courses for a student’s chosen option are listed below, as in the MPS Data Science and Applied Statistics Application to Graduate\n\n\nBoth options require a total of at least 30 credit hours in required courses and electives. The 30 required credit hours must be earned while an MPS student is enrolled in the MPS program; no transfer of credits from undergraduate study or another graduate program, etc. is allowed.\n\nAll required courses must be taken for a letter grade.\n\nAt most one elective course to be used toward the MPS degree can be taken S/U each semester.\n\n\nOption I students can take STSCI 5045, STSCI 5060, and STSCI 5065 as electives and may therefore take these courses S/U. For option II students, these courses are required and must be taken for a letter grade.\n\n\nA grade of C- or better (or S for S/U courses) is required for all courses used to meet MPS requirements.\n\n\nA GPA of 2.5 or higher in courses used toward the MPS degree is required for graduation.\n\n\nElectives must be taken from the list below of approved electives.\n\n\nStudents can ask the Director of the MPS Program to add courses to the list of electives. To be approved by the Director, a course must be a technical course numbered 5000 level or higher and have substantial statistics content. To submit a course waiver or application for a new elective to be counted toward your degree credits, please complete the Course Waiver - Application for Elective Form. If approved for the waiver over email please note the course you want to substitute for and email your approval or questions to aw269@cornell.edu. \n\n\nTwo courses covering similar material and at the same level cannot both be used toward the 30 credit hours for the MPS degree.\n\n\nThe MPS Program in Data Science and Applied Statistics at Cornell University is a one-year program. Under special circumstances, before the end of the first year, a student may formally request an extension of their study. Once the request for an extension form is complete, you will receive an email with additional information. The graduate school recommends that if the students are going to be requesting an extension of their F-1 status, it would be good to wait until their Expected Graduation Term (EGT) has been updated so that we can approve the F-1 Extension Form with the updated EGT.  Students do need to keep track of their F-1 end date so that their EGT is updated before the F-1 expires.\nOur MPS program is very demanding.  Every year we have MPS students who find that the intensive workload causes them much stress.  To improve their academic performance and health (including mental health), they often balance their workload and complete the MPS degree by extending their programs for a longer time. Such an extension is allowed as long as the university rules allow. However, an MPS student must complete his/her MPS degree in no longer than two years. Our Statistics and Data Science department requires all students to take 12 credits even in their extension semester because tuition reduction is not an option and it helps students meet degree requirements. In the extension semester only, not all the credits have to be MPS-eligible credits needed for the MPS Applied Statistics Master's Degree.\nPlease provide the new graduate date and a compelling academic reason that causes you as the student not to graduate as expected. List out the specific courses you plan to take in the extension semester.\n Some examples are: \n\t\t\t* \"I need to take STSCI 5080: Probability Models and Inferences because it's a Core Required Course and share why you didn't take the course in previous semesters.\"\n * \"I need to take STSCI 5040: R Programming for Data Science because I need 4 more credits to reach 12 Statistical credits for Option 1 and share why you didn't take the course in previous semesters.\" or\n\t\t\t* \"I need to take STSCI 5045: Python Programming and its Applications in Statistics to fulfill the requirements of Option 2 and share why you didn't take the course in previous semesters.\"\n\t\t\tWe need this information also listed on the F-1 immigration extension request form because it's a requirement and is kept in the student’s record in case we are audited by the government. \nFor an extension, regulations require that the delays are caused by compelling academic or medical reasons, such as changes of major or research topics, unexpected research problems, or documented illnesses. An extension cannot be done for sake of employment or for administrative purposes. \nIf you do not obtain an approved extension before the end date on your I-20 or DS-2019, you’ll be in violation of your immigration status. \n\n\nCore Required Courses\nSTSCI 5030: Linear Models with Matrices (4 crs.)
