During the first semester of study you’ll select your research topic and supervisor, with the research project usually beginning in the second semester.\nView some sample course plans to help you select subjects that will meet the requirements for this coursework.\nExplore the subjects you could choose as part of this degree.\nContact-support \n    How can we help?\n• Arrow-right  \n          #1\n         \n          university in Australia\n• Course code:\n         MC-SCIMAT\n• Discipline subjects (137.5 points), including compulsory subjects and electives\n• A professional skills subject (12.5 points)\n• A research project (50 points, or 25 points with approval and other subjects to compensate).\n• Applied Mathematics and Mathematical Biology\n• Operations Research and Industrial Optimisation\n• Pure Mathematics\n• Statistics and Stochastic Processes\n• Mathematical Physics and Physical Combinatorics\n[GRID_TABLE]\nArrow-right  \n        How to apply\nArrow-right  \n        Enquire\nArrow-right  \n        Register for updates\n[CARD]\nArrow-right  \n        Register for updates\n[CARD]\nArrow-right  \n        How to apply\n[CARD]\nArrow-right  \n        Enquire",

This applies even if you're studying abroad or have dual Australian citizenship.\nTo be considered for entry into this course, you must have an undergraduate degree (or equivalent) in a directly related discipline with a Weighted Average Mark (WAM) of at least 65% (or equivalent) in the best 50 points of appropriate discipline studies at third year.\nAppropriate discipline studies include Mathematics, Statistics, Applied Mathematics, Mathematical Physics (or equivalents).\nMeeting the published entry requirements for this course does not guarantee selection.\nWhere our admission criteria includes a minimum Weighted Average Mark (WAM) and/or specific subject criteria, these are based on University of Melbourne grades and subjects. If you've studied elsewhere, we'll assess your relevant prior studies and equivalent grades. Your final WAM may be adjusted depending on your previous institution's accreditation, subject grading, and pass marks.\nYou can use our graduate coursework grade conversion eligibility calculator to get an indication of whether you are eligible for this course based on your previous studies and Weighted Average Mark (WAM).\nAll applicants to the University of Melbourne must satisfy the English language requirements. This may be achieved in a number of ways, including recognised previous study taught and assessed entirely in English or an approved English language test. If you are from a non-English speaking background, the required standard of English for this degree is one of the following English proficiency test scores:\nIf you need to undertake an English language test, you must meet one of the scores* below:\nWhen assessing applications, the Selection Committee will consider your previous studies and academic performance.\nThe Selection Committee may request additional information to clarify any aspect of an application, according to the University’s Academic Board rules regarding selection instruments.\nQuotas may be applied to the degree as a whole or to an individual stream, and preference may be given to applicants with evidence of appropriate preparation or potential to undertake research.\nEntry into the Master of Science (Mathematics and Statistics) is subject to the capacity of the relevant school to provide adequate supervision in the research project.\nYou do not need to contact a supervisor prior to applying.\nThe Weighted Average Mark (WAM) for this course is calculated using the Best 50 points of the most relevant subjects completed at the third-year level or in the final two years of study.\nFor applicants with diverse higher education backgrounds, different comprehensive and appropriate evaluation methods may be used for the Best 50 calculation, as determined by the Selection Committee.\nWe encourage domestic students to explore eligibility for Graduate Access Melbourne (GAM). GAM offers an opportunity for admission to this course even if your tertiary marks are below the standard entry requirements. GAM applicants may also be considered for financial bursaries and Commonwealth Supported Places (CSPs) where available.\nGAM categories include coming from a rural area, being an Indigenous Australian, experiencing financial hardship or personal difficulties, having refugee status, or living with a disability or medical condition. In assessing applications, we look to balance opportunity and your capacity to succeed.\nPrior studies may be credited towards your degree and potentially reduce the duration of your course. This is known as Advanced Standing (also known as credit or recognition of prior learning).\nContact-support \n    How can we help?\n• Arrow-right  \n          #1\n         \n          university in Australia\n• Course code:\n         MC-SCIMAT\n• English language test score requirements\n              Chevron-down\n• If you need to undertake an English language test, you must meet one of the scores* below:\n               \n    IELTS\n   \n    6.5\n   \n  with no band less than 6.0\n    TOEFL\n   \n    79+\n   \n  with writing 21; speaking 18; reading 13; listening 13\n    PEARSON\n   \n    64+\n   \n  with no communicative skill below 60\n    CAMBRIDGE\n   \n    176+\n   \n  with no skill less than 169 \n                *Accepted tests: IELTS (Academic English Only); TOEFL Internet-based test; Pearson Test of English Academic; Cambridge English: Advanced/Certificate of Advanced English (CAE).
