These courses have aimed to offer a thorough professional training which prepare students to embark on statistical careers in a variety of areas.\nThere is a shortage of statisticians trained to postgraduate level in the UK, meaning that you will be a highly desired candidate upon completion of this MSc. They have also provided a very good foundation for further study at PhD level.\nFor  entry in the academic year beginning September 2025, the tuition fees are as follows:\nFurther information for EU students can be found on our dedicated EU page.\nThe fees quoted above will be fully inclusive for the course tuition, administration and computational costs during your studies.\nAll fees for entry will be subject to yearly review and incremental rises per annum are also likely over the duration of courses lasting more than a year for UK/EU students (fees are typically fixed for International students, for the course duration at the year of entry). For general fees information please visit:         postgraduate fees\n. Always contact the department if you are unsure which fee applies to your qualification award and method of attendance.\nSelf-funded international applicants for this course will be required to pay a deposit of £1000 towards their tuition fees before a confirmation of acceptance for studies (CAS) is issued. This deposit will only be refunded if immigration permission is refused. We will notify you about how and when to make this payment.\nAll students should normally be able to complete their programme of study without incurring additional study costs over and above the tuition fee for that programme. Any unavoidable additional compulsory costs totalling more than 1% of the annual home undergraduate fee per annum, regardless of whether the programme in question is undergraduate or postgraduate taught, will be made clear to you at the point of application. Further information can be found in the University's Policy on additional costs incurred by students on undergraduate and postgraduate taught programmes (PDF document, 91KB).\nAcross our institution, we offer a number of postgraduate taught scholarships and awards to outstanding UK and international students each year. We are one of the Martingale Foundation's newest university partners. The Martingale Foundation helps provide access to postgraduate mathematics study for UK students facing financial barriers by offering fully-funded MSc and PhD programmes. Information about eligibility is available via the         Martingale Foundation website\n and applications will open on 13 August 2025. The deadine to apply is Sunday 19 October 2025.

These courses have aimed to offer a thorough professional training which prepare students to embark on statistical careers in a variety of areas.\nThere is a shortage of statisticians trained to postgraduate level in the UK, meaning that you will be a highly desired candidate upon completion of this MSc. They have also provided a very good foundation for further study at PhD level.\nThere are two teaching semesters of 12 weeks each and approximately 15 weeks of dissertation work. Assessment for the taught part is by exams and coursework. Following the successful completion of the taught part (worth a total of 120 credits) students are then expected to work on a dissertation from June to September which is worth a further 60 credits, making 180 credits in total. Information on the various topics and projects which will be available for dissertation are provided to the students in May from which they are invited to state their preferences.\nThe taught part of the programme is divided into two 12-week semesters, each followed by a two- or three-week period of examinations.  This in turn is followed by a period of approximately 12 weeks of research work over the summer which is supervised by a member of academic staff and ends with submission of the MSc dissertation in September. Full-time students attend weekly lectures and support classes for four modules (4 x 15 credits) in each semester.  Students can also enrol on a part-time basis.  In this case they study over a two year period and only take two modules per semester, with the dissertation being completed at the end of the second year. Details of the programme structure are given below, which are subject to review and continual improvement.\nMain Programme\nSemester One:\nSemester Two:\nThis degree programme is accredited by the Royal Statistical Society.\nAccreditation by the Royal Statistical Society (RSS) provides reassurance that our MSc programme produces graduates with the technical skills and subject knowledge required of a statistician.
