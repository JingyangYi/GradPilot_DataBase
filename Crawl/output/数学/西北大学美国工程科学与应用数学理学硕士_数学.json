Our faculty and students connect with engineers and scientists across departments, schools, and institutions, applying mathematics to challenging problems presented by the world around us in engineering and the physical, biological, and social sciences. In these applications we develop new mathematical methods that anticipate future challenges.\nOur master’s program offers advanced courses in applied mathematics that prepare students for a career as a professional mathematician in, for example, industrial environments where specialized PhD training is not required.\nWe seek applicants with an undergraduate degree in mathematics, the physical sciences, or engineering. Prospective students should have completed coursework in linear algebra, advanced calculus, and differential equations.\nRequest InfoLearn How to Apply\nThe basics at-a-glance\nThe full-time program’s coursework focuses on both analytical and computational methods in applied mathematics. Its computational sequence of courses will give students the necessary training to move into positions in industry requiring advanced knowledge of computational methods for partial differential methods, stochastic differential equations, and modern methods in parallel computing.\nStudents typically complete the program in one academic year.\nStudents complete 12 courses comprised of core courses and electives in numerical methods, asymptotic methods, analysis methods, and modeling. Special topics are also offered each year.\nStudents choosing the thesis option may replace two courses with research credit earned by completing a thesis project.\nView MS Student Handbook\nFor applied mathematicians, mathematical problems and solutions do not remain abstract, but connect with the real world providing understanding and rigorous answers to pressing questions. Often in collaboration with engineers and scientists, faculty and students develop mathematical models and methods to analyze, validate, and predict new phenomena.\n“Our department is very applied — everyone is working on specific science questions, tackling them from a more rigorous mathematical perspective than others in the field.”\nLearn more about Daniel Lecoanet\nOur unique environment provides academic, career, and social benefits\nOur position within the engineering school is unique among applied math departments and drives connections across disciplines. We collaborate with most other engineering departments as well as Northwestern’s Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences and the Feinberg School of Medicine. Students and faculty work directly with engineers and scientists to tackle real-world applications at the cutting edge of science and engineering.\nOur curriculum retains classical mathematical approaches while incorporating data-driven and computational techniques. In this way, we are training scientists to solve the biggest problems in the mathematics of life, physical, and social science.\nWe are located along the shores of Lake Michigan, only 17 miles from downtown Chicago. Our students benefit from a spectrum of suburban or urban home environments; extensive internship opportunities, cultural and entertainment experiences; and a diverse population. Beyond the classroom, students have opportunities to connect through our many student organizations.\nNorthwestern Engineering’s Department of Engineering Sciences and Applied Mathematics is using its uncommon position within an engineering school to seek out applied math applications in the real world, driving connections with interdisciplinary departments and groups at the University and beyond.\nCentral to the department's research is the development of data-driven and principle-based mathematical models to harness the vast and complex data available to us today.\nWhere do we go from here?\nWhile they are at Northwestern, our students benefit from professional development opportunities that prepare them for the next step in their careers. They serve as teaching assistants, present research results at national and international conferences where they can build a global network of contacts. And they have access to internships and extensive career placement resources via both Northwestern Engineering Career Development and Northwestern Career Advancement.\nMeet Our Alumni\nWhere our alumni work in industry\nRequest a customized program guide about the master of science in engineering sciences and applied mathematics.\nRequest Your Program Guide\n• Curriculum & Requirements\n• Admissions\n• Engineering Home\n• ESAM Department\n• Academics\n• Graduate Study\n• Master's Degree\n[CARD]\nWithout a thesisStudents complete 12 courses comprised of core courses and electives in numerical methods, asymptotic methods, analysis methods, and modeling.

Applications are due by December 31 for admission for the following Fall quarter. The application and all materials (including letters of recommendation, transcripts, scores, etc.) must be submitted by this date to be given full consideration.\nSuccessful applicants typically have good grades in relevant mathematics courses, and strong letters of recommendation.\nRelevant courses that we look for are:\nNot all students admitted will have all these courses on their transcript. Sometimes the content is delivered in a course that is not officially listed as a mathematics course, neither of which will preclude an offer of admission. Undergraduate research experience in the topics above is certainly a plus, but not required.\nAlmost all students admitted to the PhD program are provided with financial assistance that covers the cost of tuition, books, and living expenses. For first-year students, most often the assistance is offered in the form of a fellowship grant that has no additional required duties. Thereafter, support is provided in the form of a combination of research and teaching assistantships.\nJump to a Section\nWe consider prior academic performance, research and other professional experience, and overall potential to successfully pursue graduate study in our department.\nSpecific courses we look for on previous transcripts are advanced calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, complex variables, numerical methods, and mathematical modeling. The first three courses are essential, while the others are preferred for successful applicants.\nForeign students from non-English speaking countries must also take the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) exam.\nApplication forms and materials must be submitted online by 11:59 p.m., December 31st for admission the following Fall. Late January through March: General timeline for most offers of admission to be made. February-April: Group visits of accepted students to Northwestern. April 15: Deadline for students to accept offers of admission.\nYou must apply electronically. There is no paper application. Complete the online application. Letters of recommendation and transcripts from all schools attended after you complete high school must be submitted online.\nWe cannot waive the application fee. The Graduate School offers a small number of fee waivers to qualified applicants. For more information, see The Graduate School website.\nA financial statement is not necessary for the application process, but in some cases in may be requested before enrollment.\nThe department does not require a writing sample separate from the Statement of Purpose. Submission of a resume or CV is optional.\nAll applications are evaluated the same way, as long as they reach us before the deadline. Applications after the deadline may be considered, but late applications will most likely not be considered for financial assistance.\nReturn to The Graduate School's Online Application website. Click on the search button in the User Login section. Still having problems? Contact The Graduate School.\nNo. With very few exceptions, we only admit students in the fall quarter due to the dependencies of courses during the year.\nIn this situation you should indicate your preference for the PhD program. The MS program refers to students who are interested only in that degree. An MS degree is not required for admission to the PhD program, and students who successfully complete the first year PhD program are awarded an MS degree upon request.\nWe strongly encourage students to finish their degrees from the department in which they originally enrolled. We generally do not accept students from other PhD programs.\nNot before you have been accepted. All decisions on admission and financial support are made by a committee, and a faculty member does not influence this process unless he or she writes a letter of recommendation. Those applicants who have been admitted are encouraged to email or telephone individual faculty members for information on research, etc.\nReturn to Top\nNorthwestern University's school code for TOEFL is 1565.

We anticipate that, starting with the academic year 2025-2026, the number of required courses will be reduced and students will do 2 quarters of Research Experience with 2 different faculty members during their first year. We will give details about the new requirements on this page once the changes have been finalized.\nThe PhD program in applied mathematics at Northwestern includes a combination of coursework, research, and professional development. The coursework is a combination of core applied mathematics topics with special topics courses that are chosen to support your research and personal interests. The core courses include differential equations, mathematical modeling, asymptotic analysis, and numerical methods.\nTypically graduate students are not involved in research during their first year, completing only coursework. There are four preliminary exams (given in the first year in the beginning of January) that are based on foundation concepts necessary for more advanced coursework and research.\nAt the end of the first year of coursework, students choose research advisers and begin research that will lead to their PhD dissertation. Research groups vary in size from a single faculty member and student, to groups involving combinations of multiple faculty, postdocs, and graduate and undergraduate students. Often research is conducted in collaboration with faculty in an applied field outside the department.\nAlmost all students serve as teaching assistants during their second year of studies. Serving as a teaching assistant gives students the opportunity to develop their teaching and mentoring skills. During the second and part of the third year, students continue taking courses along with their research. Students also take the Qualifying Examination by the end of their second year. After that, they concentrate mainly on research.\nThe average time for completion of the PhD program is about five years.\nJump to a Section\nThe following requirements are in addition to, or further elaborate upon, those requirements outlined in the Northwestern University Graduate School policies. These requirements can generally lead to a master's degree after three quarters of study.\nStudents admitted to the PhD program will satisfy these requirements upon completion of the first year PhD degree program (see below). Additional information is available in the ESAM department's PhD student handbook.\nTo see a list of coursework requirements for the PhD in engineering sciences and applied mathematics, please see the department’s PhD student handbook.\nPhD student handbook\nReturn to Top\nES APPM 420-1 ES APPM 411-1 ES APPM 446-1 ES APPM 421-1\nES APPM 411-23 Elective courses\n4 Elective courses\nThe Responsible Conduct of Research training is also required in the first year.\nReturn to Top\nResponsible Conduct of Research (RCR) training is required by The Graduate School of all first year graduate students and consists of two parts: First is the GEN_ENG 519 course, which must be completed by the end of the Spring Quarter of the first year of study. Please see the PhD student handbook for more details.\nSecond is a CITI online course that should be completed by December 1 of the first year of study. Learn more about setting up a CITI account.\nReturn to Top\nDuring the first year of study, a passing grade in the written preliminary examinations in differential equations, advanced calculus, complex variables and linear algebra is required. The examinations are given at the advanced undergraduate-beginning graduate level. The preliminary exams are scheduled for the beginning of winter quarter. One retest is possible and will be scheduled for the beginning of spring quarter.\nReturn to Top\nAn oral qualifying examination is required for admission to candidacy. The qualifying examination is normally taken at the end of the second year of the program. This oral examination is administered by a faculty committee, including the student's research adviser.\nThe precise nature of the examination is decided by the student's approved thesis committee. The content of the exam is determined by the research advisor(s) and can include a brief presentation of the proposed thesis research project in addition to questions drawn from course material relevant to the project. The student must identify, in consultation with the research advisor(s), at least three graduate level ESAM courses that are most relevant to the proposed project. The list of courses must be approved by the committee prior to the examination and the student will be expected to answer questions based on those courses.\nUpon passing the qualifying examination, the student is admitted to PhD candidacy. A student must be admitted to candidacy prior to the beginning of the student's third year. If the student does not pass the examination, the faculty committee will determine if and when a retake is warranted.\nReturn to Top\nOriginal research, defended before the student's doctoral committee.\nReturn to Top\nThe final examination is on the student's completed doctoral research, presented in lecture style to a faculty committee including the research adviser. Copies of the doctoral dissertation should be given to each member of the examination committee at least two weeks prior to the presentation. Upon passing the final examination, the committee will recommend to the university that the PhD degree be awarded.\nReturn to Top\nSatisfactory progress in the program is determined by department review of examination results, course grades, and faculty recommendations.\nReturn to Top\nStudents entering with a BS degree must take at least 18 courses. There are 5 core, required courses, and students may choose their remaining 13 elective courses. Most students take 12 courses, 4 per quarter, during the first year, and 6 courses in the second year. After successful completion of the first year of study, students may receive an MS degree.\nReturn to Top\nStudents entering with an MS degree must take at least 18 courses. Some of the core course requirements may be waived if equivalent courses were taken when earning the MS degree.

They were all eager to teach me everything and really embraced me as part of the team. It was amazing how quickly they brought me up to speed and taught me how everything worked. It felt like I was truly a member of the team.”\n“\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIt [co-op] exposed me to two different sides of my major and narrowed down what I want to do in my future career. I was able to experience both the research side of my major, biomedical engineering, and also the research and development for medical devices. I got to see two different doors. Essentially, that helped me narrow down what I want to do in the future.”\n“\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI built a lot of connections in the industry. It’s a lot easier to do that once you’re inside than from the outside. Having almost a year of experience comes in handy. You really build more meaningful connections in a co-op experience because they are really invested in watching you grow.”\n“\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBeing in a data analyst co-op helped me see what the role actually means and how to be responsible. I think that part is really important. Also, I connected with very amazing coworkers and supervisors.”\n“\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCo-ops presented a really interesting option as I started to look at internships, because you stay at a company longer. The projects you work on are bigger in scope and can last for months, rather than just 10 weeks.”\n“\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tParticipating in co-ops has helped me understand the meaning of my courses a lot better. It helped me see why what I was learning in school was important.”\nWe augment the analytical core of engineering with design, entrepreneurship, leadership, personal development, and unusual collaborations to imagine what's next and take the world in a whole new direction.Learn More\n• TueSep 23Grad Career Lab: Resume Strategies\n• WedSep 24Grad Career Lab: Resume Strategies\n• FriSep 26Northwestern 2025 Tech Career Fair\n• TueSep 30Grad Career Lab: Career Fair + Networking\n[CARD]\nCooperative Engineering Education Program (Co-op)Co-op is an educational program which allows engineering students to alternate periods of academic study with full-time periods of paid work experience related to their academic and professional goals.Explore Co-ops\n[CARD]\nInternshipsInternships offered by the Office of Career Development offer students opportunities to gain practical work experience with employers in industry, commerce, or government.Explore Internships\n[CARD]\nResearch ExperienceStudents who are interested in career paths in research and academia have the opportunity to engage in a formal engineering research experience, either at a university (including Northwestern University) or a government laboratory.Explore Research\n[CARD]\nService LearningThe Projects in Service Learning program offers students have the opportunity to volunteer their time and engineering skills for non-profit organizations.Explore Service Learning\n[CARD]\nConnect with McCormick career advisors, events, and resources\nUse McCormickConnect to view and sign up for ECD events and interviews, schedule appointments with your ECD career advisor, view job listings, and report co-op or internship positions for work-integrated learning.Explore McCormickConnect\n[CARD]\nLook for work and register for Northwestern career events\nHandshake is the central career services platform managed by Northwestern Career Advancement.
