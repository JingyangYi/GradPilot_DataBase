Key skills include data management, statistical reasoning, the interpretation of numeric data for scientific inference, and the ability to collaborate and communicate effectively with scientists and other public health stakeholders across disciplines. Thematic areas of study include clinical trials, machine learning, and data science.\nThe Master of Science in Biostatistics program will train students in biostatistical methods for study design, data analysis, and statistical reporting for scientific and lay audiences. This degree will train students in key areas including data management, statistical reasoning, the interpretation of numeric data for scientific inference in studies in medicine and public health, and the ability to collaborate and communicate effectively with scientists and other public health stakeholders across disciplines. Graduates of the program are prepared to work as statisticians in a variety of professional environments including government, academic, healthcare, and industry. In addition, students receive training in preparation for quantitative doctoral programs  in public health, such as biostatistics and epidemiology.\nStudents will have the opportunity to work with faculty on many public health problems. Examples include:\nStudents are engaged in several active learning opportunities outside of their courses:\nThe Biostatistics faculty at NYU GPH has expertise in a broad range of biostatistical methods and substantive areas of study. Faculty have methodological expertise in survival analysis, clinical trials, statistical inference, mixed-methods community-engaged research, survey research, machine learning, methods for analysis of social media and mobile health data, intensive longitudinal designs and analysis, biomarkers, latent variables, mediation analysis and causal inference. In addition, faculty have field-proven expertise in health disparities, community-based research, stakeholder engaged research, Alzheimer’s disease, minority stress, substance use, tobacco research.\nRequired courses (18 credits):\nGPH-GU 2106 Epidemiology (3)  [F, S]GPH-GU 2995 Biostatistics for Public Health (3) [F, S, Su]GPH-GU 5170 Introduction to Public Health  (0) [F, S]GPH-GU 2353 Regression I: Linear Regression and Modeling (3) [F, S]GPH-GU 2354 Regression II: Categorical Data Analysis (3) [F]GPH-GU 2361 Research Methods in Public Health (3) [F, S]GPH-GU 2450 Intermediate Epidemiology (3) [S]\nAll MS Biostatistics students take 12 credits of selective courses:For all selective courses below, when you take one as a requirement, the other may be taken as an elective.\nChoose one of the following (3 credits)GPH-GU 2286 Introduction to Data Management and Statistical Computing (3)* [F]GPH-GU 2182 Statistical Programming in R (3) [F]\nChoose one of the following (3 credits):GPH-GU 2225 Psychometric Measurement & Analysis in Public Health Research & Practice (3) [F, Su]GPH-GU 2387 Survey Design, Analysis, and Reporting (3) [F]\nChoose one of the following (3 credits):GPH-GU 2480 Longitudinal Analysis of Public Health Data (3) [S]GPH-GU 2368 Applied Survival Analysis (3) [S]\nChoose one of the following (3 credits):GPH-GU 2930 Epidemiology Design & Methods (3) [F]GPH-GU 3225 Statistical Inference (3) [F]GPH-GU 2363 Causal Inference: Design and Analysis (3) [F]APSTA-GE-2012 Causal Inference (3) [F]\nElectives (12 credits):\n9 credits are required to have statistical content.
