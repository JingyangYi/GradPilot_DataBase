So he sought out an actuarial internship the summer before his senior year and began applying to graduate programs as he neared graduation.\nIn an interview with SPS, Dennis shared what ultimately attracted him to Columbia’s M.S. in Actuarial Science program, where he currently serves as Actuarial Society of Columbia University president, and what excites him about the field.\nHow did you hear about Columbia’s M.S. in Actuarial Science program? What attracted you to the program?\nI heard about the program when I was researching good Actuarial Science graduate programs. Not all actuaries go to graduate school. Actually, it’s one of the perks of the profession. However, a graduate school—especially one with a reputable brand name attached to it—can attract more potential employers. In researching top actuarial programs, Columbia came up, and I decided to apply. I applied for two reasons: To get Columbia University on my resume and to get a wider range of companies interested in me.\nWhat’s special or unique about Columbia’s Actuarial Science M.S. program? What value does a master’s in Actuarial Science from Columbia bring?\nFirst, Columbia is the only Ivy League university with a graduate degree in Actuarial Science. Thus, in getting this degree, you obtain specific, career-oriented math education (especially if your undergraduate degree was not actuarial science) and you get a huge resume boost. Before Columbia, I was receiving many rejections from big-name companies in the insurance industry and related industries. Once I entered the program, the internship search became significantly easier, and I even had the problem of too many offers to choose from for an internship.\nHow would you describe the work you do in actuarial science, and what excites you about the field?\nTo summarize the day-to-day work: data, data, data. Your life will revolve around looking at data, updating data to be more current, building and validating statistical models, and communicating to actuaries and non-actuaries the insights you gained. This excites me because I can leverage my knowledge of statistics, coding, machine learning algorithms, and ability to communicate clearly to be the best actuary I can be. And unlike many other math-heavy professions, the hours aren't as grueling—many days you will work a typical 9-to-5 with some busy periods during ratemaking season.\nCan you tell us a bit about the (notoriously difficult) actuarial science exams?\nTo become a fully credentialed actuary, you need to pass a series of exams, administered either by the Society of Actuaries (for Life and Health) or Casualty Actuary Society (for P&C). The earlier exams in the pathway cover probability, statistics, statistical modeling, and spreadsheet work, while the later exams cover more specific topics within the insurance industry and risk management, including the regulatory and legal side of things.\nTo give an idea about how difficult the exams are, pass rates for these exams range from 40 to 60%. A ChatGPT model was trained to try and take one of these exams, and it could not pass. (For reference, ChatGPT can be trained to pass the bar exam to become a lawyer!) This may sound difficult, but you are generously rewarded with a pay raise at your company for each exam you pass, and once you become fully credentialed, you have a salary above $200,000 and incredible job security due to the rarity of your credentials.\nI would like to note that of the Columbia students who sat for Probability Exam P, the first actuarial exam this semester, 80% passed! This highlights how complementary the core curriculum of the program is to exam progress.\nAlong with your role as Actuarial Society of Columbia University president, are you involved with any other extracurricular clubs or activities at Columbia?\nI’m currently in the Columbia Swing Dance Club and taking classes with the Columbia Bartending Agency. Swing dancing is just something I do for fun once a week at our practices. As for the Columbia Bartending Agency, I’m learning the basic tips and techniques to bartend so that I can pass the exam at the end and work as an independent bartender for the agency, getting hired to do gigs all around New York City!\nBolstered by research and faculty from Columbia University's department of statistics and Columbia Engineering School, the M.S. in Actuarial Science program equips students with the tools, skills, and knowledge to excel in today’s rapidly evolving actuarial and related workplaces. Graduates are sought after by insurance, investment and banking, and media and technology companies, among others.\nThe 36-credit program is ranked No. 1 for the best master's program in Actuarial Science in the United States and is the recipient of the Society of Actuaries Presidential Award, and is available full-time and part-time in person, with select courses available online.\nConsidering the value and applications of computer programming skills in sustainability science.\nFrom theory-rich coursework to real-world conflict mapping, Negotiation and Conflict Resolution student Eugenia Pozas reflects on what she learned during her immersive in-person experience in New York.\nHBCU Fellow Tre’von Conner shares how the IKNS curriculum at Columbia is helping him learn how to effectively tackle organizational challenges.\n• Actuarial Science\n[CARD]\nSaving the Planet, One Matplotlib Call at a Time\n\nConsidering the value and applications of computer programming skills in sustainability science.\nRelated News\nAll News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudent\n\nSaving the Planet, One Matplotlib Call at a Time\n\nConsidering the value and applications of computer programming skills in sustainability science.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudent\n\nWhat I Learned at Columbia’s NECR Summer Residency\n\nFrom theory-rich coursework to real-world conflict mapping, Negotiation and Conflict Resolution student Eugenia Pozas reflects on what she learned during her immersive in-person experience in New York.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudent\n\nPushing Personal Boundaries to Gain Bigger Breakthroughs\n\nHBCU Fellow Tre’von Conner shares how the IKNS curriculum at Columbia is helping him learn how to effectively tackle organizational challenges.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll News\n[CARD]\nSaving the Planet, One Matplotlib Call at a Time\n\nConsidering the value and applications of computer programming skills in sustainability science.\nRelated News\nAll News\n[CARD]\nRelated News\nAll News\n[CARD]\nSaving the Planet, One Matplotlib Call at a Time\n\nConsidering the value and applications of computer programming skills in sustainability science.\nStudent\n\nSaving the Planet, One Matplotlib Call at a Time\n\nConsidering the value and applications of computer programming skills in sustainability science.\n[CARD]\nStudent\n[CARD]\nSaving the Planet, One Matplotlib Call at a Time\n\nConsidering the value and applications of computer programming skills in sustainability science.\n[CARD]\nConsidering the value and applications of computer programming skills in sustainability science.\n[CARD]\nWhat I Learned at Columbia’s NECR Summer Residency\n\nFrom theory-rich coursework to real-world conflict mapping, Negotiation and Conflict Resolution student Eugenia Pozas reflects on what she learned during her immersive in-person experience in New York.\nStudent\n\nWhat I Learned at Columbia’s NECR Summer Residency\n\nFrom theory-rich coursework to real-world conflict mapping, Negotiation and Conflict Resolution student Eugenia Pozas reflects on what she learned during her immersive in-person experience in New York.\n[CARD]\nStudent\n[CARD]\nWhat I Learned at Columbia’s NECR Summer Residency\n\nFrom theory-rich coursework to real-world conflict mapping, Negotiation and Conflict Resolution student Eugenia Pozas reflects on what she learned during her immersive in-person experience in New York.\n[CARD]\nFrom theory-rich coursework to real-world conflict mapping, Negotiation and Conflict Resolution student Eugenia Pozas reflects on what she learned during her immersive in-person experience in New York.\n[CARD]\nPushing Personal Boundaries to Gain Bigger Breakthroughs\n\nHBCU Fellow Tre’von Conner shares how the IKNS curriculum at Columbia is helping him learn how to effectively tackle organizational challenges.\nStudent\n\nPushing Personal Boundaries to Gain Bigger Breakthroughs\n\nHBCU Fellow Tre’von Conner shares how the IKNS curriculum at Columbia is helping him learn how to effectively tackle organizational challenges.\n[CARD]\nStudent\n[CARD]\nPushing Personal Boundaries to Gain Bigger Breakthroughs\n\nHBCU Fellow Tre’von Conner shares how the IKNS curriculum at Columbia is helping him learn how to effectively tackle organizational challenges.\n[CARD]\nHBCU Fellow Tre’von Conner shares how the IKNS curriculum at Columbia is helping him learn how to effectively tackle organizational challenges.",

He shared tools and insights that he acquired as an SPS student, the surprising link he learned between actuarial science and storytelling, and how his final project at the program became a major talking point in job interviews.\nTell us a little bit about your current role and how your time at SPS has informed your work.I’m currently working as a senior data analyst with a healthcare insurer. The analytical mindset and problem-solving skills I picked up as a student in the Actuarial Science program have proved to be critical to my day-to-day work. Several of the classes included projects that involved model building in Excel to apply theories learned in class. Projects like these gave me hands-on experience and, more importantly, a developed approach to similar problems at work.Is there anything about actuarial science that might surprise someone new to the field?\nActuarial science is more than just understanding how to calculate insurance premiums. It’s a fascinating field that involves diverse applications of math, statistics, finance, and risk management in various fields like pensions, investments, government, and health care to help entities manage financial risks.\nHaving a rigorous mathematical background is necessary, as the majority of the work relies on complicated analytical models, but being successful in the actuarial science field is not just about number crunching. While accurate results are the basis for analysis, having excellent communication skills is indispensable, as one must be able to convey complex financial concepts and model outputs to non-experts. As my current director once told me: From the model outputs, you must always have a story to tell that ends with a punchline.\nWhat has been your biggest takeaway from the program? Was there a class you loved or skills you gained that you have found particularly useful?\nColumbia’s Actuarial Science program not only prepared me for my exams, but also equipped me as a practical problem solver with a rigorous analytical mind.\nIn addition to the core classes, I found that many of my favorite classes were electives. In the Risk Management in P&C (Property and Casualty) class, we had two professors who were industry leaders in the P&C field. The class not only equipped us with the corresponding industry knowledge but also presented us with actual cases to work through. And the ProSeminar provided me a platform to meet industry leaders and experts in my areas of interest, and gave me countless opportunities to engage with them both during and after seminars to help develop my career network.\nWere you involved in a project during your time in the Actuarial Science program that you found particularly meaningful?\nColumbia’s brand, New York City’s location, and the program’s rigorous academic requirements all made for a memorable experience, but the integrated project I worked on during summer break really stands out. I had the opportunity to work with Society of Actuaries fellow Rebecca Owen and fellow student Joy Gao on a healthcare issue related to opioid overdoses. The project used publicly available data to examine opioid prescribing patterns and create models to find opioid prescribing outliers.\nDuring the 10-week project, we learned how to apply the analytical skills we had acquired in the program on actual data, build a model using reasonable assumptions, and come up with observations and recommendations. The project ended up being published as a research paper and became one of the highlights and talking points in my job search after graduation.\nViews and opinions expressed here are those of the authors, and do not necessarily reflect the official position of Columbia University.\nAbout the Program\nThe Master of Science in Actuarial Science program at Columbia University is internationally renowned for its breakthrough curriculum and esteemed faculty.

She introduced us to the Proseminar, a required course that invites industry professionals to give talks about their companies and provide glimpses into their careers. Lina also provided us with a list of career events for the upcoming semester, encouraging us to attend fairs such as the ASNY Virtual Career Fair, Gamma Iota Sigma Annual Conference, and the Columbia Actuarial Science Career Fair, which she emphasized was the most crucial to attend among all the events.\nAs a Columbia-hosted event specifically tailored for its students, the Career Fair was the one I anticipated the most. I went well prepared, practicing potential answers in the mirror, printing more than 30 resumes with the finest paper, and dressing up in my best suit.\nAfter my Actuarial Models class, I hurried from Lewisohn Hall to Casa Italiana on the opposite side of campus. After climbing the marble staircase to the second floor, I was overwhelmed with choices. There were more than twenty companies spanning all sectors of the industry, all eager to connect. Which one should I head to first?\nStudents at the 2024 Actuarial Science Career Fair at Casa Italiana.\nI decided to warm up at New York Life, a familiar name among Actuarial Science students. There, I reconnected with Ilya Gorshteyn and Alex Zaslavskiy, whom I had previously spoken to during our Proseminar and the ASNY Career Fair. I was glad they recognized me, as we were able to continue our conversation from our previous interactions and I was able to gain more insights about the company’s operations and summer internship program.\nI then went to reintroduce myself to other past Proseminar companies such as Marsh, Global Atlantic, and Arch. It seemed as if it was a reunion event since, similar to my interaction with New York Life, I was able to pick up conversations where we had left off and delve deeper, reinforcing my candidacy. I also explored new companies that were in attendance. Some of them I was not as familiar with but quickly learned about as their representatives enthusiastically shared insights.\nA representative from Global Atlantic Financial Group greets students at the Actuarial Science Career Fair.\nWhat distinguished this career fair from countless others I have attended was that it was exclusively targeted to Columbia Actuarial Science and adjacent program students. The ratio between companies and attendees was much lower, which meant that recruiters were able to engage more attentively with each student. I felt more natural speaking with the recruiters as there was no need to rush the conversation, which has typically been my experience with larger fairs.\nAs my friends and I exited Casa Italiana, we left not only with company swag filling up our bags, but also a sense of confidence and motivation, a clarity about our career paths, and an excitement for the professional journey ahead. I could not have felt any more empowered having had the chance to connect on a deeper level with professionals who truly valued the actuarial skills I was developing. The fair reinforced my commitment to this field with new insights, stronger professional connections, and a greater sense of purpose.\nAbout the Program\nBolstered by research and faculty from Columbia University's department of statistics and Columbia Engineering School, the M.S. in Actuarial Science program equips students with the tools, skills, and knowledge to excel in today’s rapidly evolving actuarial and related workplaces. Graduates are sought after by insurance, investment and banking, and media and technology companies, among others.\nThe 36-credit program is ranked No. 1 for the best master's program in Actuarial Science in the United States and is the recipient of the Society of Actuaries Presidential Award, and is available full-time and part-time in person, with select courses available online.\nConsidering the value and applications of computer programming skills in sustainability science.\nFrom theory-rich coursework to real-world conflict mapping, Negotiation and Conflict Resolution student Eugenia Pozas reflects on what she learned during her immersive in-person experience in New York.\nHBCU Fellow Tre’von Conner shares how the IKNS curriculum at Columbia is helping him learn how to effectively tackle organizational challenges.\n• Actuarial Science\n[CARD]\nSaving the Planet, One Matplotlib Call at a Time\n\nConsidering the value and applications of computer programming skills in sustainability science.\nRelated News\nAll News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudent\n\nSaving the Planet, One Matplotlib Call at a Time\n\nConsidering the value and applications of computer programming skills in sustainability science.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudent\n\nWhat I Learned at Columbia’s NECR Summer Residency\n\nFrom theory-rich coursework to real-world conflict mapping, Negotiation and Conflict Resolution student Eugenia Pozas reflects on what she learned during her immersive in-person experience in New York.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudent\n\nPushing Personal Boundaries to Gain Bigger Breakthroughs\n\nHBCU Fellow Tre’von Conner shares how the IKNS curriculum at Columbia is helping him learn how to effectively tackle organizational challenges.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll News\n[CARD]\nSaving the Planet, One Matplotlib Call at a Time\n\nConsidering the value and applications of computer programming skills in sustainability science.\nRelated News\nAll News\n[CARD]\nRelated News\nAll News\n[CARD]\nSaving the Planet, One Matplotlib Call at a Time\n\nConsidering the value and applications of computer programming skills in sustainability science.\nStudent\n\nSaving the Planet, One Matplotlib Call at a Time\n\nConsidering the value and applications of computer programming skills in sustainability science.\n[CARD]\nStudent\n[CARD]\nSaving the Planet, One Matplotlib Call at a Time\n\nConsidering the value and applications of computer programming skills in sustainability science.\n[CARD]\nConsidering the value and applications of computer programming skills in sustainability science.\n[CARD]\nWhat I Learned at Columbia’s NECR Summer Residency\n\nFrom theory-rich coursework to real-world conflict mapping, Negotiation and Conflict Resolution student Eugenia Pozas reflects on what she learned during her immersive in-person experience in New York.\nStudent\n\nWhat I Learned at Columbia’s NECR Summer Residency\n\nFrom theory-rich coursework to real-world conflict mapping, Negotiation and Conflict Resolution student Eugenia Pozas reflects on what she learned during her immersive in-person experience in New York.\n[CARD]\nStudent\n[CARD]\nWhat I Learned at Columbia’s NECR Summer Residency\n\nFrom theory-rich coursework to real-world conflict mapping, Negotiation and Conflict Resolution student Eugenia Pozas reflects on what she learned during her immersive in-person experience in New York.\n[CARD]\nFrom theory-rich coursework to real-world conflict mapping, Negotiation and Conflict Resolution student Eugenia Pozas reflects on what she learned during her immersive in-person experience in New York.\n[CARD]\nPushing Personal Boundaries to Gain Bigger Breakthroughs\n\nHBCU Fellow Tre’von Conner shares how the IKNS curriculum at Columbia is helping him learn how to effectively tackle organizational challenges.\nStudent\n\nPushing Personal Boundaries to Gain Bigger Breakthroughs\n\nHBCU Fellow Tre’von Conner shares how the IKNS curriculum at Columbia is helping him learn how to effectively tackle organizational challenges.\n[CARD]\nStudent\n[CARD]\nPushing Personal Boundaries to Gain Bigger Breakthroughs\n\nHBCU Fellow Tre’von Conner shares how the IKNS curriculum at Columbia is helping him learn how to effectively tackle organizational challenges.\n[CARD]\nHBCU Fellow Tre’von Conner shares how the IKNS curriculum at Columbia is helping him learn how to effectively tackle organizational challenges.",

For Stewart, the Actuarial Science program at SPS opened the door to his current position and allowed him to cultivate a robust network of friends and connections. He now gives back to Columbia SPS by sharing his knowledge and expertise with future professionals as a teacher associate for the Actuarial Science and Applied Analytics programs.\nIn a recent interview, Stewart discussed his work since graduating from the program and the lessons he’d like to share with current and future students.\nCan you provide some background about your decision to join the Actuarial Science program? Was there anything unique to the field of actuarial science that enticed you to it over another field within applied math?\nMy decision to join the Actuarial Science program stemmed from a desire to pivot from the abstract world of theoretical mathematics to something more tangible and impactful. Having earned a master’s in theoretical math from McNeese State University, I found myself craving a field where I could see the real-world applications of my skills. I began exploring applied mathematics by taking programming and statistical courses, which naturally led me to actuarial science—a field that uniquely blends math, statistics, and business problem-solving. What set it apart from other applied math disciplines, like data science or operations research, was its focus on risk management and its direct connection to decision-making in industries like insurance and finance. That practical relevance intrigued me.\nWhen I enrolled in my first actuarial course, I was hooked—not just by the subject matter, but by the passionate students and the approachable director who made the program feel like a tight-knit community. The curriculum’s balance of technical rigor and real-world utility sealed the deal for me. It was the perfect bridge between my mathematical roots and my growing interest in applied problem-solving.\nWhat was your favorite thing about the program as a student?\nMy favorite aspect was the sense of community it fostered, which stood in stark contrast to my previous academic experiences. The professors were experts in their field and genuinely approachable—always willing to chat about coursework, career advice, or even the latest industry trends. The student body was equally impressive: a diverse, collaborative group of people who were just as eager to learn from each other as from the lectures.\nWhat really made it special, though, was the smaller, more intimate class sizes. Unlike the larger, more impersonal master’s courses I’d taken before, these classes allowed for meaningful discussions, personalized feedback, and a level of connection that made every session feel engaging and tailored. It created an environment where I could thrive both academically and socially.\nCan you update us on your work since you finished the program? How did you arrive at your current position?\nSince graduating, I’ve carved out an exciting career path that blends my love for mathematics and technology. I currently work at Prudential, where I lead a team developing a group insurance rating platform—a role that sits at the intersection of actuarial science and IT. My team collaborates closely with both the actuarial department and the tech group, designing tools that streamline processes and enhance decision-making. It’s a dynamic hybrid position that keeps me on my toes and lets me leverage both my analytical skills and my programming experience.\nMy journey to this role began with a fortunate connection from the program: One of my professors, who also worked at a software company, FJA, specializing in actuarial solutions, brought me onto a project modernizing Prudential’s underwriting and actuarial platform. That gig was a game changer: I got hands-on experience, built relationships with key players at Prudential, and showcased my ability to bridge technical and actuarial needs. After a few years of proving myself externally, those connections paid off when Prudential recruited me to bring their modeling efforts in-house, tasking me with leading a team to boost efficiency and accelerate delivery timelines. It’s been a rewarding climb, and I’m proud to be shaping the future of their operations.\nHave any lessons or experiences from your time in the program remained particularly salient?\nOne lesson from the Actuarial Science program that has stuck with me—and truly shaped my career—is the immense value of networking. Since I came from a more theoretical master’s program at McNeese, where the focus was heavily academic and individualistic, the contrast at this program was striking. Here, I learned that building relationships isn’t just a nice-to-have; it’s a cornerstone of professional success, especially in a field like actuarial science that thrives on collaboration across industries. The program didn’t just teach me technical skills; it opened doors through alumni events, casual meetups with professors, and interactions with peers who were already plugged into the NYC job market. Looking back, I’d say there’s no better place in the city to cultivate those connections. That network became my launchpad, and it’s a lesson I carry with me every day: Your skills get you in the room, but your relationships keep you there and propel you forward.\nWhat advice would you like to share with potential students of the program?\nMy biggest piece of advice for potential students is simple but game-changing: Don’t skip the alumni events! They’re not just fun—they’re a goldmine for building your career. I’ve been to plenty, and every time, I walk away energized from catching up with former classmates, swapping stories with seasoned alumni, and hearing what the newest grads are up to in their jobs. These events are a low-pressure way to expand your network, pick up insider tips about the industry, and even stumble into opportunities you didn’t know existed. Beyond that, I’d say dive into the program with an open mind—say yes to every chance to connect, whether it’s a guest lecture, a study group, or a casual chat with a professor. You never know which conversation might spark your next big break.\nThe Master of Science in Actuarial Science program at Columbia University is internationally renowned for its breakthrough curriculum and esteemed faculty.

Request Information\nCourses typically meet one or two times a week. Many courses are also offered during the day, as well.\nIndividualized programs of study may be developed to accommodate those students who have completed some of the required coursework prior to entering the program as well as those students who wish to do additional coursework in risk management, data analysis, and mathematical finance.\nAdvanced students may take electives in mathematical finance, risk management, and advanced statistical methods.\nProbability is the foundation on which statistics is built. The purposes of this course are 1) to introduce you to probability and 2) prepare you to take a sequel course on statistical inference (Statistics 4204,5204).\nWe shall begin by covering the basic axioms of probability and using these in some simple settings. Then we will take up the idea of independence and conditional probability. Following we shall consider random variables, and the properties first of univariate discrete and continuous distributions. When we look at two or more variables, additional considerations arise, such as the relationship between the variables|conditional distributions and marginal distributions. Following these basics, we will then take up some ways of summarizing distributions, e.g., expectations and variances and, in summarizing relationships among variables, covariance and correlation. We then take up some of the more important distributions in statistics. In particular, for the discrete case, we will study the Bernoulli and binomial distributions and the generalization to the multinomial distribution, also the Poisson distribution. For continuous distributions, we take up the univariate and bivariate normal, the Gamma and the Beta distribution. In statistical applications, sums of independent random variables (for example, a sample average is such a sum, divided by sample size) are extremely important and characterizing the properties of these in large samples justifies many of the ways in which we make inferences in statistics. Thus, we take up the properties of these sums in large samples, focusing on stating laws of large numbers and also a simple central limit theorem.\nThe aim of the course is to describe the two aspects of statistics {estimation and inference {in some details. The topics will include maximum likelihood estimation, Bayesian inference, confidence intervals, bootstrap methods, some nonparametric tests, statistical hypothesis testing, linear regression models, ANOVA, etc.\nThis course explores actuarial models for life contingent risks, their theoretical basis and application.  It discusses survival models, life tables, life insurance and annuity benefits, premium and reserve calculations related to policies on a single life.\nThis course covers the material of the long term portion of the Fundamentals of Actuarial Mathematics (FAM) exam of the Society of Actuaries (SOA).  This is a core course of the Actuarial Science program. Students who have already passed the MLC exam, the LTAM exam or the FAM exam (or its long term portion) administered by the SOA are exempted from this class and can substitute an elective\nThis course is a continuation of Actuarial Methods I. It discusses Markov chains and their application to a wide variety of long term insurance products, fundamentals of pension liabilities, profit tests, universal life, and equity-linked insurance. This class, along with Actuarial Methods I, covers the material of Exam LTAM of the Society of Actuaries. Students who have already taken and passed the ALTAM exam or the LTAM exam administered by the SOA are exempted from this class and can substitute an elective.\nThis course provides an introduction to the tools for pricing and reserving for short term insurance. We will discuss methods for calculating IBNR reserves, ratemaking, frequency and severity models used for modeling coverage modifications, statistical methods for fitting, evaluating, and selecting parametric models for frequency and severity, and three credibility methods.\nThis class covers the short-term material of Exam FAM and also covers the material of Exam ASTAM of the Society of Actuaries, and some of the material on Exams MAS I, MAS II, and 5 of the Casualty Actuarial Society. This is a core class of the Actuarial Science program. Students who have already taken and passed the FAM exam (or its short term portion) and the ASTAM exam administered by the SOA are exempted from this class and can substitute an elective.\nThis course discusses three extensions to the modeling methods discussed in the Predictive Modeling course:  ARIMA and ARCH/GARCH time series models, linear and generalized linear mixed models, and Bayesian methods for estimating linear and generalized linear models, including the use of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to estimate the posterior distribution.  In addition, the course briefly discusses various graphical techniques for evaluating insurance pricing models.\nThis class covers most of the material of Exam MAS II of the Casualty Actuarial Society. This is a core course of the Actuarial Science program. Students may take either this course or Advanced Actuarial Methods. Those who have already taken and passed the MAS II exam for CAS are exempted from this class and can substitute an elective.\nFamiliarity with linear and generalized linear models covered in Predictive Modeling in Finance and Insurance (PS5840) is helpful. Prior exposure to linear algebra, calculus, statistics, and a working knowledge of R and spreadsheets are necessary. Exposure to credibility concepts covered in Actuarial Models may also be useful.\nThis course introduces to the students, generalized linear models (GLM), time series models, and some popular statistical learning models such as decision trees models as well as random forests and boosting trees.  The aim for GLM is to provide a flexible framework for the analysis and model building using the likelihood techniques for almost any data type. The aim for the statistical learning models is to build and predict or understand data structure (if unsupervised) using statistical learning methods such as tree-based for supervised learning and the Principle Component Analysis and Clustering for unsupervised learning.  It develops a student’s knowledge of the theoretical basis in predictive modeling, computational implementation of the models and their application in finance and insurance. Tools such as cross-validation and techniques such as regularization and dimension reduction for fitting and selecting models are explored.  We also implement these models using a combination of Excel and R.\nThe class covers the material of Exams, Statistics for Risk Modeling (SRM) and Predictive Analytics (PA) of Society of Actuaries, and some material of Exams, Modern Actuarial Statistics I (MAS-I) and MAS II by the Casualty Actuarial Society. This is a core course for the Actuarial Science students. Students who have already taken and passed the SRM and PA exams administered by the SOA are exempted from this class and can substitute an elective.\nThis course explores machine learning models, their theoretical basis, computing implementation and applications in finance and insurance.  It discusses machine learning models for regression, classification and unsupervised learning;  tools such as cross validation and  techniques such as regularization, dimension reduction and ensemble learning;  and select algorithms for fitting machine learning models.  This course offers students an intensive hands-on experience where they combine theoretical understanding, domain knowledge and coding skills to better inform data-driven decision making.\nSome topics covered are relevant to the statistical learning portion of the Society of Actuaries (SOA) and the Casualty Actuarial Society (CAS) curricula, and the quantitative methods section of the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) Institute curriculum.  This is a core course of the Actuarial Science program.\nIndustry representatives conduct a series of noncredit seminar sessions designed to expose students to the actuarial profession as well as to address a range of topics in actuarial science.\nAll full-time students are required to enroll in PS5900 Proseminar in Actuarial Science.\nThis course will provide an overview of life insurance company structure, life insurance products, product development and pricing considerations, investments and the regulations and liabilities that drive life insurance company decisions. All life insurance actuaries must master the concepts of financial mathematics and how to apply those concepts to calculate projected present values and accumulated cash flows. You will study these concepts and apply them to calculate basic reserves, new business pricing, and profitability metrics. This will include exploring various types of product designs. Actuaries play an important part in development and interpretation of the various financial statements that insurance companies are required to provide to the public. The course will illustrate the content of the most important statements, exhibits, and schedules and provide a description of their purpose. Insurance cash flows are unique in that there are many uncertainties and those cash flows stretch out into the future over a considerable amount of time. This leads to another important aspect of actuarial science, which is risk analysis and risk management. This course will study how companies map risks and set aside capital to provide for the uncertainties above and beyond those provided for by standard reserves, including an introduction to evolving uses of predictive analytics and enterprise risk management by insurance companies.\nFinally, the course will cover current evolving trends, e.g., the growth of online life insurance products and services.\nThis course develops an understanding of the fundamental concepts of financial mathematics, and how\r\nthose concepts are applied in calculating present and accumulated values for various streams of cash\r\nflows as a basis for future use in: reserving, valuation, pricing, asset/liability management, investment\r\nincome, capital budgeting, and valuing contingent cash flows. The candidate will also be given an\r\nintroduction to financial instruments, including derivatives, and the concept of no-arbitrage as it relates to\r\nfinancial mathematics.\nThe Financial Mathematics Exam assumes a basic knowledge of calculus and an introductory knowledge\r\nof probability.\nThe first half of this course introduces key financial markets including interest rates, equity, foreign exchange, mortgage, and some derivatives. It also discusses interactions of the Federal Reserve and the securities firms and their effects on the markets. The 2nd half introduces some key metrics used in managing insurance companies including earnings, regulatory/economic capital and embedded value. These metrics are discussed in the context of insurance risks, financial markets, and regulatory regimes. The 2nd half also provides an overview of the major actuarial/finance functions in a typical insurance company (i.e. Valuation, Pricing, Risk, etc.) and more importantly how they use these metrics to manage profitability and risk. The course is intended to provide students with a broader background when dealing with financial and insurance products.\nThis course also touches on many topics required for the upper level actuarial exams by the SOA and should help lay the conceptual foundation. These exams include Corporate Finance, ERM, Individual Life and Annuity pricing and risk management, Life Finance and Valuation, and Investment Risk Management.\nThis course is a workshop in ERISA and Taxation Rules for Actuaries. Actuarial science can be applied and cover a number of welfare benefit arrangements (such as life insurance, medical, disability, severance etc.), qualified plans and nonqualified deferred compensation plans. The services and products that are developed in the actuarial field may be governed by certain federal laws. In the U.S., these arrangements are governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\"ERISA\"). In addition, certain federal taxation and reporting rules may apply. To be successful in the field will require an understanding of these rules, reporting requirements, taxation rules and the government agencies (Internal Revenue Service, Department of Labor and Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation) responsible for oversight of such arrangements. Other topics covered will include SEPs, Simple Plans, 403(b) plans, 457 plans and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plans.\nThe goal of this elective course is to provide you with a broad understanding of fixed income securities and how they are used for asset liability management (ALM) in financial institutes. This course is designed for individuals who currently work or plan to work as insurance and financial professionals such as actuaries, traders, and quants. The course builds on concepts introduced in several of the program’s core courses and emphasizes the application of theories. The course covers content adapted from the SOA syllabus for fellowship exams and is split into four parts: interest rate risk measurements, interest rate management—ALM strategy, ALM decision-based asset allocation, and value-based management. In this course, you will learn several ALM techniques related to mitigating interest rate risks, managing risk and return trade-offs, and setting strategic asset allocation (SAA) to achieve an optimized risk/return portfolio. Additionally, you will be introduced to the concepts of value-based management and economic value of liabilities. Completing this course will give you a fundamental basis for understanding ALM in financial organizations and further prepare you to apply these concepts in real-life situations under both generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and market consistent approaches.\nThis course introduces general principles of ratemaking and reserving as they relate to P&C insurance products. Students will learn actuarial conventions and terminology and structure insurance data accordingly. We will discuss techniques needed to restate historical premium and loss information at current levels and derive consistent profitability metrics. Advantages and disadvantages of various traditional pricing and reserving techniques will be discussed as well as classification of insureds and other important topics.\nThis course discusses topics in database navigation, select advanced predictive analytics models, and model interpretability.

This course offers students an intensive hands-on experience where they combine theoretical understanding, domain knowledge and coding skills to better inform data-driven decision-making.\nTopics covered are relevant to the Advanced Topics in Predictive Analytics (ATPA) exam of the Society of Actuaries.  Topics in deep learning are also relevant to the statistical learning portion of the Casualty Actuarial Society (CAS) curriculum, and the quantitative methods section of the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) Institute curriculum.\nThis course will introduce students to major issues currently of concern to all investors. It can give you the skills to conduct a sophisticated assessment of current issues and debates covered by the popular media as well as more-specialized finance journals. These skills are essential for people who pursues a financial service career, especially in today’s rapidly evolving environment. The material presented in this course are both practical important and intellectually interesting.\nThis course is consistent with and relevant to Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) curriculum. It covers all subjects in CFA test and most of problems are in the same format as the CFA examination questions. This course will also provide a foundation for further study in Financial Risk Management and Financial market related courses.\nRisk Management becomes more and more important in the financial industry especially after the global financial crisis. Large financial institutions are facing high regulatory pressure from the government and public. In response to this pressure, risk management in the financial industry has been transformed dramatically over the past decade. Today, about 50 percent of the function’s staff are dedicated to risk-related operational processes such as credit administration, while 15 percent work in analytics. McKinsey research suggests that by 2025, these numbers will reach 25 and 40 percent, respectively.\nThis course is designed to provide students with a high-level overview of modern risk management. This is then followed by an in-depth examination of the techniques and management structures used to assess and control risk, including a detailed discussion on the implementation of Value-at-Risk, which is becoming the de facto standard for measuring risk across all the major classes: market, credit, liquidity and operational.\nThis course is consistent with and relevant to Financial Risk Manager (FRM) curriculum. It covers majority of FRM learning objectives in the test and it is deeper in the quantitative modelling and analysis.\nInsurance company risk management practices and requirements have evolved significantly over the last ten years, with the advances in regulation (e.g., Solvency II, NAIC ORSA) and rating agency oversight. This elective course is designed for individuals interested in moving into risk analysis roles within property and casualty (P&C) insurance, also known as general insurance. It provides a practical review of leading quantitative risk assessment and analysis practices at P&C insurance companies. The course will give you a sound understanding of quantitative risk analysis principles that will help you expand your influence in your organization and improve the way you communicate about risk to regulators, rating agencies, and boards. The course focuses on current industry practices, critical analysis skills of risk, and the development and delivery of professional work products, to influence decision makers.\nThe course is divided into three parts:\nThis course is a workshop in communication techniques and professional development. Students make presentations individually and in teams. Actuarial science can be complex and to be successful in the field will require effective communication skills to simplify and explain the complex.  The course covers communicating effectively, professional development, structuring presentations, delivery techniques and presentations.  The main objective for the course is to help students take the complex including business trends and communicate it in a manner that can be understood by the target audience. We will focus on improving communication skills, networking, interview skills, job opportunities and career development.\nThis course covers how to generate reliable and sustainable incomes based on available resources and manage the key risks in retirement (or in the state of financial independence (FI)). We discuss the overall framework and the process and examine the major products and strategies used in practice, with a special focus on the areas related to actuarial science, such as the key insurance products (annuities, life insurance, and long-term care insurance) commonly used, how to position various investments in different types of accounts and withdraw in the most tax efficient manner to meet the income needs. Effective strategies to manage the top risks (longevity, inflation, sequence of return, liquidity, long-term care, and frailty) will also be covered.\nThis course is particularly applicable to students who are looking to develop their skills in a particular area of application of actuarial science. The course is delivered in a project format that will integrate specific elements of the curriculum into an applied project, giving students hands-on actuarial science application experience. Students may team up and undertake a special actuarial project and present as consultants or in house actuaries to a panel of actuaries who will grade the overall effectiveness of their approach, solution and communication. This course will help students increase their understanding of the real-world constraints under which actuaries operate.

Request Information\nCourses typically meet one or two times a week. Many courses are also offered during the day, as well.\nIndividualized programs of study may be developed to accommodate those students who have completed some of the required coursework prior to entering the program as well as those students who wish to do additional coursework in risk management, data analysis, and mathematical finance.\nAdvanced students may take electives in mathematical finance, risk management, and advanced statistical methods.\nProbability is the foundation on which statistics is built. The purposes of this course are 1) to introduce you to probability and 2) prepare you to take a sequel course on statistical inference (Statistics 4204,5204).\nWe shall begin by covering the basic axioms of probability and using these in some simple settings. Then we will take up the idea of independence and conditional probability. Following we shall consider random variables, and the properties first of univariate discrete and continuous distributions. When we look at two or more variables, additional considerations arise, such as the relationship between the variables|conditional distributions and marginal distributions. Following these basics, we will then take up some ways of summarizing distributions, e.g., expectations and variances and, in summarizing relationships among variables, covariance and correlation. We then take up some of the more important distributions in statistics. In particular, for the discrete case, we will study the Bernoulli and binomial distributions and the generalization to the multinomial distribution, also the Poisson distribution. For continuous distributions, we take up the univariate and bivariate normal, the Gamma and the Beta distribution. In statistical applications, sums of independent random variables (for example, a sample average is such a sum, divided by sample size) are extremely important and characterizing the properties of these in large samples justifies many of the ways in which we make inferences in statistics. Thus, we take up the properties of these sums in large samples, focusing on stating laws of large numbers and also a simple central limit theorem.\nThe aim of the course is to describe the two aspects of statistics {estimation and inference {in some details. The topics will include maximum likelihood estimation, Bayesian inference, confidence intervals, bootstrap methods, some nonparametric tests, statistical hypothesis testing, linear regression models, ANOVA, etc.\nThis course explores actuarial models for life contingent risks, their theoretical basis and application.  It discusses survival models, life tables, life insurance and annuity benefits, premium and reserve calculations related to policies on a single life.\nThis course covers the material of the long term portion of the Fundamentals of Actuarial Mathematics (FAM) exam of the Society of Actuaries (SOA).  This is a core course of the Actuarial Science program. Students who have already passed the MLC exam, the LTAM exam or the FAM exam (or its long term portion) administered by the SOA are exempted from this class and can substitute an elective\nThis course is a continuation of Actuarial Methods I. It discusses Markov chains and their application to a wide variety of long term insurance products, fundamentals of pension liabilities, profit tests, universal life, and equity-linked insurance. This class, along with Actuarial Methods I, covers the material of Exam LTAM of the Society of Actuaries. Students who have already taken and passed the ALTAM exam or the LTAM exam administered by the SOA are exempted from this class and can substitute an elective.\nThis course provides an introduction to the tools for pricing and reserving for short term insurance. We will discuss methods for calculating IBNR reserves, ratemaking, frequency and severity models used for modeling coverage modifications, statistical methods for fitting, evaluating, and selecting parametric models for frequency and severity, and three credibility methods.\nThis class covers the short-term material of Exam FAM and also covers the material of Exam ASTAM of the Society of Actuaries, and some of the material on Exams MAS I, MAS II, and 5 of the Casualty Actuarial Society. This is a core class of the Actuarial Science program. Students who have already taken and passed the FAM exam (or its short term portion) and the ASTAM exam administered by the SOA are exempted from this class and can substitute an elective.\nThis course discusses three extensions to the modeling methods discussed in the Predictive Modeling course:  ARIMA and ARCH/GARCH time series models, linear and generalized linear mixed models, and Bayesian methods for estimating linear and generalized linear models, including the use of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to estimate the posterior distribution.  In addition, the course briefly discusses various graphical techniques for evaluating insurance pricing models.\nThis class covers most of the material of Exam MAS II of the Casualty Actuarial Society. This is a core course of the Actuarial Science program. Students may take either this course or Advanced Actuarial Methods. Those who have already taken and passed the MAS II exam for CAS are exempted from this class and can substitute an elective.\nFamiliarity with linear and generalized linear models covered in Predictive Modeling in Finance and Insurance (PS5840) is helpful. Prior exposure to linear algebra, calculus, statistics, and a working knowledge of R and spreadsheets are necessary. Exposure to credibility concepts covered in Actuarial Models may also be useful.\nThis course introduces to the students, generalized linear models (GLM), time series models, and some popular statistical learning models such as decision trees models as well as random forests and boosting trees.  The aim for GLM is to provide a flexible framework for the analysis and model building using the likelihood techniques for almost any data type. The aim for the statistical learning models is to build and predict or understand data structure (if unsupervised) using statistical learning methods such as tree-based for supervised learning and the Principle Component Analysis and Clustering for unsupervised learning.  It develops a student’s knowledge of the theoretical basis in predictive modeling, computational implementation of the models and their application in finance and insurance. Tools such as cross-validation and techniques such as regularization and dimension reduction for fitting and selecting models are explored.  We also implement these models using a combination of Excel and R.\nThe class covers the material of Exams, Statistics for Risk Modeling (SRM) and Predictive Analytics (PA) of Society of Actuaries, and some material of Exams, Modern Actuarial Statistics I (MAS-I) and MAS II by the Casualty Actuarial Society. This is a core course for the Actuarial Science students. Students who have already taken and passed the SRM and PA exams administered by the SOA are exempted from this class and can substitute an elective.\nThis course explores machine learning models, their theoretical basis, computing implementation and applications in finance and insurance.  It discusses machine learning models for regression, classification and unsupervised learning;  tools such as cross validation and  techniques such as regularization, dimension reduction and ensemble learning;  and select algorithms for fitting machine learning models.  This course offers students an intensive hands-on experience where they combine theoretical understanding, domain knowledge and coding skills to better inform data-driven decision making.\nSome topics covered are relevant to the statistical learning portion of the Society of Actuaries (SOA) and the Casualty Actuarial Society (CAS) curricula, and the quantitative methods section of the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) Institute curriculum.  This is a core course of the Actuarial Science program.\nIndustry representatives conduct a series of noncredit seminar sessions designed to expose students to the actuarial profession as well as to address a range of topics in actuarial science.\nAll full-time students are required to enroll in PS5900 Proseminar in Actuarial Science.\nThis course will provide an overview of life insurance company structure, life insurance products, product development and pricing considerations, investments and the regulations and liabilities that drive life insurance company decisions. All life insurance actuaries must master the concepts of financial mathematics and how to apply those concepts to calculate projected present values and accumulated cash flows. You will study these concepts and apply them to calculate basic reserves, new business pricing, and profitability metrics. This will include exploring various types of product designs. Actuaries play an important part in development and interpretation of the various financial statements that insurance companies are required to provide to the public. The course will illustrate the content of the most important statements, exhibits, and schedules and provide a description of their purpose. Insurance cash flows are unique in that there are many uncertainties and those cash flows stretch out into the future over a considerable amount of time. This leads to another important aspect of actuarial science, which is risk analysis and risk management. This course will study how companies map risks and set aside capital to provide for the uncertainties above and beyond those provided for by standard reserves, including an introduction to evolving uses of predictive analytics and enterprise risk management by insurance companies.\nFinally, the course will cover current evolving trends, e.g., the growth of online life insurance products and services.\nThis course develops an understanding of the fundamental concepts of financial mathematics, and how\r\nthose concepts are applied in calculating present and accumulated values for various streams of cash\r\nflows as a basis for future use in: reserving, valuation, pricing, asset/liability management, investment\r\nincome, capital budgeting, and valuing contingent cash flows. The candidate will also be given an\r\nintroduction to financial instruments, including derivatives, and the concept of no-arbitrage as it relates to\r\nfinancial mathematics.\nThe Financial Mathematics Exam assumes a basic knowledge of calculus and an introductory knowledge\r\nof probability.\nThe first half of this course introduces key financial markets including interest rates, equity, foreign exchange, mortgage, and some derivatives. It also discusses interactions of the Federal Reserve and the securities firms and their effects on the markets. The 2nd half introduces some key metrics used in managing insurance companies including earnings, regulatory/economic capital and embedded value. These metrics are discussed in the context of insurance risks, financial markets, and regulatory regimes. The 2nd half also provides an overview of the major actuarial/finance functions in a typical insurance company (i.e. Valuation, Pricing, Risk, etc.) and more importantly how they use these metrics to manage profitability and risk. The course is intended to provide students with a broader background when dealing with financial and insurance products.\nThis course also touches on many topics required for the upper level actuarial exams by the SOA and should help lay the conceptual foundation. These exams include Corporate Finance, ERM, Individual Life and Annuity pricing and risk management, Life Finance and Valuation, and Investment Risk Management.\nThis course is a workshop in ERISA and Taxation Rules for Actuaries. Actuarial science can be applied and cover a number of welfare benefit arrangements (such as life insurance, medical, disability, severance etc.), qualified plans and nonqualified deferred compensation plans. The services and products that are developed in the actuarial field may be governed by certain federal laws. In the U.S., these arrangements are governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\"ERISA\"). In addition, certain federal taxation and reporting rules may apply. To be successful in the field will require an understanding of these rules, reporting requirements, taxation rules and the government agencies (Internal Revenue Service, Department of Labor and Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation) responsible for oversight of such arrangements. Other topics covered will include SEPs, Simple Plans, 403(b) plans, 457 plans and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plans.\nThe goal of this elective course is to provide you with a broad understanding of fixed income securities and how they are used for asset liability management (ALM) in financial institutes. This course is designed for individuals who currently work or plan to work as insurance and financial professionals such as actuaries, traders, and quants. The course builds on concepts introduced in several of the program’s core courses and emphasizes the application of theories. The course covers content adapted from the SOA syllabus for fellowship exams and is split into four parts: interest rate risk measurements, interest rate management—ALM strategy, ALM decision-based asset allocation, and value-based management. In this course, you will learn several ALM techniques related to mitigating interest rate risks, managing risk and return trade-offs, and setting strategic asset allocation (SAA) to achieve an optimized risk/return portfolio. Additionally, you will be introduced to the concepts of value-based management and economic value of liabilities. Completing this course will give you a fundamental basis for understanding ALM in financial organizations and further prepare you to apply these concepts in real-life situations under both generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and market consistent approaches.\nThis course introduces general principles of ratemaking and reserving as they relate to P&C insurance products. Students will learn actuarial conventions and terminology and structure insurance data accordingly. We will discuss techniques needed to restate historical premium and loss information at current levels and derive consistent profitability metrics. Advantages and disadvantages of various traditional pricing and reserving techniques will be discussed as well as classification of insureds and other important topics.\nThis course discusses topics in database navigation, select advanced predictive analytics models, and model interpretability. Topics include relational databases, generalized additive models, deep learning models, linear mixed models, Bayesian approaches, and interpretable machine learning. This course offers students an intensive hands-on experience where they combine theoretical understanding, domain knowledge and coding skills to better inform data-driven decision-making.\nTopics covered are relevant to the Advanced Topics in Predictive Analytics (ATPA) exam of the Society of Actuaries.  Topics in deep learning are also relevant to the statistical learning portion of the Casualty Actuarial Society (CAS) curriculum, and the quantitative methods section of the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) Institute curriculum.\nThis course will introduce students to major issues currently of concern to all investors. It can give you the skills to conduct a sophisticated assessment of current issues and debates covered by the popular media as well as more-specialized finance journals. These skills are essential for people who pursues a financial service career, especially in today’s rapidly evolving environment. The material presented in this course are both practical important and intellectually interesting.\nThis course is consistent with and relevant to Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) curriculum. It covers all subjects in CFA test and most of problems are in the same format as the CFA examination questions. This course will also provide a foundation for further study in Financial Risk Management and Financial market related courses.\nRisk Management becomes more and more important in the financial industry especially after the global financial crisis. Large financial institutions are facing high regulatory pressure from the government and public. In response to this pressure, risk management in the financial industry has been transformed dramatically over the past decade. Today, about 50 percent of the function’s staff are dedicated to risk-related operational processes such as credit administration, while 15 percent work in analytics. McKinsey research suggests that by 2025, these numbers will reach 25 and 40 percent, respectively.\nThis course is designed to provide students with a high-level overview of modern risk management. This is then followed by an in-depth examination of the techniques and management structures used to assess and control risk, including a detailed discussion on the implementation of Value-at-Risk, which is becoming the de facto standard for measuring risk across all the major classes: market, credit, liquidity and operational.\nThis course is consistent with and relevant to Financial Risk Manager (FRM) curriculum. It covers majority of FRM learning objectives in the test and it is deeper in the quantitative modelling and analysis.\nInsurance company risk management practices and requirements have evolved significantly over the last ten years, with the advances in regulation (e.g., Solvency II, NAIC ORSA) and rating agency oversight. This elective course is designed for individuals interested in moving into risk analysis roles within property and casualty (P&C) insurance, also known as general insurance. It provides a practical review of leading quantitative risk assessment and analysis practices at P&C insurance companies. The course will give you a sound understanding of quantitative risk analysis principles that will help you expand your influence in your organization and improve the way you communicate about risk to regulators, rating agencies, and boards. The course focuses on current industry practices, critical analysis skills of risk, and the development and delivery of professional work products, to influence decision makers.\nThe course is divided into three parts:\nThis course is a workshop in communication techniques and professional development. Students make presentations individually and in teams. Actuarial science can be complex and to be successful in the field will require effective communication skills to simplify and explain the complex.  The course covers communicating effectively, professional development, structuring presentations, delivery techniques and presentations.  The main objective for the course is to help students take the complex including business trends and communicate it in a manner that can be understood by the target audience. We will focus on improving communication skills, networking, interview skills, job opportunities and career development.\nThis course covers how to generate reliable and sustainable incomes based on available resources and manage the key risks in retirement (or in the state of financial independence (FI)). We discuss the overall framework and the process and examine the major products and strategies used in practice, with a special focus on the areas related to actuarial science, such as the key insurance products (annuities, life insurance, and long-term care insurance) commonly used, how to position various investments in different types of accounts and withdraw in the most tax efficient manner to meet the income needs. Effective strategies to manage the top risks (longevity, inflation, sequence of return, liquidity, long-term care, and frailty) will also be covered.\nThis course is particularly applicable to students who are looking to develop their skills in a particular area of application of actuarial science. The course is delivered in a project format that will integrate specific elements of the curriculum into an applied project, giving students hands-on actuarial science application experience. Students may team up and undertake a special actuarial project and present as consultants or in house actuaries to a panel of actuaries who will grade the overall effectiveness of their approach, solution and communication. This course will help students increase their understanding of the real-world constraints under which actuaries operate. The course also serves the purpose of sharpening the students analytical and communication skills, by allowing them to apply their previous experience and knowledge gained from the program to real-world problems.\nReview of elements of probability theory.
