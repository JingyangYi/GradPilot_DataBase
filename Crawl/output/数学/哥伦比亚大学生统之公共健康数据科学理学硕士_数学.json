The length of the 36-credit program varies with the background, training, and experience of individual students. Most complete the program within two years (four semesters) and begin their studies in the fall semester.\nIn addition to fulfilling their course work, all PHDS students complete a one-term practicum and capstone experience.

The MS/PHDS Track provides core training in biostatistical theory, methods, and applications, but adds a distinct emphasis on modern approaches to statistical learning, reproducible and transparent code, and data management. It is an appropriate program for students who intend to conclude their studies with the MS degree as well as those who want to pursue a PhD in biostatistics.\nAll MS/PHDS candidates begin their studies in the fall semester. The length of the MS/PHDS program varies with the background, training, and experience of the candidate, but the usual period needed to complete the 36 credit MS/PHDS degree is two years (four semesters). In addition to fulfilling their course work, all MS/PHDS students also complete a one-term practicum and capstone experience.\nThrough a curriculum of 36 credit hours of course work, a practicum, and the capstone experience, the MS/PHDS track provides students with the skills necessary for a career as a public health data scientist and a rigorous grounding in traditional biostatistics.\nMS Students in PHDS gain the following competencies in the areas of public health and collaborative research, the foundations of applied data science, teaching biostatistics and biostatistical research.

Some students, such as those with undergraduate majors in statistics or mathematics, may apply to have several courses waived. Students wishing to waive one or more courses must request approval in writing from their advisors and the Director of Academic Programs. These students must still complete a minimum of 36 points to earn the MS/PHDS degree.\nThe curriculum is described in the MS handbook.
