The development and application of techniques to better understand this data is the fundamental concern of our program. We offer training in statistics and biostatistics theory, computer implementation of analytic methods, and opportunities to use this knowledge in areas of biological and medical research.\nBerkeley Public Health and UC Berkeley’s Department of Statistics, together with other UC Berkeley departments, offer a broad set of opportunities to satisfy the needs of individual students. In addition, the involvement of faculty from UCSF’s Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology enriches our instructional and research activities.\nOur master’s program is a two-year program consisting of 48 units with courses selected from biostatistics and statistics, public health, and biology.\nThe oral comprehensive examination is designed to test a candidate’s breadth of understanding and knowledge, as well as the ability to articulate and explain the basic concepts gained from the curriculum. Alternatively, a thesis may be submitted to fulfill requirements. However, the decision to submit a thesis rather than take the oral examination must be made early in the final semester of the program.\nStudents should take the following courses:\nIn addition to Statistics 201A and 201B and PH C240A, students are expected to take PH252D (Introduction to Causal Inference) and at least two other courses from the following list:\nPrevious coursework in calculus, linear algebra, and statistics is strongly recommended.\nCommon undergraduate majors for admitted applicants: Biomedical & biological sciences, mathematics, statistics. Common work experience for admitted applicants: Typical successful applicants have work experience in Research Assistant positions at a health department.\nGRE General Test scores are required for admission to the Biostatistics MA program however applicants are exempted from the requirement if they meet all of the following criteria:\nBerkeley Public Health also exempts applicants who already hold a doctoral level degree from the GRE requirement.You can find more information on the application instructions page. There is a program page in the Berkeley Graduate Application where you can indicate you meet the criteria for GRE exemption. Applicants who are exempted from the GRE are not at a disadvantage in the application review process.\nSome students pursuing the MA degree intend to continue directly into a PhD program, while others take research positions in tech companies, federal agencies, state and local health departments, health care delivery organizations, and private industry. MA students interested in continuing into the UC Berkeley Biostatistics doctoral program immediately following their MA degree should apply to the new degree program through the Online Application for Admission during their second year of study during the normal admissions cycle.\nProspective students who are US citizens or permanent residents can find more information about applying for an application fee waiver for the Berkeley Graduate Application. Fees will be waived based on financial need or participation in selected programs described on the linked website. International applicants (non-US citizens or Permanent Residents) are not eligible for application fee waivers.\nSome MA and MA/PhD admitted students are made a funding offer as a part of their admission package. These offers depend on funding availability and the applicant pool for that year.\nTuition and fees change each academic year. To view the current tuition and fees, see the fee schedule on the Office of the Registrar website (in the Graduate: Academic section).\nPlease contact biostat@berkeley.edu if you have any questions about funding opportunities for the biostatistics programs.\nThe Division of Biostatistics is committed to challenging systemic inequities in the areas of health, medical, and biological sciences, and to advancing the goals of diversity, equity, and inclusivity in Biostatistics and related fields.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion in Biostatistics\n• STAT 201A: Introduction to Probability at an Advanced Level\n• STAT 201B: Introduction to Statistics at an Advanced Level\n• PH C240A: Introduction to Modern Biostatistical Theory and Practice\n• PH C240B: Biostatistical Methods: Survival Analysis and Causality\n• PH 240C: Computational Statistics\n• PH 252E: Advanced Topics in Causal Inference\n• PH 244: Big Data: A Public Health Perspective\n• CS 294.150: Machine Learning and Statistics Meet Biology\n• PH C242C: Longitudinal Data Analysis\n• PH 290.X: Targeted Learning in Biomedical Big Data\n• Completed two semesters of calculus for a letter grade and earned a grade of “B” or higher.\n• Completed one semester of linear algebra for a letter grade and earned a grade of “B” or higher.\n• Completed one semester of statistics for a letter grade and earned a grade of “B” or higher.\n• Cumulative undergraduate GPA of 3.0 or higher.\n• Overall quantitative/math GPA of 3.0 or higher.\n• For international students: TOEFL score of 100 or higher OR IELTS score of 7.0 or higher\n• More information about funding and fee remission\n\nSome MA and MA/PhD admitted students are made a funding offer as a part of their admission package.

There is a program page in the Berkeley Graduate Application where you can indicate you meet the criteria for GRE exemption. Applicants who are exempted from the GRE are not at a disadvantage in the application review process.\nA Master’s degree in Biostatistics or a related field is recommended but not required for admission to the PhD program. Strongly recommended prerequisite courses include calculus, linear algebra, and statistics. Applicants admitted without a Master’s degree may be required to go through the Biostatistics MA curriculum; students can concurrently earn that degree with no additional cost. Applicants without a Master’s degree are expected to have extensive related research and/or professional experience. Normative time to degree is 5 years.\nSubmissions of GRE scores are optional but recommended for this program, especially if you have no other evidence of quantitative, verbal, or analytical abilities in your application.\nSubmissions of GRE scores are optional but strongly recommended for this program. Especially if you have no other evidence of quantitative, verbal, or analytical abilities in your application.

However, please thoroughly look at the requirements and qualifications of the program you are applying to for more guidance. Overall, it will be in your best interest to have three individuals who can attest to your academic and/or professional ability to succeed in a public health career.\nFor academic references, we recommend you ask professors who you think will write the strongest recommendations. A strong quality letter attesting to your ability to succeed in the program will weigh more than a generic letter from a high-ranking professor.\nBerkeley Public Health does not accept hard-copy letters sent to our offices.\nRequesting Recommendations\nIn the application’s Recommendations section, enter the contact information for each recommender and send the email requests. (If your recommender does not receive the request, contact sphadmit@berkeley.edu)\nRecommenders will upload letters directly to your application.

It is intended to give you the opportunity to provide a narrative about your diverse personal experiences.

Use this essay to provide context on your other application materials, and elaborate on anything that may be helpful for the admissions committee to be aware of.\nNote: Not all schools require a Personal History Statement but we do.\nHere are some best practices from the DREAM Office and the UC Berkeley Graduate Division on how to write the personal history statement.\n• Writing Sample (required for Environmental Health Sciences PhD applicants only)\n\nA writing sample that highlights your writing and analytical skills is required.
