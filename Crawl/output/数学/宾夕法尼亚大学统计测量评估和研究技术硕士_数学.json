The program provides understanding and skills in data collection, management, and processing; measurement theory and test construction; survey design; design and execution of randomized controlled experiments and quasi-experiments; assessment strategies; and statistical analysis and reporting in education. Graduates of the SMART program go on to become researchers and statistical analysts in organizations such as school districts, government agencies, research centers, educational testing companies, and educational research institutes.\nFor more information: https://www.gse.upenn.edu/academics/programs/education-statistics-measurement-assessment-research-masters\n10 CUs are required for the Statistics, Measurement, Assessment, and Research Technology (SMART) MSEd Program.\nThe student must earn a grade of \"B\" or better.\nCandidates for the MSEd degree must demonstrate knowledge of the field of education beyond the area of specialization. This requirement is met by satisfying the distribution requirement. To meet the distribution requirement students must complete one approved graduate level (5000 or above) GSE course outside the academic division in which they are enrolled, earning a grade of 'B' or better.\nStudents are required to take two elective courses at the 5000 level or above. These courses can be taken at other Penn schools with permission from the advisor and the school in question. The student must also earn a grade of 'B' or better\nThe SMART Program of study for the M.S.Ed. degree requires that students have had an introductory statistics course, such as EDUC 6667 or its equivalent, prior to entering the SMART Program. If it is discovered that an entering student is insufficiently prepared in statistics, the student will be required to enroll in EDUC 6667.  This will count as an elective in the student’s required 10 CUs.  The SMART requirement for a student having had EDUC 6667, or its equivalent, prior to program entry applies to all part-time and all full- time students entering the program, whether employed by the university or not.\nThe degree and major requirements displayed are intended as a guide for students entering in the Fall of 2025 and later.

This year, the timely topic for the weekend’s panel was “Discourse and Democracy: The Classroom as a Catalyst for Bridging Differences,” exploring how educators can facilitate open and constructive classroom conversations in polarized times.\nOn board for the crucial conversation were Dean Katharine Strunk, MRMJJ Professor Sigal Ben-Porath, and Associate Professor Abby Reisman. All three are deeply committed to discourse around difference and education’s place in democratic society. Ben-Porath, who literally wrote the book on free speech on campus, and Reisman, an expert in social studies teacher education, even co-teach a course on classroom discourse. And the dean has made this topic a cornerstone of Together for Good, her strategic vision for the School.\n“Cultivating the capacity and the dispositions that are the foundation for a good and productive dialogue, for me, is really the linchpin of the connection between democracy and knowledge—two things we try to cultivate in college,” said Ben-Porath, who is also the faculty director for the SNF Paideia Program, which offers holistic personal, professional, and civic development for undergraduates.\nDean Strunk began the discussion by noting that of all the Penn GSE courses she would like to take herself, Ben-Porath and Reisman’s “Classroom Discourse” one is at the top of her list.  Reisman noted that the pair have been talking about the class since they first met 11 years ago, even though they only just finished their second year teaching it.\n“There’s an argument to the class, right? And it is that discussion is essential,” said Reisman. “It’s essential for three reasons: We need to be open to multiple perspectives. We need to be able to recognize that our own ideas change. And we need to recognize that knowledge is constructed and changing. And all of that is in the service of democracy.” The goal of their class isn’t to debate “hot-button issues,” but to explore the idea of discussion from all angles—legal, sociocultural, organizational, preparational—and to develop an appreciation for how complex it is. They use a SAC format (which stands for Structured Academic Controversy), which, Reisman warned “looks like a debate, smells like a debate, and sounds like a debate but isn’t one because the ultimate goal of a debate is winning.” The SAC, instead, emphasizes the importance of listening. Part of the structure, Reisman said, requires one side to repeat the other side’s words back to them. “The point is not persuasion,” said Ben-Porath. “The point is not to get somebody to change their mind. It’s an effort to experience the opposite argument as not stupid, not worthless, not immoral.”\nThe three panelists all agreed that, even in the current divided moment, people seem eager for the space to have these types of dialogues—especially on campuses.\n“Hunger for opportunities to engage deeply with others across various lines of difference is present in the undergraduate population,” said Ben-Porath, as well as across Penn’s graduate schools.\nReisman encouraged educators wary of controversy in their classrooms to plan for dialogues by thoughtfully crafting the questions that start them.\n“Often, I think people plan for discussion by identifying a topic for discussion—but that’s just the first step,” she said. “I want teachers to think really carefully about how they are framing the question to be discussed.”\nShe suggested three criteria for such planning: Is this topic discussed in good faith in the public sphere? Can discussing it further illuminate the topic for people? And does the phrasing of the question risk harming the dignity or humanity of your students? (The answers, she said, should be yes, yes, and no.)\nBut even before educators get to designing their questions to spur discussion, Reisman said they need to have done the hard work of establishing norms and the culture of their classroom ahead of time. These should include giving students tools to talk about their feelings and making sure all members feel welcomed, as well as offering opportunities for the class to reflect on the norms.\nBut, asked the dean, reading a question submitted from an audience member, how do we have respectful dialogue when we can’t even agree on what is true?\n“I think about truth and reality, for the purpose of learning, in three layers,” said Ben-Porath. “One is the answer to a certain question. And then the second one is the evidence that we might bring to bear. And the third is, who might we ask or consult if we can’t agree on the previous two? It’s a question of knowledge, it’s a question of evidence, and it’s a question of expertise. And we sometimes collapse the three of them when we have a disagreement, but it’s helpful to start with, which of the levels are we disagreeing about?”\nFollowing the panel, the Alumni Weekend festivities concluded with the Celebration of Educators, a ceremony honoring the seven recipients of this year’s Education Alumni Awards, as well the staff, faculty, and student annual award winners, as decided by Penn GSE students.\nLearn more about these exemplary alumni and community members in the event’s program and enjoy a photo gallery of the festivities here.\nPenn GSE Communications is here to help reporters connect with the education experts they need.\nExecutive Director of Penn GSE Communications\n(215) 898-9642\nkatstein@upenn.edu\nIn the Media\n                        \n\n|\n\n                            Inside Higher Ed\nRobert Zemsky discusses the \"wild\" success of the College-in-3 movement, as well as some of the challenges it still faces, including resistance from some more traditional fields of study.\nPenn GSE Magazine\n                        \n\n\n                            Spring/Summer 2025 Penn GSE Magazine\nPenn GSE professors and programs are engaged in more than 150 international partnerships and projects in more than 60 countries around the globe.

This year, the timely topic for the weekend’s panel was “Discourse and Democracy: The Classroom as a Catalyst for Bridging Differences,” exploring how educators can facilitate open and constructive classroom conversations in polarized times.On board for the crucial conversation were Dean Katharine Strunk, MRMJJ Professor Sigal Ben-Porath, and Associate Professor Abby Reisman. All three are deeply committed to discourse around difference and education’s place in democratic society. Ben-Porath, who literally wrote the book on free speech on campus, and Reisman, an expert in social studies teacher education, even co-teach a course on classroom discourse. And the dean has made this topic a cornerstone of Together for Good, her strategic vision for the School.“Cultivating the capacity and the dispositions that are the foundation for a good and productive dialogue, for me, is really the linchpin of the connection between democracy and knowledge—two things we try to cultivate in college,” said Ben-Porath, who is also the faculty director for the SNF Paideia Program, which offers holistic personal, professional, and civic development for undergraduates.Dean Strunk began the discussion by noting that of all the Penn GSE courses she would like to take herself, Ben-Porath and Reisman’s “Classroom Discourse” one is at the top of her list.  Reisman noted that the pair have been talking about the class since they first met 11 years ago, even though they only just finished their second year teaching it.“There’s an argument to the class, right? And it is that discussion is essential,” said Reisman. “It’s essential for three reasons: We need to be open to multiple perspectives. We need to be able to recognize that our own ideas change. And we need to recognize that knowledge is constructed and changing. And all of that is in the service of democracy.” The goal of their class isn’t to debate “hot-button issues,” but to explore the idea of discussion from all angles—legal, sociocultural, organizational, preparational—and to develop an appreciation for how complex it is. They use a SAC format (which stands for Structured Academic Controversy), which, Reisman warned “looks like a debate, smells like a debate, and sounds like a debate but isn’t one because the ultimate goal of a debate is winning.” The SAC, instead, emphasizes the importance of listening. Part of the structure, Reisman said, requires one side to repeat the other side’s words back to them. “The point is not persuasion,” said Ben-Porath. “The point is not to get somebody to change their mind. It’s an effort to experience the opposite argument as not stupid, not worthless, not immoral.”The three panelists all agreed that, even in the current divided moment, people seem eager for the space to have these types of dialogues—especially on campuses.“Hunger for opportunities to engage deeply with others across various lines of difference is present in the undergraduate population,” said Ben-Porath, as well as across Penn’s graduate schools.Reisman encouraged educators wary of controversy in their classrooms to plan for dialogues by thoughtfully crafting the questions that start them.“Often, I think people plan for discussion by identifying a topic for discussion—but that’s just the first step,” she said. “I want teachers to think really carefully about how they are framing the question to be discussed.”She suggested three criteria for such planning: Is this topic discussed in good faith in the public sphere? Can discussing it further illuminate the topic for people? And does the phrasing of the question risk harming the dignity or humanity of your students? (The answers, she said, should be yes, yes, and no.)But even before educators get to designing their questions to spur discussion, Reisman said they need to have done the hard work of establishing norms and the culture of their classroom ahead of time. These should include giving students tools to talk about their feelings and making sure all members feel welcomed, as well as offering opportunities for the class to reflect on the norms.But, asked the dean, reading a question submitted from an audience member, how do we have respectful dialogue when we can’t even agree on what is true?“I think about truth and reality, for the purpose of learning, in three layers,” said Ben-Porath. “One is the answer to a certain question. And then the second one is the evidence that we might bring to bear. And the third is, who might we ask or consult if we can’t agree on the previous two? It’s a question of knowledge, it’s a question of evidence, and it’s a question of expertise. And we sometimes collapse the three of them when we have a disagreement, but it’s helpful to start with, which of the levels are we disagreeing about?”Following the panel, the Alumni Weekend festivities concluded with the Celebration of Educators, a ceremony honoring the seven recipients of this year’s Education Alumni Awards, as well the staff, faculty, and student annual award winners, as decided by Penn GSE students. \n\n\nDean Strunk (center, red dress) with this year's award winners: (from left) Brooks Bowden, GED'07, Aishwarya Manjunath Shetty, GED'23, Jamille Nagtalon-Ramos, GNU’03, GRD'17, Tony Szu-Hsien Lee, GR’99, Dandan (Sunny) Wu, GED’25, Damani White-Lewis, Kelly King, GED'19, Jenny Zapf, Wendy Green, GR'11, Peter Montesino, Mayowa Fageyinbo, SPP’24, GED’25, GM’25rachel dozier, Cory Zoblin, GED’13, John Gamba, Abby Reisman, Rachel Dozier,GED'24, and Meruyert Bizhanova, GED’25.
