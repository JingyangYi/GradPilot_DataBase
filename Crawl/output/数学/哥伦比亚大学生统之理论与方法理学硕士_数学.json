It also provides the necessary academic preparation for those who wish to pursue PhD-level training in biostatistics at a later date. The program's mathematical emphasis gives graduates a deeper foundation in statistical methods than the traditional MPH degree.\nThe length of the 36-credit program varies with the background, training, and experience of individual students. Most complete the program within two years (four semesters) and begin their studies in the fall semester.\nIn addition to fulfilling their course work, all TM students complete a one-term practicum and capstone experience. The practicum experience is an important element of the TM training, as it provides students with the opportunity to apply knowledge learned in the classroom to real-world situations and offers a taste of future career opportunities.\nApplicants should have some background in college mathematics, including at least a year of calculus. A semester of linear/matrix algebra is highly encouraged. Students with strong scores on the quantitative section of the GRE are given first preference. As with all Biostatistics programs, the most important ingredients for the MS/TM are a facility for quantitative reasoning and a true enjoyment of working with data.\nSearch the Columbia Directory to find current students in the program.\nView competencies, course requirements, sample schedules, and more in our Academics section.\nbiostats@cumc.columbia.edu\n[CARD]\nMaster of Science\nMaster of Science \n\n\n\n\n\nTheory and Methods\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Theory and Methods track (TM) provides comprehensive training in biostatistical theory and techniques for individuals seeking positions as statisticians in health-related research within a biomedical, clinical, or laboratory setting.

The MS/TM Track is the appropriate program for students who intend to conclude their studies with the MS degree as well as those who want to work in the field prior to pursuing a PhD in biostatistics. It provides a stronger mathematical foundation in statistical methods than does the MPH, and can be viewed either as a terminal professional degree or as a preparatory program for those wishing to pursue further doctoral study such as a PhD in biostatistics.\nAll MS/TM candidates begin their studies in the fall semester. The length of the MS/TM program varies with the background, training, and experience of the candidate, but the usual period needed to complete the 36 credit MS/TM degree is two years (four semesters). In addition to fulfilling their course work, all MS/TM students also complete a one-term practicum and capstone experience.\nThrough a curriculum of 36 credit hours of coursework, a practicum, and the capstone experience, the MS in Biostatistics Theory and Methods Track provides students with both the skills necessary for a career as a biostatistician and the background needed for doctoral study.\nMS students in the Theory and Methods Track gain the following competencies in the areas of public health and collaborative research, data management, teaching biostatistics and biostatistical research.

Each student's program is designed on an individual basis in consultation with a faculty advisor taking into consideration the student's prior educational experience.\nStudents who have mastered an academic area through previous training may have the corresponding course requirement waived. Some students, such as those with undergraduate majors in statistics or mathematics, may apply to have several courses waived. Students wishing to waive one or more courses must request approval in writing from their advisors and the Director of Academic Programs. These students must still complete a minimum of 36 points to earn the MS/TM degree.\nMS/TM students are also strongly advised to develop expertise in one or more statistical software packages (such as SAS) routinely used in several of the biostatistics courses. Knowledge of one or more computer programming languages is also useful. Students without knowledge of any software packages may acquire these skills by taking “mini-courses” offered at the Computer Center in the Health Sciences Library, or by enrolling in a biostatistics course devoted to teaching the use of software packages or programming languages, such as P6110 Statistical Computing with SAS.\nBelow is a sample timeline for MS/TM candidates. Note that course schedules change from year to year, so that class days/times in future years will differ from the sample schedule below; you must check the current course schedule for each year on the course directory page.\nOne term of practical experience is required of all students, providing educational opportunities that are different from and supplementary to the more academic aspects of the program. The practicum may be fulfilled during the school year or over the summer. Arrangements are made on an individual basis in consultation with faculty advisors who must approve both the proposed practicum project prior to its initiation, and the report submitted at the conclusion of the practicum experience.
