The program typically consists of two years of full-time study, including the the preparation of a Master's thesis. Requirements include courses in probability, mathematical statistics, and statistical methods including discrete data analysis, linear models, multivariate methods, survival analysis, statistical computing, and applied data analysis. All students take a course in epidemiology. An overview of the program appears here; for complete details see the GGEB Handbook.\nEach incoming MS student is assigned an academic advisor who serves as the student's primary mentor during the program, advising in course selection and related academic matters. An attempt is made to assign advisors to students with similar backgrounds and interests, although a student may petition the Director of Graduate Studies at any time to request a change of academic advisor.\nCandidates for the MS degree must complete 12 units of course credit and prepare a Master’s thesis.  Required courses cover probability, mathematical statistics, and statistical methods including linear models, longitudinal data analysis, survival analysis, statistical computing, and applied data analysis.  MS students will have the option to take the written qualifying exam but it is not required to obtain a masters in biostatistics.\nThe MS in Biostatistics typically requires four semesters of formal course work.  Students must complete nine units of required courses, three units of electives, and the Biostatistics in Practice and project requirements (see Section 7.3.9). The required courses are described below.  The courses in bold type are the “core” courses for the MS degree that are covered on the written qualifications examination.\nThe written qualifying examination is optional for MS students. This exam is offered each summer, in June, in conjunction with the Qualifications Evaluation Examination for the PhD.\nStudents in the MS program choose three additional units from a list of advanced courses in biostatistics and related topics.  At least two of these courses must be quantitative; the third may be in a related scientific field subject to approval by the Curriculum Committee Chair and Program Director.  A partial listing appears under the section on electives for the PhD program (Section 7.3.3).  In addition to these electives, BSTA 6220 Inference II and BSTA 7540 Advanced Survival Analysis, which are required courses for the PhD program, may be used as advanced electives for the MS program.  Courses not described here may be used as advanced electives for the MS program upon receiving approval from the Chair of the Curriculum Committee and the Program Chair.\nAll MS students must participate in the Biostatistics in Practice seminar and complete a Biostatistics in Practice project, which serves as the MS thesis.  The BIP project consists of a comprehensive analysis of a dataset and a report of the results. The BIP project may be completed in any semester.\nBSTA 6200: Probability (1)\n\t\t\tBSTA 6510: Linear Models (1) \n\t\t\tBSTA 5110: Biostatistics in Practice (1)\nBSTA 6210 Statistical Inference I (1) \n\t\t\tBSTA 6320 Statistical Methods for Categorical and Survival Data (1)\n\t\t\tBSTA xxxx  Elective\nBSTA 6560: Longitudinal and Survival Analysis (1 unit)\n\t\t\tAdvanced Electives (2)\nBiostatistics in Practice Project / MS Thesis\nBSTA 6700: Statistical Computing (1)\n\t\t\tAdvanced Elective (2)\nBiostatistics in Practice Project / MS Thesis Presentation\nOnly courses considered at the graduate level may be transferred from previous training.  A maximum of 4 course units may be transfered from graduate work for MS and 8 for PhD. Courses proposed for transfer credit must be relevant to training in biostatistics and may include courses in theory, methods, or towards a minor (see Section 7.3.6 regarding minors).  Transfer of credit must be approved by the Program Chair and the GGEB Chair.\nAt the beginning of each academic year, each student, in collaboration with his/her advisor, will prepare a proposal for the academic program including courses to be taken, courses to be transferred, and timelines for examinations and thesis preparation.\nThe PhD program aims to train independent researchers in biostatistics applications and methodology. The program includes the Master's program courses, comprehensive analysis of a dataset and reporting of results equivalent to the MS thesis, and at least one additional semester of advanced courses in statistical theory and methods. Students in the PhD program are also required to take courses toward a minor in biomedical science, pass both written and oral examinations, and successfully complete a doctoral dissertation. An overview of the program appears here; for complete details see the GGEB Handbook\nEach incoming PhD student is assigned an academic advisor who serves as the student's primary mentor during the first two years of the program, advising in course selection and related academic matters. Once a thesis advisor is selected, s/he will normally assume the role of academic advisor for the remainder of the student's program. The Graduate Program attempts to assign advisors to students with similar backgrounds and interests. A student may petition to change academic advisors at any time by request to the Director of Graduate Studies.\nThe PhD in Biostatistics typically requires five to six semesters of coursework and additional semesters devoted to dissertation research.  This is usually accomplished in four to five years of full-time study.  The standard course sequence for PhD students consists of 3 units in theory, 7 units in statistical methods, 2 units toward a minor and 3 units of electives in advanced theory and methods. In addition, a minimum of three semesters of lab rotations (BSTA 6990) are required.  In general, students are expected to have completed all required courses by the end of their 3th year (or equivalent for those who enter with a Masters degree).  In rare cases substitutions may be made.  Such alternatives must be pre-approved by the chair of the Curriculum Committee, the Program Chair, GGEB Chair and the director of the course being waived, who is in the best position to evaluate whether the necessary skills are met by the substitution.\nBelow are the required core courses; the courses in bold type are PhD “core” courses that are covered on the written qualifying examination.\nStudents are required to take 3 additional advanced electives; a partial listing of such courses is given below.  In addition to this list, other courses offered by departments outside of Biostatistics and Epidemiology may be appropriate advanced electives and may be used as an advanced elective for the PhD program upon receiving approval from the student’s academic advisor and the Program Chair.  Independent study or reading courses (BSTA 9990) are reserved for doctoral students who have passed the written qualifications examination and are either choosing a dissertation topic or undertaking the early stages of dissertation research.  At most one of the four required advanced electives may be a reading course, and only on a topic not offered as a formal course with a year.\nAll PhD students must participate in Biostatistics in Practice and complete a Biostatistics in Practice project, a requirement that students typically satisfy during the first or second year.\nAll students in the PhD program must provide teaching support for a course or courses offered by the Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology or related programs.\nA fundamental component of the PhD program is attendance at the weekly Biostatistics Seminar. All PhD students are required to attend this seminar series. Students are also encouraged to suggest experts from the field as potential seminar speakers to the Seminar Committee.\nStudents must complete a two-unit minor sequence in one or more areas of science relevant to biomedical research. Some possible subject areas for minor courses include epidemiology, genetics, biology, psychology, economics, computer science, and bioengineering. Minor courses are typically taken outside of the GGEB, with the exception of advanced epidemiology courses (beyond BSTA 5090) which may also be counted toward the minor. The two-unit minor sequence must be approved by the curriculum committee chair and the program chair.\nA written qualifications evaluation examination covering material in the required courses for the PhD degree is offered each summer, in June. All full-time PhD students are expected to sit for the examination after their first year of study, with the option to retake the exam the following year if needed.  No student is allowed to take either part of the exam more than twice. Students must pass this exam to continue in the graduate program.\nTo become a formal candidate for the PhD, a student must pass a candidacy examination, which generally focuses on the proposed dissertation research (see below) but may also cover related topics in biostatistics and the minor field. For additional information, see the University of Pennsylvania Graduate Catalog.\nThe PhD thesis is an original contribution to statistical methodology for biomedical applications. This can be accomplished either through a novel application of statistical methods to a given subject matter, the development of new statistical methods or theory, or a combination of new theory, methods and applications. Dissertation research culminates in a final dissertation examination, or thesis defense, which consists of an oral presentation by the candidate and an examination by the faculty. For details, see the Graduate Catalog.\nGoals and Objectives\nThe overall goal of the rotations is to expose students to biomedical research, and in particular research related to statistical methodology early in their training.  In addition, students will rotate through a number of different labs, in order to get a broad perspective on research and faculty.   This will also assist the students in identifying their research interests and dissertation topic earlier in their educational process.  In addition, both the students and faculty can assess whether they are a good match for possible dissertation advisor/advisee relationships. By the end of 21 months of training (summer of year 2) students who were initially funded by BGS will identify their dissertation advisor, have a foundation for the first topic in their dissertation work, and move off of BGS funding and onto funding that is related to their dissertation work. Students will normally identify their PhD mentor through working with them on a lab rotation.  Students who are funded by a training grant during their first 21 months in the program will remain on the training grant throughout their program.  Students who are currently funded or who have interests in receiving funding during their dissertation research from a training grant should discuss how to structure their lab rotations with the training grant director. Lab rotations that offer research experience in areas relevant to our training grants will be available each year.\nOnly courses considered at the graduate level may be transferred from previous training. A maximum of eight units may be transferred from previous training towards the PhD degree.  Courses proposed for transfer credit must be relevant to training in biostatistics and may include courses in theory and methods.  Transfer of credit must be approved by the Program Chair and the GGEB Chair.\nAt the end of each academic year, each student, in collaboration with his/her advisor, are reqjuired to prepare an individual development plan (IDP). The IDP will include a proposal for the academic program including courses to be taken, courses to be transferred, and timelines for examinations and thesis preparation.\nFT Courses:\nBSTA 6200:

Students are also encouraged to suggest experts from the field as potential seminar speakers to the Seminar Committee.\nMinor\nStudents must complete a two-unit minor sequence in one or more areas of science relevant to biomedical research. Some possible subject areas for minor courses include epidemiology, genetics, biology, psychology, economics, computer science, and bioengineering. Minor courses are typically taken outside of the GGEB, with the exception of advanced epidemiology courses (beyond BSTA 5090) which may also be counted toward the minor. The two-unit minor sequence must be approved by the curriculum committee chair and the program chair.\nQualifications Evaluation Examination\nA written qualifications evaluation examination covering material in the required courses for the PhD degree is offered each summer, in June. All full-time PhD students are expected to sit for the examination after their first year of study, with the option to retake the exam the following year if needed.  No student is allowed to take either part of the exam more than twice. Students must pass this exam to continue in the graduate program.\nCandidacy Examination\nTo become a formal candidate for the PhD, a student must pass a candidacy examination, which generally focuses on the proposed dissertation research (see below) but may also cover related topics in biostatistics and the minor field. For additional information, see the University of Pennsylvania Graduate Catalog.\nPhD Thesis\nThe PhD thesis is an original contribution to statistical methodology for biomedical applications. This can be accomplished either through a novel application of statistical methods to a given subject matter, the development of new statistical methods or theory, or a combination of new theory, methods and applications. Dissertation research culminates in a final dissertation examination, or thesis defense, which consists of an oral presentation by the candidate and an examination by the faculty. For details, see the Graduate Catalog.\nLab Rotations\nGoals and Objectives\nThe overall goal of the rotations is to expose students to biomedical research, and in particular research related to statistical methodology early in their training.  In addition, students will rotate through a number of different labs, in order to get a broad perspective on research and faculty.   This will also assist the students in identifying their research interests and dissertation topic earlier in their educational process.  In addition, both the students and faculty can assess whether they are a good match for possible dissertation advisor/advisee relationships. By the end of 21 months of training (summer of year 2) students who were initially funded by BGS will identify their dissertation advisor, have a foundation for the first topic in their dissertation work, and move off of BGS funding and onto funding that is related to their dissertation work. Students will normally identify their PhD mentor through working with them on a lab rotation.  Students who are funded by a training grant during their first 21 months in the program will remain on the training grant throughout their program.  Students who are currently funded or who have interests in receiving funding during their dissertation research from a training grant should discuss how to structure their lab rotations with the training grant director. Lab rotations that offer research experience in areas relevant to our training grants will be available each year.\nTransfer of Credit\nOnly courses considered at the graduate level may be transferred from previous training. A maximum of eight units may be transferred from previous training towards the PhD degree.  Courses proposed for transfer credit must be relevant to training in biostatistics and may include courses in theory and methods.  Transfer of credit must be approved by the Program Chair and the GGEB Chair.\nAcademic Program Proposals and Approvals\nAt the end of each academic year, each student, in collaboration with his/her advisor, are reqjuired to prepare an individual development plan (IDP). The IDP will include a proposal for the academic program including courses to be taken, courses to be transferred, and timelines for examinations and thesis preparation.\nTypical Course Sequence for Full-Time Students in the PhD Program Entering Fall of 2025\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSemester \n\n\nFunds\n\n\nPlans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nYear 1\n\n\nFall\n\n\nBGS\n\n\nFT Courses:\nBSTA 6200: Probability (1)\n\t\t\tBSTA 6510: Linear Models and Generalized Linear Models (1)\n\t\t\tBSTA 5110: Works in Progress (1)\n\t\t\tBSTA 6990: Lab Rotation\n\n\n\n\nSpring\n\n\nBGS\n\n\nFT Courses:\nBSTA 6210: Statistical Inference I (1)\n\t\t\tBSTA 6320: Statistical Methods for Categorical and Survival Data (Methods II) (1)\n\t\t\tAdvanced Elective\n\t\t\tBSTA 6990: Lab Rotation\n\n\n\n\nSummer\n\n\nBGS\n\n\nWritten Qualifications Examination\nBSTA 6990: Lab Rotation\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nYear 2\n\n\nFall\n\n\nBGS\n\n\nFT Courses:\nBSTA 6220: Statistical Inference II (1)\n\t\t\tBSTA 6560: Longitudinal Data Analyisis (1) \n\t\t\tAdvanced Elective\n\t\t\tBSTA 9900: MS Thesis Research\n\t\t\tBSTA 6990: Lab Rotation or BSTA 899: Pre Dissertation Lab Research (if a dissertation advisor has been chosen)\n\n\n\n\nSpring\n\n\nBGS\n\n\nFT Courses:\nBSTA 6700: Statistical Computing (1)\n\t\t\tAdvanced Electives Minor (2)\n\t\t\tBSTA 6990: Lab Rotation or BSTA 899: Pre Dissertation Lab Research (if a dissertation advisor has been chosen)\n\t\t\tBiostatistics in Practice Project / MS Thesis Presentation\n\n\n\nSummer\n\n\nBSTA\n\n\nBSTA 8990: Pre Dissertation Lab Research\nOral Candidacy Examination\n\t\t\tPhD Thesis*\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nYear 3\n\n\nFall\n\n\nBSTA\n\n\nFT Courses:\nAdvanced Electives (3)\n\t\t\tBSTA 8990: Pre Dissertation Lab Research\nOral Candidacy Examination (if not completed in summer)\n\t\t\tPhD Dissertation\n\n\n\n\nSpring\n\n\nBSTA\n\n\nPhD Dissertation\n\n\n\n\nSummer\n\n\nBSTA\n\n\nPhD Dissertation\n\n\n\n\n \nYears 4-5\n\n\nFall\n\nBSTA\n\n \n\t\t\tPhD Dissertation\n\n\n\n \n*Teaching requirement; typically completed in years 2–5.\nClose",

Regarding Tutoring Students for Compensation\n[HEADING] Print Options\nThe Doctor of Philosophy degree is conferred in recognition of marked ability and high attainment in a specific branch of learning. The Ph.D. degree is granted by the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania upon the approval of the Graduate Council of the Faculties and upon satisfaction of all degree requirements, including acceptance of the dissertation by the student’s dissertation committee. Students may enroll in more than one academic Ph.D. program with prior permission of both Schools/programs; only one Ph.D. is earned.\nThe University’s standards, set forth below, are to be viewed as minimum requirements. The School or the Graduate Group has the right to establish additional requirements and to refuse to examine any student who is not qualified according to its standards. If there are additional program or School requirements, that information must be communicated and available to all students.\nGraduate Groups determine the curricular requirements for their programs. The course of study can include a combination of specific required courses, electives, teaching, independent study or laboratory rotations, colloquia, and demonstration through examination of comprehensive knowledge in the major field.\nA student who enters the Ph.D. program with a bachelors degree will be expected to spend two to three years taking 3-4 course units a semester before satisfying the Graduate Group’s academic requirements, passing the required examinations and being advanced to candidacy. Graduate Groups may require more extensive preparation through additional work, especially those programs with substantial language requirements.\nStudents in some programs, such as those in science fields, may begin dissertation-related research before advancing to candidacy. Students who enter with a master’s degree or other transfer credit may satisfy the formal course requirements more quickly. Graduate Groups have flexibility to establish the optimal timetable and requirements for their own students and to respond to the specific academic needs of individual students.\nThe customary maximum load for a Ph.D. student is four course units each semester; exceptions for a fifth course unit may be made in extraordinary cases upon approval of the graduate dean.\nGraduate Groups may establish examination requirements in addition to the University’s standards described below.\ni. Transfer Credit\nCredit may be transferred toward the Ph.D. from a master’s degree or other work completed in a post-baccalaureate degree program, upon recommendation by the Graduate Group Chair and approval of the graduate dean, reducing full tuition registration by up to two years. No work done as an undergraduate, whether at this institution or at any other, will be counted toward a Ph.D., A.M., or M.S., with the following exception: graduate courses completed by undergraduates as submatriculants in a Graduate Group may be counted toward graduate degree requirements.\nii. Auditors\nStudents who desire to attend a course without performing the work of the course must first secure the consent of the instructor. They must   register in order for the audited course to appear on the transcript; no credit will be received for the audited course. A teaching fellow registered for three course units may register as auditor for one additional course with permission of the Graduate Group Chair.\nA student may request that the School graduate office change their status in a course to auditor, provided that the request is endorsed by the chairperson of their Graduate Group and the instructor giving the course, and is submitted to the School graduate office no later than the end of the second week of the term.\nA Qualifications Evaluation of each student is required to be conducted in the first two years. The evaluation is designed by the Graduate Group and may be based on an examination or on a review of a student’s overall academic progress. Satisfaction of this requirement is necessary in order to continue in the graduate program and is recorded in the student’s academic record. The student and the School’s graduate office must be notified of the outcome of the evaluation.\nA Candidacy Examination on the major subject area is required. This examination is normally held after the candidate has completed all required courses and may be satisfied by the successful defense of a dissertation proposal. It may be oral, written, or both, at the discretion of the Graduate Group. Feedback will be provided to the student within one month. Satisfactory completion of the Candidacy Examination requirement is recorded in the student’s academic record. Upon successful completion of the Candidacy Examination, the student is advanced to candidacy. Normally, a student should advance to candidacy by the end of the third year. The maximum time limit for a student to be advanced to candidacy is five years, after which time the student will be dropped from the program.\nThe grading system is as follows:\nAt the graduate level, the grade of C, while passing, does not constitute satisfactory performance. Letter grades may be modified by a plus (+) or minus (-) sign at the discretion of the School. The minimum standard for satisfactory work for the Graduate Faculties is a B average in each academic year, but the Graduate Group may set additional requirements that determine advancement; these requirements may require a student to withdraw despite a satisfactory grade average, if the quality of the student’s work is not at a level that predicts successful dissertation research.\nThe mark of S is used to indicate “satisfactory progress.” The mark of U is used to indicate “unsatisfactory progress.” The mark of I is used to designate “incomplete.” Students who fail to complete a course and do not withdraw or change their status to auditor within the prescribed period shall receive at the instructor’s discretion either a grade of I (incomplete) or F (failure). It is expected, in general, that a student shall complete the work of a course during the term in which that course is taken. The instructor may permit an extension of time up to one year for the completion of the course. In such cases, any course which is still incomplete after one calendar year from its official ending must remain as “incomplete” on the student’s record and shall not be credited toward a degree.\nAll PhD students are required to write and deposit a dissertation consisting of original research.\ni. Format and Content of the Dissertation\nThe dissertation is, essentially, a manuscript. In some fields, the dissertation may consist of articles published by the student during the course of the Ph.D. program, accompanied by a narrative explaining the context and significance of the collected works. Essential supplementary mixed media files, such as photographs, audio recordings, musical compositions, and film may be submitted to augment the written text. Dissertations based on joint work with other researchers are allowed, provided that, in such cases, a unique and separate dissertation is presented by each degree candidate. The candidate must include a concise account of their contribution to the whole work. Authorship of an entire dissertation by more than one degree candidate is not allowed.\nii. Dissertation Committee Composition & Meetings\nUpon advancement to candidacy, each student has a dissertation committee consisting of at least three faculty members (including at least two members of the Graduate Group). At least half of the members of the dissertation committee must be members of the Graduate Group at the time of appointment to the committee. Faculty who are not members of the Graduate Group may serve as committee members only with the written approval of the Graduate Group. The authority to approve membership on committees may be delegated to the Graduate Group Chair. A Graduate Group may establish additional requirements, such as a requirement for outside reviewers on the dissertation committee.\nThe Chair of the Dissertation Committee must be a member of the Standing Faculty in the Graduate Group. If the Chair of a Dissertation Committee leaves the Standing Faculty before the dissertation is completed, then a new person from the Standing Faculty in the Graduate Group must be appointed as Chair. The Dissertation Committee Chair is responsible for convening committee meetings, advising the student on Graduate Group and University expectations, and assuring the Graduate Group Chair that the group’s requirements have been met.\nThe Dissertation Supervisor is the person primarily responsible for overseeing the student’s dissertation research. A student may have both a Dissertation Supervisor and a Dissertation Co-Supervisor, or two  Dissertation Co-Supervisors, if that responsibility is shared equally. The student and Dissertation Supervisor meet regularly (at least twice a year and, in many cases, much more frequently) to establish expectations and review the progress of the student’s research. The Dissertation Supervisor may serve as Chair of the Dissertation Committee, but is not required to do so.\nDissertation Supervisors, and Dissertation Co-Supervisors, must be members of the Standing Faculty at Penn, with special approved exceptions. A member of the Associated Faculty (such as Research Faculty or Adjunct Faculty) or a member of the Emeritus Faculty may be permitted to serve as a Dissertation Supervisor with prior approval of the Vice Provost for Education on a case by case basis. The Graduate Group Chair must petition the Vice Provost for Education, in advance, for an exception. In such cases, the Dissertation Supervisor is not permitted to serve as the Chair of the Dissertation Committee and a member of the Standing Faculty in the Graduate Group must be appointed as the Dissertation Committee Chair.\nThe dissertation committee meets at least once annually with the student to review the student’s progress. The student prepares an Annual Dissertation Progress Report and the committee gives timely feedback (within one month) and confirms whether progress is satisfactory. A copy of the signed progress report is submitted to the Dissertation Supervisor and Graduate Group Chair and is documented by the School in the student’s academic record. The committee feedback contributes to the determination of a mark of S (satisfactory progress) or U (unsatisfactory progress) to the student’s dissertation status course (see section I.d.iii.).\nStudents and Graduate Groups are encouraged to review Guidelines for Advising & Mentoring PhD Students.\niii. Dissertation Status\nAll students on dissertation status are registered for year-long dissertation status courses. These courses will receive a temporary mark of PR in the fall to indicate the course is in progress and a permanent mark of S (satisfactory progress) or U (unsatisfactory) at the end of the spring semester (or fall semester if that is the student’s last enrolled term). The mark will be a reflection of the evaluation by the Graduate Group of the student’s progress based, in part, on the student’s Annual Progress Report.\niv. Public Presentation & Defense\nA public, oral presentation of the dissertation is required. The presentation may take the form of a workshop based on a complete draft of the dissertation, or it may be based on the final version of the dissertation, depending on the rules of the Graduate Group. In either case, the presentation must either include or be followed by an oral examination (defense). This examination may be private if specified by the rules of the Graduate Group.\nAt least three members of the dissertation committee must participate in the defense. Defenses may be conducted in-person, virtually via video conferencing (e.g., Zoom, Skype, Microsoft Teams), or in a hybrid format with some individuals participating remotely and some in-person.\nv. Acceptance of the Dissertation\nBy the prescribed deadline on the Graduation Calendar, the Graduate Group shall report to the Office of the Provost the acceptance of the dissertation and its suitability for publication. The report shall include the date of the oral presentation or the date of the meeting of the dissertation committee, the names and roles of the dissertation committee members, and whether they individually approve the dissertation. The student and the Dissertation Supervisor will also have access to a copy of the report.\nvi. Publication & Submission\nDissertations must follow the format prescribed in the Dissertation Formatting Guide. Candidates also should familiarize themselves with any special requirements imposed by the Graduate Groups under which they are working.\nAll Penn Ph.D. dissertations are submitted electronically as of Spring 2020; hardcopies are not required. Since Fall 2015, Penn requires open access publication of dissertations in the institutional repository, ScholarlyCommons. All Ph.D. dissertations must be submitted in digital format through ProQuest’s ETD Administrator module.\nStudents should discuss with their advisor whether a delay in publication (embargo) is necessary or advisable. Students may apply for delay in publication by ProQuest and in ScholarlyCommons separately; the maximum allowed embargo period in ScholarlyCommons is a total of nine years from the graduation date. An initial three-year embargo period in ScholarlyCommons is approved automatically. A request for a delay of an additional three years requires approval by the Graduate Group Chair. In the event that a further delay is needed, the approval of the Graduate Group Chair and the School’s Graduate Dean is required.\nvii. Dissertation Copyright & Patent Policies\nA dissertation submitted as part of the requirements for a degree is the property of the University. Any copyrights or patent rights arising therefrom shall be governed by the policies of the University of Pennsylvania, including the Patent and Tangible Research Property Policies and Procedures and the Policy Relating to Copyrights and Commitment of Effort for Faculty. Information about securing copyright for a dissertation and using copyrighted or previously published materials in a dissertation is available online.\nAs of 2010-2011, the University’s maximum time limit for completion of a PhD program is ten years after matriculation; some Graduate Groups and Schools have established more stringent criteria. Graduate students who have been dropped after ten years may petition the Graduate Group to return as a student for a maximum of one year in order to achieve recertification and defend the dissertation. (See sections below on Petition for Readmission and Recertification.)\nCombined degree students (e.g., M.D.-Ph.D.s) typically enroll full-time in the professional program  during the first two years of study and do not begin full time Ph.D. course work until the third year; for these students, the ten- year time limit begins at the start of full-time Ph.D. study.\nA student who has been dropped after reaching the maximum time limit may petition the Graduate Group to return as a student for a maximum of one further year in order to achieve recertification and complete and defend the dissertation. Faculty members have no obligation to continue working with a student who has been dropped, nor is there any presumption that a Graduate Group will respond favorably to a petition for re-admission. If a Graduate Group wishes to recommend re-admission, it must present to the Graduate Dean a list of faculty members willing to serve as a dissertation committee and a detailed, realistic plan of how the student will, within one year of reenrollment, achieve recertification, pass the Candidacy Examination, and submit the final copy of the dissertation. If re-admission is approved by the Graduate Dean, the student must pay Reduced Tuition for two semesters, unless all requirements are completed within one semester. Students may petition for readmission at the time they are dropped from the program, or at a later date. The student should be fully ready and committed to completing within a one-year timeframe; enrollment will not be extended beyond that final year, and no further petition for readmission will be considered by the University.\nIf the Graduate Group and Graduate Dean approve the petition for readmission, the student must immediately be recertified. In order to ensure that a student’s dissertation research remains at the frontier of current research in the field, the student must retake and pass the Candidacy Examination, or satisfy alternative recertification criteria designed by their Graduate Group and approved by the Graduate Council of the Faculties. The new deadline for completion of all requirements for the Ph.D., including recertification, shall be within one year.\ni. Approved Individual Graduate Group Re-certification Policies\nThe following policies have been approved by the Graduate Council of the Faculties and supplement the University’s Recertification Policy.\nStudents who have not completed the dissertation within the University’s maximum time limit may apply for readmission, but must then complete all requirements for the Ph.D., including deposit of the dissertation, within one year. In order to reapply, the student should have a complete draft of their dissertation that has been approved by their advisor. At that point, the student should meet with the Graduate Group Chair, who will then bring the student’s case before the Graduate Group for a vote. Should the vote support the student’s readmission, the Graduate Group Chair will present the case to the Graduate Dean, outlining the student’s outstanding requirements and a timetable for completing them. In some cases, the student may be asked to repeat the Candidacy Examination in order to demonstrate a satisfactory grasp of current scholarship in the field. The Graduate Dean then reviews the case, and if it is approved, writes a letter formally spelling out the arrangements, and the tuition and fees that the student will be expected to pay\nStudents who have not completed all requirements for the Ph.D., including the deposit of the dissertation, within ten years of matriculating must submit all written work they have completed on their dissertation to a committee comprised of a minimum of three members of the Communications standing faculty. This committee may be the student’s dissertation committee or, if that committee is not intact, an Ad Hoc committee appointed by the Committee on Graduate Studies. The committee members will evaluate this material (they may, at their discretion, meet with the student), and take one of the following actions:\nIn the case of (1) or (2), above, the committee will report its decisions and actions to the Committee on Graduate Studies. Upon satisfactory re-certification, the student must complete all requirements for the Ph.D., including deposit of the dissertation, within one year.\nStudents who have not completed all requirements for the Ph.D., including the deposit of the dissertation, within the University’s maximum time limit must retake the dissertation prospectus exam (also known as the “final exam”). This exam will involve submitting an updated version of the prospectus to the student’s committee; the committee must approve the new prospectus in order for the student to satisfy the recertification requirement. Upon satisfactory re-certification, the student must complete all requirements for the Ph.D., including deposit of the dissertation, within one year.\nStudents who have not completed all requirements for the Ph.D., including the deposit of the dissertation, within the University’s maximum time limit retake the Dissertation Proposal Defense Exam; and write and submit a review of the most recent literature on the dissertation topic, to be formally approved by the dissertation committee (which also conducts the proposal defense). Upon satisfactory re-certification, the student must complete all requirements for the Ph.D., including deposit of the dissertation, within one year.\nPh.D. students in the Graduate Group in Education who have not completed all their degree requirements within the University’s maximum time limit must submit a progress report and plan to their dissertation committee. The purpose of this report/plan is:\nThe student’s chair and a majority of their dissertation committee must review and approve the progress report and plan. The student must then submit the progress report and plan to the Committee on Degrees for their review and approval. The student must re-take a preliminary exam that documents familiarity with the current status of their field.\nStudents who have not completed all requirements for the Ph.D., including the deposit of the dissertation, within the University’s maximum time limit must 1) submit an updated version of the prospectus and 2) submit a review of the most recent literature on the dissertation topic. The student’s committee must approve the new prospectus and review of literature in order for the student to satisfy the recertification requirement. Upon satisfactory re-certification, the student must complete all requirements for the Ph.D., including deposit of the dissertation, within one year.\nA student can be re-certified by submitting a revised dissertation proposal reflecting current scholarship on the topic and then undergoing a new dissertation proposal defense, following the usual procedures for the Graduate Group. Upon satisfactory re-certification, the student must complete all requirements for the Ph.D., including deposit of the dissertation, within one year or less as determined by the Graduate Group.\nFor Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations, students who apply to be re-enrolled in the Ph.D. program must pass a recertification examination demonstrating satisfactory grasp of current scholarship in their field. The Graduate Group Chair and the dissertation committee will constitute the recertification committee for this purpose. After an initial oral examination, the committee may, at its discretion, require that the student retake the Candidacy Examination and/or submit a revised dissertation proposal prior to recertification. Upon satisfactory re-certification, the student must complete all requirements for the Ph.D., including deposit of the dissertation, within one year.\nAll students who have not completed all requirements for the Ph.D. (including deposit of the dissertation) within the University’s maximum time limit must submit to their full dissertation committee (i.e., the supervisor and two readers) a copy of all written work they have completed on their dissertation. The committee members will evaluate this material, and report to the whole group, recommending that one of the following actions be taken: (1) The student is required to retake the qualifying examination (if the committee believes there is a question about the continued currency of the student’s research); or (2) The student is disqualified from continued doctoral candidacy (if the committee believes the written work provides insufficient evidence of progress toward the completion of an adequate doctoral dissertation). Other conditions are imposed on the student’s dissertation research, such as the committee believes will ensure the currency and timely completion of the student’s work toward the Ph.D. within one year of recertification.\nPh.D. students who have not completed all their degree requirements within the University’s maximum time limit may apply for recertification. The standards for granting an extension are:\nAn application for an extension consists of the following steps: The student meets with the Dissertation Chair about an extension and the Chair calls a meeting of the full dissertation committee. The dissertation committee hears a student presentation detailing work thus far on the dissertation and a plan for completion within one year. In addition to fielding questions about the dissertation work and the feasibility of the completion plan, the student may also be orally examined on the broader social welfare context of the dissertation work, to demonstrate currency in the field. The presentation is given in a closed meeting to dissertation committee members and steering committee members. The dissertation committee makes a recommendation to the doctoral program director on whether or not the student should be re-certified.\nUpon receiving the recommendation of the dissertation committee, the doctoral program director makes the final decision about whether or not the extension is granted. The doctoral program director will inform the student of a decision. Decisions to re-certify will be relayed to the University administration by the program director.\nBeginning in fall 2008, Ph.D. students will be charged full tuition until they have completed five years of full-time study or the equivalent of approximately 30 course units. The time may be as brief as three years if a student enters with credits from a post-baccalaureate degree program or successfully completes the Ph.D. in fewer than five years.\nIf the student has not earned the Ph.D. degree by the end of five years, the student will be charged reduced tuition until the degree is awarded, or for a maximum of five additional years. Continuous enrollment is required through year ten (or until graduation), with an exception for approved leave. After a maximum of five years at reduced tuition, the student ceases to be enrolled. With permission and re-certification from the Graduate Group, a student may re-enroll for a final year in order to defend and deposit the dissertation. Such a student must pay reduced rate tuition for a final two semesters, unless all requirements are completed within one semester.\nA student engaged in research overseas may be registered for Dissertation Abroad. Full tuition is charged to students in years 1-5, reduced tuition to students in years 6-10; a reduced general fee is charged for students on Dissertation Research Abroad regardless of their year.\nContinuous registration as a graduate student is required unless a formal leave of absence is granted by the Graduate Dean of the student’s School; see the PhD Student Leave of Absence Policy. A leave of absence will be granted for military duty, medical reasons, or family leave; this leave is typically for up to one year and “stops the clock” on time to completion. Personal leave for other reasons may be granted for up to one year with the approval of the Graduate Dean, but it does not automatically change the time limit. Leave should not be granted for the purpose of evading tuition charges. Additional requirements for return may be imposed by the Graduate Dean. No language or other degree examinations may be taken while a student is on leave of absence. A student without an approved leave of absence who fails to register each semester will be considered to have withdrawn from candidacy for the degree; approval by the Graduate Dean and recertification are required for reinstatement.\nDissertation registration takes place in the fall and spring semesters. Dissertation students who are candidates for August degree remain full- time students through August 31st without summer registration.\nA student who wishes to change their Graduate Group must submit an application for admission to the new Graduate Group.\nA student who will conduct dissertation research abroad for the semester registers for Dissertation Research Abroad status. Full tuition is charged to students in years 1-5, reduced tuition to students in years 6-10; a reduced general fee is charged for students on Dissertation Research Abroad regardless of their year.\nIf graduate credit is sought for research work pursued at laboratories not officially a part of the University of Pennsylvania (for example, where the investigator is not a member of the Graduate Group), the student must obtain prior permission from the Graduate Group Chair. University policies regarding intellectual property apply in the case of research conducted in extramural settings.\nThe Exchange Scholar Program allows University of Pennsylvania Ph.D. students to apply to study for a semester or academic year at one of ten other participating institutions:\nThrough cooperative arrangements with Bryn Mawr College, Haverford College, and Swarthmore College, University of Pennsylvania students may, upon presentation of the proper credentials and with the permission of the instructor concerned, enroll for courses in these institutions. The University of Pennsylvania will accept toward a master’s or Ph.D. degree up to the equivalent of three course units for work completed under this arrangement.\nThrough a cooperative arrangement between The Annenberg School for Communication and Johns Hopkins University, students selected as exchange scholars from the Annenberg School for Communication may count up to one academic year of study at John Hopkins (taken while registered at Penn), subject to the approval of the Graduate Group, toward the Ph.D. degree at the University of Pennsylvania.\nPh.D. and research master’s students enrolled in Anthropology or History of Art may, upon approval of their Graduate Group and the instructor, enroll for a maximum of two courses in the Department of Art Conservation at the University of Delaware. The University of Pennsylvania will accept credits completed under this agreement for a master’s or Ph.D. degree.\nPh.D. students enrolled in Ancient History, Classical Studies, Religious Studies, Germanic Languages, and History may, upon approval of their Graduate Group and the instructor at the host institution, enroll for a maximum of four courses for graduate credit at the Lutheran Theological Seminary at Philadelphia.\nPh.D. students enrolled for at least one full academic year in the Graduate Groups in Ancient History, Classical Studies, Art and Archaeology of the Mediterranean World, History of Art, Religious Studies, Germanic Languages, Political Science, or History may, subject to the approval of their Graduate Group and the instructor, enroll for a maximum of four courses at the Jewish Theological Seminary.\nEach year, up to two English Ph.D. students (one in film and one in poetics) may, upon approval of the Graduate Group and the instructor at the host institution, take one course each offered by Temple University’s Department of Film and Media Arts and in English.\nUnder the terms of the Ph.D. Student Exchange Program with Rutgers University, Ph.D. students in all fields may take up to four courses at Rutgers University upon approval of their Graduate Group chair.\nDetails regarding the institutional exchange agreements are available from the Office of the Vice Provost for Education.\nMany PhD programs have an academic requirement that students teach for one or more semesters. Teaching assistantships and teaching fellowships are done under the supervision of the faculty instructor. The Center for Teaching and Learning is a valuable resource for all graduate students interested in improving their professionalism as teachers – even those who do not have the opportunity to serve as a TA.\nA Teaching Assistant (or Teaching Fellow) shall not be allowed to tutor for compensation any student that they are grading or have influence in assessing.\n(Source: Almanac, July 5, 2022)\nPrint this page.\nThe PDF will include all information unique to this page.\n• Skip to Content\n• AZ Index\n• Catalog Home\n• Institution Home\n• Home/\n• Pennbook/\n• Academic Rules for PhD Programs\n• I.

The Director has responsibility for administrative oversight and academic leadership of the program. A job description for the BGS Director is here.\nThe mission of the Office of the Director of BGS is to oversee and administer all aspects of the training of PhD candidates in biomedical science and to assure the continued high quality of the student body and their training experience. The Office is responsible for the effective coordination and collaboration of the efforts of the several graduate groups in predoctoral training.\nEach graduate group appoints a chair, usually by an election of the group’s membership. In general, chairs hold renewable three-year terms. In addition to administering graduate group affairs, chairs serve on the Biomedical Advisory Committee (see below) and various ad-hoc BGS committees. At the University level, the duties and responsibilities of graduate group chairs are described in the University Faculty Handbook. The BGS graduate group chair job description is available here.  Some graduate groups appoint a vice chair to assist the chair.\nThe Biomedical Advisory Committee is advisory to the Director of BGS. It is chaired by the BGS Director and composed of the chairpersons of the BGS graduate groups. Additional faculty representing the Combined Degree Programs, and the University's Graduate Council of Facilities also serve. The committee meets monthly throughout the academic year to develop policies and consider program changes.\nThis committee consists of representatives from each graduate group. It meets approximately six times each year between January and March to review and rank all applicants who have been interviewed and nominated for acceptance by the BGS graduate groups.\nThe Biomedical Curriculum and Academic Standards Committee consists of a representative from each graduate group. It meets three times per year to monitor the quality of BGS courses, promote the development of new course offerings, and review the academic performance of students in the first two years of training.  Proposals for new courses are first developed and approved at the level of the graduate group and then submitted to BGS via a new course proposal form.\nThe Director of BGS reports to the Dean of the Perelman School of Medicine through the Executive Vice Dean and Chief Scientific Officer and to the Provost through the Vice Provost for Education.\nBGS is formally administered through the Perelman School of Medicine, which provides BGS with office space, an administrative budget, information technology support, and general oversight. BGS’ administrative budget covers most of the salaries of the BGS administrative staff and graduate group coordinators; salary supplements of the BGS Director and the graduate group chairs; graduate group recruitment costs; and general operating costs for the BGS and graduate group offices.\nThe Provost is the chief academic officer responsible to the President for the conduct, coordination and quality of the University's academic and research programs. The Vice Provost for Education oversees educational programs and University-wide educational policies that govern teachers and students at Penn. S/he chairs the Council of Undergraduate Deans, the Council of Graduate Deans, the Graduate Council of Faculties, and the Council of Professional Master's Degree Deans.\nThe Director of BGS serves on the Council of Graduate Deans, an advisory body to the Provost and Vice Provost for Education. The Council consists of the Graduate Deans of the nine schools offering the PhD and research masters degrees. The Graduate Deans provide advice on administrative matters affecting the larger University graduate student community, such as recruitment and retention.\nTwo members of the Biomedical Advisory Committee represent the BGS faculty on the Graduate Council of Faculties. The Graduate Council is an advisory body to the Provost and Vice Provost for Education and is chaired by the Vice Provost for Education. The Graduate Council assists in the evaluation of graduate programs by participating in or conducing periodic reviews; advises on policy matters related to the well-being of graduate education; and advises concerning University-wide admissions and degree requirements for the PhD, AM, and MS degrees. The Graduate Council also certifies for the Trustees the candidates for the award of those degrees.\n• Home\n• About\n• Academic Structure",

The ideal term project can potentially lead to a dissertation topic.\n• Fall term\n• 1.0 credit unit\n• Prerequisites: BSTA 621 and BSTA 622.  BSTA 622 can be taken concurrently.\nDescription: Selected topics from public health and biomedical research where \"Big data\" are being collected and methods are being developed and applied, together with some core statistical methods in high dimensional data analysis. Topics include dimension reduction, detection of novel association in large datasets, regularization and high dimensional regression, ensemble learning and prediction, kernel methods, deep learning and network analysis. R programs will be used throughout the course, other standalone programs will also be used.\n• Fall term\n• 1.0 credit unit\n• Prerequisites: BSTA 621, BSTA 622; permission of instructor.\nDescription: This course considers approaches to defining and estimating causal effects in various settings. The potential-outcomes approach provides the framework for the concepts of causality developed here, although we will briefly consider alternatives. Topics considered include: the definition of effects of scalar or point treatments; nonparametric bounds on effects; identifying assumptions and estimation in simple randomized trials and observational studies; alternative methods of inference and controlling confounding; propensity scores; sensitivity analysis for unmeasured confounding; graphical models; instrumental variables estimation; joint effects of multiple treatments; direct and indirect effects; intermediate variables and effect modification; randomized trials with simple noncompliance; principal stratification; effects of time-varying treatments; time-varying confounding in observational studies and randomized trials; nonparametric inference for joint effects of treatments; marginal structural models; and structural nested models.\n• Spring term\n• 0.5 credit unit\n• Prerequisites: permission of instructor;\nDescription: This seminar will be taken by doctoral candidates after the completion of most of their coursework. Topics in biostatistical methodology will vary from year to year. Methodology related to clinical trials, missing data, functional data analysis, generalized linear models, statistical genetics, advances in Bayesian methodology are examples of areas that may be covered.\n• Fall/Spring term\n• 0.5 credit unit\n• Prerequisites: permission of instructor;\n• Home\n• GGEB Courses\n• Fall 2025\n• Spring 2025\n• Fall 2024\n• Spring 2024\n• Fall 2023\n•

  \n\nBSTA 6100: Biostatistics for Epidemiologic Research\n• Fall term\n• 1 course unit\n•  Co-requisite: EPID 7010\nDescription: This one-semester course is designed to provide a strong foundation in biostatistical methods for epidemiologic research, intended for students entering a PhD program in epidemiology. Covered topics include introductory probability theory, estimands, large-sample theory, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, linear regression, generalized linear models, models for correlated data, and survival analysis, all with a throughline of likelihood-based inference. The course will consist of interactive lectures and labs designed to develop hands-on analytic skills. Prerequisite: Single variable calculus, Prior coursework in statistics at the undergraduate level\nEPID 7000: Doctoral Seminar in Epidemiology\n• Spring term\n• 1 course unit\n•  Prequisite: Instructor permission.\nThe course is intended to meet the needs of PhD students over the entire program from the coursework phase through the dissertation defense, and is intended to optimize cross-fertilization between the students at all phases of their program. Restricted to Epidemiology Doctoral Students. \nEPID 7010: Introduction to Epidemiologic Research\n• Fall term\n• 1 course unit\n•  Prequisite: Quantitative proficiency. Knowledge and/or experience in working in biomedical research.\nDescription: This course is intended to provide in-depth, exposure to the theory and methods of epidemiologic research. Topics to be covered include causal inference, measures of disease frequency andassociation, study design, bias and confounding, validity, and epidemiologic analysis.\nEPID 7020: Advanced Topics in Epidemiologic Research\n• Spring Term\n• 1 course unit\n• Prequisite: EPID 526/527 or equivalent; EPID 701; instructor permission\nDescription: The overarching goal of this course is to expose doctoral students in epidemiology to advanced epidemiologic and statistical research methods and theories that are limitedly or not otherwise covered in courses available in the curriculum. Topics that will be covered include reporting guidelines and best practices for reporting statistical methods and results, handling missing data, purposeful selection and application of propensity scores, selected topics in longitudinal and clustered data analysis, contemporary topics in statistical inference and use of pvalues and other Frequentist statistical methods, Bayesian theory and inference, and topics selected in collaboration with students and the Graduate Group in Epidemiology and Biostatistics (GGEB) each term. This course is intended for doctoral students in the PhD program in Epidemiology. However, students from other graduate groups are welcome, as long as they meet the prerequisites; such students are welcome during any year of study.\nEPID 7040: Methods for Social Epidemiologic Research\n• Spring Term\n• 1 course unit\n• Prequisite: Instructor permission\nDescription:  Epidemiology is fundamentally an applied social science, where we develop and apply quantitative and qualitative methods to characterize health-related exposures and outcomes in populations. Social epidemiology, as one branch of the field, seeks to leverage the social sciences to extend those characterizations to include social, behavioral, and environmental factors to more fully understand the social determinants of those exposures and outcomes, and to identify and evaluate interventions to reduce health disparities. This course is intended to provide students in epidemiology, biostatistics, and other disciplines with an in-depth introduction to the principles and methods of social epidemiology.\nEPID 7050: Nutritional Epidemiology\n• Spring Term\n• 1 course unit\n• Prequisite: EPID 7010, EPID 5100, PUBH502, or equivalent; permission of course director. \nDescription: This course introduces students to key concepts and methods in Nutritional Epidemiology to equip them with the tools needed to design, analyze, and critically evaluate population-based nutrition research. The course also reviews several specific diet/disease relationships, integrating information from secular trends, cohort studies, clinical trials, and animal experiments. Knowledge in nutrition is useful but not required. Prerequisites include introductory epidemiology.\nEPID 7110: Environmental Epidemiology\n• Spring Term\n• 1 course unit\n• Prequisite: instructor permission\nDescription: Environmental Epidemiology is an advanced epidemiology course that addresses epidemiological research methods used to study environmental exposures from air pollution to heavy metals, and from industrial pollutants to consumer product chemicals. The course will provide an overview of major study designs in environmental epidemiology, including cohort studies, panel studies, natural experiments, randomized controlled trials, time-series, and case-crossover studies. The course will discuss disease outcomes related to environmental exposures, including cancer and diseases of cardiovascular, respiratory, urinary, reproductive, and nervous systems. Case studies in environmental epidemiology will be discussed to provide details of research methods and findings. \nEPID 7012:  Nutritional Epidemiology\n\nSpring Term\n1 course unit\n\nDescription: This course introduces students to key concepts and methods in Nutritional Epidemiology to equip them with the tools needed to design, analyze, and critically evaluate population-based nutrition research. The course also reviews several specific diet/disease relationships, integrating information from secular trends, cohort studies, clinical trials, and animal experiments. Knowledge in nutrition is useful but not required. \nEPID 7013:  Epidemiology of Substance Use and Related Complex Health Behaviors\n\nSpring Term\n1 course unit\n\nDescription: The course presents an overview of the epidemiology of substance use and related complex health behaviors within a public health framework. Students will explore a range of contributors to substance use, considering mechanisms ranging from biological to societal/structural. The course will introduce the historical background of the “war on drugs” and racial underpinnings of policies towards substance use;mental health definitions of addiction; substance use prevention strategies; substance use policies and their impacts; intervention and treatment approaches; barriers to treatment access and adherence; and structural risk factors for substance use and related problems. Students will critically evaluate methods for studying hidden and hard-to-reach populations—including sources of bias, measurement issues, and ethical considerations—as well as explore new and emerging innovations in studying substance use. We will also discuss the application of cross-cutting methods to the study of substance use (e.g., population surveillance and surveys, case-control studies, quasi-experimental designs such as difference-in-difference, mixed/qualitative methods).\nMore Course Descriptions for Epidemiology\nClose\nCourse Schedule\n        \n\n\n\n\nSpring 2025\nFall 2025\n\n\nSpring 2024\nFall 2024\n\n\nSpring 2023\nFall 2023\n\n\nSpring 2022\nFall 2022\n\n\nSpring 2021\nFall 2021\n\n\n\nSpring 2020\n\n\nFall 2020\n\n\n\nSpring 2019\nFall 2018\n\n\n\n \nBiostatisticsCourse Schedule: Fall 2025\n\nFirst day of classes: Tuesday, August 26 \nLabor Day (no classes): September 1\nFall Term Break: October 9-12 (observance up to GGEB instructors)\nThursday-Friday class schedule on Tuesday-Wednesday: November 25-26\nThanksgiving Break: November 27- 30\nLast day of classes: December 8\nReading Days: December 9-10 \nFinal Examinations: December 11-18\nFall Term Ends: December 18\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse #\n\nSection\nTitle\nInstructor\nDays\nTime\nCourse Dates\nLocation\n\n\nBSTA 5110\n001\nBiostatistics in Practice \nMary Putt\nT/H\n10:15-11:45\n \n \n\n\nBSTA 6200\n001\nProbability I\nHonghze Li\nM/W\n10:15-11:45\n \n \n\n\nBSTA 6220\n001\nStatistical Inference II\nA.

Teaching opportunities are announced by email.\nStudents may not accept TA ships without prior approval of their thesis advisor (if applicable) and graduate group chair. Effort should not exceed 10hrs/week. If a student is conducting a full-semester TA ship or other job that requires 100+ hours of service, approval of the BGS Director is required as well. In addition, students may serve as TAs or conduct other approved tasks for a maximum of two semesters only. (Exceptions may be made at the discretion of the thesis advisor and graduate group chair for students conducting short term or otherwise limited service, such as tutoring.) Students who wish to participate in a 3rd semester of teaching for the CETLI certificate program or a 3rd semester of supplemental activity for the PCI fellows program may do so with the permission of mentor and graduate group chair.
