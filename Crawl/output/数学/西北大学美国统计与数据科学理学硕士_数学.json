MS students have the option to take the qualifying Exam at the PhD level. However, passing the exam at the PhD level does not mean that an MS student will be admitted to the PhD program.\nDoing a thesis is provided as an option for students who desire to enhance their research experience by working with a thesis advisor on cutting-edge topics.  Starting the second quarter of the first year of study, students who are interested in the thesis track will be encouraged to approach faculty advisors and identify one as a thesis advisor. Once the thesis advisor is chosen, a thesis committee will be formed for each student, consisting of the thesis advisor, and two other faculty advisor members. The thesis committee must be formed not later than the end of Fall quarter of the second year. The thesis advisor will guide the student in thesis research, and course registration until completion. Students need to write a thesis and do a 30-min public presentation.\nBoth tracks require a minimum of 4 quarters of residency (not including summer), while students on thesis track may need 5-6 quarters or longer to complete their degree.

We study these representative intent channels and contribute a targeted method for each, tightening the full pipeline from goal grounding to action realization. First, Cold Diffusion on the Replay Buffer introduces a novel use of diffusion models for imitation learning by constraining generation to a robot’s own replay buffer of feasible states. This enables the synthesis of trajectories that are not only smooth and goal-directed, but also physically valid and deployable in constrained environments. Second, Wonderful Team tackles language-conditioned tasks with the first vision-language multi-agent framework that jointly grounds, plans, and verifies instructions. Its specialized agents iteratively refine each other’s outputs, enabling robust, zero-shot execution of long-horizon, multimodal commands—without fine-tuning or reliance on external perception modules. Finally, we present a hybrid reactive–semantic architecture that enables real-time control in dynamic environments by decoupling fast reinforcement-learning-based actions from asynchronous semantic reasoning via large language models. Unlike monolithic or purely reasoning-based systems, this approach maintains persistent semantic state and injects high-level guidance without blocking real-time execution. Individually, each contribution addresses a core challenge in intent-aware robotics; collectively, they illustrate the diverse algorithmic pathways toward systems that interpret and act on human goals in complex, evolving environments.\nDate: Friday, May 2, 2025Time: 3:00pmLocation:  Ruan Conference Room – lower level (Chambers Hall 600 Foster Street)Hybrid talk, register here to attend online\nSpeaker: Tiffany Christian, PhD candidate\nAbstract: The Standardized Vapor Pressure Deficit Drought Index (SVDI) is a new drought index introduced in 2022 that holds a wealth of information for detecting and describing drought events. In this talk, we introduce three complementary research approaches to study a long-term SVDI dataset from 1980-2021 in the continental USA. We develop a new unsupervised machine learning clustering algorithm that creates 3D spatio-temporal drought clusters. The resulting clusters align with historical drought events and confirm long-term trends in drought severity and duration. We then apply a nonstationary Gaussian Process (GP) model to the data to uncover the spatial structure in the associated covariance function parameters and we present a new hierarchical model capable of modeling this higher level covariance function parameter structure. A comparative analysis of three different nonstationary GP methods is conducted to investigate the modeling accuracy of the covariance structure for a subset of the SVDI data.\nDate: Tuesday, May 6, 2025Time: 12:15pmLocation:  2006 Sheridan Rd, room B02\nSpeaker: Brody Kendall, PhD candidate\nAbstract: Loop-seq is a pioneering high-throughput assay that enables the simultaneous quantification of intrinsic cyclizability across a large set of DNA fragments. However, the assay's reliance on biotin-tethered elongated DNA fragments introduces a tethering effect, leading to biased cyclizability measurements. We demonstrate that the current de-biasing technique is inadequate for fully mitigating this bias. To address this, we introduce DNAcycP2, an enhanced software tool that extends the capabilities of its previous platform DNAcycP. DNAcycP2 incorporates a novel data augmentation approach to more effectively eliminate biotin tether bias, yielding more accurate estimates of intrinsic DNA cyclizability. Additionally, DNAcycP2 offers improved computational efficiency and expands accessibility through a newly developed R package alongside its existing Python package and web server, ensuring broader utility for the research community.\nWe also develop an application of DNAcycP2 predictions, namely, to develop features and analyze the relationship between intrinsic cyclizability and CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing efficiency. Specifically, we uncover a notable relationship between the predicted cyclizability of regions of the lentiviral delivery vector for the CRISPR-Cas9 system and its cleavage efficiency. Through exploratory analysis, hyperparameter optimization, feature selection, and final model construction on two distinct datasets, we investigate this relationship and conclude that it is dependent on the choice of promoter.\nDate: Monday, March 10, 2025Time: 10:00amLocation:  Ruan Conference Room – lower level (Chambers Hall 600 Foster Street)\nSpeaker: Kayla Schroeder, PhD candidate\nAbstract: Text data, while abundant, presents significant challenges for Natural Language Processing (NLP) due to its complexity and high dimensionality. The inherent variability in many NLP models, especially topic models and large language models (LLMs), necessitates robust reliability evaluations to ensure the trustworthiness of model outputs. Furthermore, inferring causal relationships between text and outcomes is complex, yet often done implicitly without proper consideration. This work aims to strengthen conclusions derived from NLP models by developing reliability metrics for topic models (e.g., LDA) and LLMs, and establishing a framework for causal inference with text as treatment. We introduce new reliability methods for topic models, demonstrating the shortcomings of existing approaches. For LLMs, we propose a reliability framework, highlighting the need for multiple instantiations to mitigate the impact of fixed randomness. Finally, we present a new causal dimension reduction method for text using semiparametric methods and topic models. This combined framework improves prediction and interpretability of textual treatments. This research contributes to more robust NLP applications, enabling more confident conclusions from text data.\nDate: Thursday, January 16, 2025Time: 1:00pmLocation: Online - reistration required (link below)\nSpeaker: Zheng Yuan, PhD candidate\nAbstract: In data mining, when binary prediction rules are used to predict a binary outcome, many performance measures are used in a vast array of literature for the purposes of evaluation and comparison. Typically, these performance measures are only approximately estimated from a finite dataset, which may lead to findings that are not statistically significant. In order to properly quantify such statistical uncertainty, it is important to provide confidence intervals associated with these estimated performance measures. In this talk, we introduce statistical inference about general performance measures used in data mining, with both individual and joint confidence intervals. Based on asymptomatic normal approximations, these confidence intervals can be computed fast, without needs to do bootstrap resampling. One of the applications of our framework is allowing multiple performance measures of multiple classification rules to be inferred simultaneously for comparisons.\nRegister here\nDate: Thursday, July 25, 2024Time: 1:00pmLocation: Harris Hall room L28\nSpeaker: Jingyang (Judy) Zhang, PhD candidate\nAbstract: Whenever an intervention is proposed, people want to know if it works. Quantifying and summarizing treatment effects has been a focus in fields such as public policy, business, and medicine. Current practices emphasize finding “the” treatment effect, assumed to be shared by all individuals. For a continuous outcome, individual treatment effects are summarized using the standardized mean difference, an effect size comparing the mean outcomes of the treatment group to those of the control group.\nIn theory, the standardized mean difference can sufficiently summarize individual treatment effects if the variations among those effects are small and completely due to sampling error. However, individuals often respond to an intervention differently because of differences in their characteristics. The standardized mean difference alone does not reflect this heterogeneity in individual effects. Furthermore, some ad hoc alternative effect sizes, such as the robust standardized mean difference, fail to fully account for the heterogeneity in treatment effects, leaving the problem of better summarizing heterogeneous effects unsolved.\nMy dissertation focuses on developing a novel approach that better summarizes treatment effects by providing effect size parameters that characterize the probability distribution associated with the treatment effect. Additionally, I explore the relationship between treatment effects and baseline outcomes to characterize interventions as either inequality-increasing or decreasing.\nI demonstrate how these novel effect size parameters can be estimated and derive the sampling properties of the corresponding estimators. The proposed methods are applied to empirical data, including studies from the What Works Clearinghouse, the National Study of Learning Mindsets, and a meta-analysis on the effect of school-based programs on cyberbullying perpetration and victimization. These examples reveal results that current practices would likely overlook, highlighting the additional insights provided by the proposed methods. The goal of my dissertation is to enhance research on variations in treatment effects, ultimately enabling more effective implementation of interventions.\nDate: Friday, November 10, 2023Time: 4:15pm-5:15pmLocation: University Hall 102\nSpeaker: Tim Tsz-Kit Lau, PhD candidate\nAbstract: Optimization and sampling are two main pillars of modern high-dimensional statistics and machine learning, and more broadly, data science. Optimization theory and algorithms have been heavily involved in the development of numerical solvers for high-dimensional statistical estimation problems under the frequentist paradigm as well as the success of deep learning, whereas efficient sampling procedures have been the major workhorse of Bayesian inference and uncertainty quantification. Leveraging the recently revived and intriguing connection between optimization and sampling, I study the theoretical underpinning in their interplay, and develop novel algorithms for applications to statistics and machine learning. In particular, I address two intrinsic issues arising in both high-dimensional statistical estimation and sampling problems—\"nonsmoothness'' and \"nonconvexity'', which are exacerbated by the notoriously inevitable \"curse of dimensionality'' brought by massive datasets and gigantic models, employing tools from convex optimization and diffusion processes. Finally, I also explore the use of deep learning to develop novel estimation procedures for various high-dimensional regularized M-estimation problems.\n• Home\n• Events\n• Dissertation Defense Talks",

      "content": "[HEADING] Graduate Programs Overview\nDepartment of Statistics and Data Science Graduate Programs Overview\nThe Department of Statistics and Data Science at Northwestern University offers a standalone program leading to the Doctor of Philosophy degree (PhD), a terminal Master of Science (MS) in Statistics, and a non-terminal Ad Hoc Master of Science (MS) in Applied Statistics for Northwestern graduate students enrolled in PhD programs in other departments at the University.\nBoth the doctoral and terminal MS programs robust and demanding curricula meticulously crafted to provide students with a comprehensive training in theory, methodology and applications of statistics and data science. The PhD program prioritizes the cultivation of skills necessary for successful careers as university educators, researchers, as well as research statisticians or data scientists in industry, government, and the non-profit sector. In contrast, the MS program aims to train students for a career as a professional statistician or data scientist in industry, government, and the non-profit sector, or for pursuing doctoral studies in statistics, data science, or related disciplines.\nThe non-terminal Ad Hoc MS in Applied Statistics program presents more flexibility for PhD students in other programs at NU to personalize their MS curriculum in applied statistics and data science to maximize the benefits for their PhD research and future career prospects.\nThe department is distinguished by faculty’s profound interest in theory and methodology in statistics and data science, along with their practical applications across a diverse array of domains including public policy, law, medicine and life sciences, engineering, and social sciences. Interest in cross-disciplinary work has always been strong - when the department was formed, in the 1980s, all the founding members of the department had appointments in other departments including from management, engineering, mathematics, education and social policy, sociology, and psychology.\nIn the recent years the Department has experienced substantial growth in both faculty team and educational programs with a particular focus on data science. The Department now has 21 faculty members among which 17 are tenured or on tenure-track and 5 on teaching-track. The department now offers a significantly enriched selection of graduate courses, covering a wide spectrum that encompasses classic statistics theory and methodology, advanced inference methods, and cutting-edge data science and machine learning techniques.\nFinancial aid in the form of teaching assistantships, research assistantships, and fellowships is widely available for well-qualified students in the PhD program. Financial aid is typically not available for master's degree students.\nThe Department of Statistics and Data Science is located on Northwestern University's 240-acre campus in Evanston, 12 miles north of downtown Chicago. Northwestern, a private university, is one of the nation's outstanding educational and research institutions. With its quiet suburban setting and proximity to the scientific and cultural activities of Chicago, Northwestern is an excellent environment for the student and scholar.\nDirector of Graduate Studies: Beth Andrews, bandrews@northwestern.edu\nDirector of MS in Statistics: Hongmei Jiang, hongmei@northwestern.edu\nDirector of Ad Hoc MS in Applied Statistics: Elizabeth Tipton, tipton@northwestern.edu\n• Home\n• Graduate\n• Graduate Programs Overview",

Almost every government agency needs qualified, capable statisticians. Statisticians work in many key government roles. They design the surveys and tests (such as the Census) which are used to gather data for government use, and they analyze the results of these tests to find useful statistics, such as the unemployment rate. They also help develop forecasts and models for scientific research and policy making, such as modeling the spread of disease or the effects of climate change.\nStatisticians in the federal government can find many opportunities at agencies such as:\nBeyond this, there are many opportunities for statisticians in state and local governments.\nStatisticians play a prominent role in the healthcare industry. They collect and maintain public health statistics and conduct studies and clinical trials examining the effects of different medicines and behaviors. Statisticians in healthcare can work in both the public and private sectors to promote responsible policymaking and healthy lifestyles.\nStatisticians in the healthcare industry can find employment at organizations such as:\nBusinesses usually place a high priority on making sure they operate as efficiently as possible. In order to do this they need to constantly gather data throughout their supply chains and analyze it to find out what parts work well and what parts need improvement. Firms often turn to statisticians for this type of data collection and analysis.\nStatisticians in operations management can find employment at organizations such as:\nStatisticians have many different roles in the information technology industry. One of the most crucial and visible of these is analyzing user data for social media and computing firms. Statisticians work at major tech companies such as Google, Facebook, and Apple, sifting through vast amounts of data to find patterns which can be used to improve the quality of the firm’s services. For instance, statisticians at Amazon might analyze demand for different products in different parts of the world. Using that data, they could find which products sell better in which regions. The company could then send more of these products to the delivery warehouses servicing each particular region, improving delivery times.\nStatisticians in the information technology industry can find employment at organizations such as:\nBefore any drug, food, or medical device is introduced to the mass market in the US, it must be thoroughly tested and evaluated for performance in different scenarios. Extensive clinical testing must be performed to determine the risks and side effects associated with using the product. Statisticians are frequently involved in these tests, analyzing the data and sometimes conducting the tests themselves. Their work often performs a critical role in the risk assessment of biotechnology products.\nStatisticians in the biotechnology and pharmaceuticals industry can find employment at organizations such as:\nThe modern banking and finance industries are built on investments and the trading of financial instruments, such as mortgages and other loans. Trades are often very intricate with many moving parts, and many financial institutions possess very large numbers of these complicated assets. Statisticians are needed to keep track of assets and develop forecasts regarding the returns on different investments and trades.\nStatisticians in the finance industry can find employment at organizations such as:\nFor an example of the power of statistics in modern-day major-league sports, look no further than the 2011 film “Moneyball.” In the film, the manager of a failing baseball team hires a statistician to help improve the team on a budget. Insights from the statistician allow the manager to draft newer, higher-quality players and create a better lineup. Thanks to these insights, the team wins 19 consecutive games, tying for the longest winning streak in American history. While this is a dramatization, it is reflective of real-life sports. Statisticians work all throughout the industry, improving lineups and trades by analyzing data from different teams and team members.\nStatisticians in the sports industry can find employment at organizations such as:\nInsurance carriers frequently determine the price of insurance coverage based on assessed risk – that is, how likely it is that an insured person or object will be damaged.

The program is flexible and may be arranged to reflect students' interests and career goals. Cross-disciplinary work is encouraged. The PhD program prepares students for careers as university teachers and researchers as well as research statisticians and data scientists in industry, government and the non-profit sector.\nStudents are required to fulfill the Department requirements in addition to those specified by The Graduate School (TGS).\nFrom the Graduate School’s webpage outlining the general requirements for a PhD:\nIn order to receive a doctoral degree, students must:\nPhD degrees must be approved by the student's academic program. Consult with your program directly regarding specific degree requirements.\nThe Department requires that students in the Statistics and Data Science PhD program:\nStudents generally complete the required coursework during their first two years in the PhD program.*note that required courses changed in the 2021-22 academic year, previous required courses can be found at the end of this page.\nPass the Prospectus presentation/examination and be admitted for PhD candidacy by the end of year 3. The department requires that students must complete their Prospectus (proposal of dissertation topic) before the end of year 3, which is earlier than The Graduate School deadline of the end of year 4. The prospectus must be approved by a faculty committee comprised of a committee chair and a minimum of 2 other faculty members. Students usually first find an adviser through independent studies who will then typically serve as the committee chair. When necessary, exceptions may be made upon the approval of the committee chair and the director of graduate studies, to extend the due date of the prospectus exam until the end of year 4.\nStudents admitted to the Statistics and Data Science PhD program can obtain an optional MS (Master of Science) degree en route to their PhD.
