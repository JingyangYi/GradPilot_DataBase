The program aims at training students with some science or engineering background who would like to prepare themselves for careers that require modeling skills based on information extracted from data. This program aims at training graduates to have strong skills in problem solving and logical thinking. These skills are essential for them to become competent in the data science sector. They will be trained to have hands-on experience in analyzing large amount of data, extract significant features from them, and hence provide valuable insights to understand complex situations and facilitate smart decision making for businesses, industries and services.\nThe Master of Science (MSc) Program in Physics is offered by the Department of Physics. The program focuses on scientific computing, and advanced materials physics and technology. We aim to upgrade and strengthen students’ knowledge in core areas of physics; and with various elective courses students can choose to specialize in a particular physics area. Students will gain knowledge of advanced materials for applications in next generation devices, and/or hands-on experience of learning various simulation and programming tools to solve physics and real-world problems. The overall aim is to enhance one’s fundamental knowledge in physics, promote critical thinking, problem solving and presentation skills. These important transferable skills are much ought-after by industry and commerce.

While each application is determined on its individual merits, an applicant should meet normal immigration requirements (such as holding a valid travel document with adequate returnability to his/her country of residence or citizenship; be of clear criminal record and raise no security or criminal concerns to the HKSAR; have no likelihood of becoming a burden on the HKSAR, etc.) as well as the relevant specific eligibility criteria detailed above before he/she may be considered for the grant of a visa/entry permit.
