If the document is required for your application, you need to apply for a VPD via uni-assist as well as apply to TUM directly via TUMonline.\nAn application for a VPD via uni-assist alone does not qualify as an application for a degree program at TUM. An application via TUMonline is always necessary.\nUni-assist performs preliminary processing and evaluation of the applicant's university entrance qualification (for bachelor's) or master qualification materials (for master's), running a check of the applicants’ certificates to determine which grades they have on the German grading system. This preliminary documentation (VPD) informs applicants whether they qualify to study all subjects (general qualification), only certain subjects (subject-restricted qualification) or postgradual studies (master's).\nIn addition, the VPD contains a conversion of all your credits and grades into the German grading system or the ECTS grading system.\nCheck the visa regulations that apply to you – and be sure to contact the German embassy in your country well in advance. If you do need a visa, you can now plan your application free of charge using the VisaFlow app. Just use the code “TUM25”. Please note that VisaFlow is an external service provider.

From this guide, the respective module content and the skills taught must emerge. For the verification of your qualification it must be clear what skills you have acquired in the relevant subjects. A transcript with lecture titles only is not enough! The course guide must be written in English or German.\nIf your university does not provide an official course guide in English or German, please submit a written confirmation to this fact. In that case we propose that you compile the contents of all relevant courses. Do you have lecture scripts from your professors? A copy of a detailed table of contents would be good. Often there are official descriptions of lectures on the university's website. If so, please give us a list of links.\nIf your course guide is only available in a language other than German or English, please attach the original guide as a pdf file or the links to the online version.
