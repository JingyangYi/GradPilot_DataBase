We will let you know by email as soon as we receive your application.\nThe application deadline is June 15th in every year for the class starting in October. You can apply at any point before that deadline.\nPlease refrain from using staples, paper clips, or folders for your application documents as they complicate the further processing of your application. Some documents come stapled (e.g. certified copies or translations), you can leave those as they are but please do not add extra staples that interfere with the document feeder of our scanner/copier.\nThe application deadline for the course starting in fall is (expected to be) June 15th in every year.\nSend your application to\nElitemasterprogam TMPz. Hd. Robert HellingLehrstuhl LuestDept. f. PhysikLMU MuenchenTheresienstr. 3980333 MuenchenGermany\nIn 2025/2026 at this first stage of the application process, you can apply electronically by sending your application as a single PDF file by email to tmp-coordinator@physik.lmu.de . When compiling the PDF file, you can help us by concatening the files in the order as in the list above.\nUpon acceptance, you will later have to present originals/certified copies. The letter of recommendation has be sent separately to tmp-coordinator@physik.lmu.de directly from your referee.\nPromising applicants will be invited to an interview after which the final decision about admission will be made. This interview can be waived for applicants with exceptionally good grades.\nImportant note:\nPlease be aware that the TMP master program shares many of its classes with the MSc programs in physics and mathematics. While applying to TMP you might also consider applying to the other programs (both at LMU and TUM) as well as those have different requirements for admission (in particular they do not require strong backgrounds in both physics and mathematics). Application to the other programs  does not affect your chances to be admitted to TMP. If you are interested in those programs you have to send separate applications as descibed on the respective web pages.\nThe formal requirement to enrol in a graduate program leading to a master's degree is a bachelor's degree. We understand that students enrolled in a program leading to a Diplom do not have a bachelor's degree. Thus, for a transitional period, students with a Vordiplom in physics or mathematics (and preferably two more semesters of the Diplomstudiengang) can enrol in the graduate program \"Theoretical and Mathematical Physics\" under the condition that they complete their bachelor's degree within the first year. The detailed procedure for this is currently being worked out.\nPlease feel free to contact us if you have any questions!\nWe intend to digitally sign important emails sent our by us.
