Program\n[HEADING] Contacts\nSelecting a site will automatically redirect you to the site's homepage.\nMany students complete the M.Eng. program in just two semesters. Instead of a research thesis, the degree requires an engineering design project. The program offers specializations that are highly sought after in today’s data-focused job market.\nDepending on the student’s undergraduate degree and intended M.Eng. concentration, a third semester may be required. Notably, ORIE’s M.Eng. Financial Engineering Concentration is designed as a three-semester program and includes a semester at Cornell Financial Engineering Manhattan. Most program concentrations require participation in activities that take place during the winter intersession and/or in August before the formal start of the fall semester.\nThe Ithaca Campus program offers 7 concentration areas, including the Financial Engineering concentration, which is designed as a 3 semester program.\nCornell Tech’s Master’s in Operations Research and Information Engineering will provide you with the mathematical modeling, large-scale computation and data analytics skills you need to turn heaps of data into effective business decisions.\nYou can choose one of the following seven areas as a concentration:\nApplied Operations Research\nData Analytics\nFinancial Engineering\nInformation Technology\nManufacturing and Industrial Engineering\nStrategic Operation\nSystems Engineering Minor\nRhodes Hall, Room 206\nCornell University\nIthaca, NY 14853\n607-255-4856\norie@cornell.edu\nM.Eng.

Our school is highly respected for work that influences and seeds ideas in the academic community to reach new understanding. Our core strength is our faculty; they are distinguished teachers and researchers who build breadth and depth in fundamental science and methodological research. Our reputation is demonstrated through faculty and student awards, journal publications, and textbook authorship.\nOur students and graduates are leaders, advancing and influencing decision and management sciences. They’ve received fellowships from the National Science Foundation, Department of Energy, Department of Defense, and the National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada, and have won awards like the SIAM Student Paper Prize, MSOM Student Paper Award, and the INFORMS/IIE Student Chapter Outstanding Teaching Assistant Awards, among others.\n“The faculty in the ORIE department are friendly and accessible. Through my Ph.D., I’ve had the opportunity to work with excellent colleagues, and the collaborative research experiences helped me expand my expertise. The uniquely interdisciplinary program helped me understand a wide variety of topics from optimization to statistics and probability.”\nOur program emphasizes operations research as a mathematical science. As a doctoral student in operations research, you’ll participate in a rigorous intellectual program that demands independent investigation and achievement and characterized by original scholarly work of the highest caliber. You’ll work closely with faculty in the school, college and across Cornell to build a strong analytical foundation for advanced research in theory, methodology, and new applications.\nDoctoral research is sponsored by industrial partners like IBM, General Motors, Sunoco, Amazon, and others. Our graduates go on to teach at top schools such as MIT, the University of Texas-Austin, the University of Wisconsin School of Business, and Princeton.\nPh.D. candidates pursue focused and specialized interests in one of three areas of concentrations\nRhodes Hall, Room 206\nCornell University\nIthaca, NY 14853\n607-255-4856\norie@cornell.edu\nRhodes Hall, Room 279\nIthaca, NY 14853\n607-254-3247\nORIE-PhD@cornell.edu\n• Schools and Departments\n• Undergraduate Majors and Minors\n• Faculty and Staff Directory\n• Applied Probability and Statistics\n• Manufacturing Systems Engineering\n• Mathematical Programming\n• General\n                        \n\nRhodes Hall, Room 206\nCornell University\nIthaca, NY 14853\n607-255-4856\norie@cornell.edu\n• Ph.D. Program\n                        \n\nRhodes Hall, Room 279\nIthaca, NY 14853\n607-254-3247\nORIE-PhD@cornell.edu\n[GRID_TABLE]\nSchools and Departments\nUndergraduate Majors and Minors\nFaculty and Staff Directory\n“The faculty in the ORIE department are friendly and accessible.
