We do not accept undergraduate degrees that are equivalent to three years of study. However, degrees that are completed within the Bologna signatory system that are Bachelor of Engineering (or a related field), and earn 180+ ECTS credits, are eligible for consideration. The minimum GPA requirement is a 3.0 out of a 4.0 scale.\nAttention will be given to programs accredited/approved by ABET and other regional accrediting associations. Please be advised that admission to a program different from your undergraduate field of study may require the completion of prerequisite courses before you will be permitted to begin graduate-level coursework. The NYU Tandon School of Engineering reserves the right to investigate or disqualify educational credentials on a case-by-case basis.\nTo ensure the most efficient application processing, submit your application before sending documents or submitting test scores.\nNYU Tandon School of Engineering\nGraduate Admissions Processing Center\n458 Pike Road\nHuntingdon Valley, PA 19006\n*For all application documents. Note that this is our document processing center in Pennsylvania.\nThe requirements below are for all applicants except Cyber Fellows; Refer to Cyber Fellows application requirements.\nThe Office of Graduate Admissions requires all applicants to complete the online application and does not accept paper-based applications. The application must be completed and submitted on or before the posted deadline for the term of entry.\nOnce you have completed all sections of the online application, validate and submit it. After submission, you will not be able to make changes to your application information. Once submitted, we are unable to return your application materials or documents. If you wish to submit updated documentation, please email us so we can advise on the best way to submit it.\nIn some cases, the academic department may contact the applicant for an interview.\nThe non-refundable application fee is $90 and is payable online by major credit card. We do not offer refunds for the application fee so please do not pay the fee more than once per application. If you are having problems submitting your payment via credit card, contact the Office of Graduate Enrollment Management and Admissions. If paying the application fee poses a financial hardship for you, we don’t want that to stop you from applying. You may request an application fee waiver by emailing us at engineering.gradinfo@nyu.edu.\nAs part of your application, you are expected to respond, in writing, to two prompts. A response to both prompts is required. This is an opportunity for you to give us a stronger sense of who you are, as a person. Your essay should be as unique as you are and should be written using your voice. Include each prompt as the header for each of your two responses. When finished, combine your response to both prompts into one PDF and upload it to the application. Your total essay upload should be in 12 pt, Arial font and no more than two pages, double-spaced, in length.\nPrompt 1: Drawing from your previous academic, professional and personal experiences, tell us what attracted you to the program of study you have noted in your application. Be very specific about your past experiences and how they shaped your interests.\nPrompt 2: Students often have a wide range of ideas and plans for what they hope to achieve after they receive their graduate degree. Tell us what your 5-year plan is after completing a degree from NYU Tandon.\nA copy of your most recent résumé or curriculum vitae must be uploaded to the online application.\nFor admissions review, we will accept copies of your official transcript and proof of undergraduate degree (if completed) uploaded to your application or emailed to us at engineering.gradinfo@nyu.edu. Screenshots or student portal downloads will not be accepted or used in your application review. We require transcripts from all institutions attended.\nIf you are offered admission, we will require official final transcripts sent to our office directly from your undergraduate institution to finalize your admission, before enrollment in your first semester. To satisfy this requirement, we will accept hard copy/physical transcripts, or electronic transcripts. No scanned copies will be accepted once you've been admitted.\nA hard copy or physical transcript is considered official when it is in a sealed, unopened envelope mailed directly from your previous institution to NYU Tandon. An electronic transcript is considered official if it is sent through a digital credential service such as Parchment, Student Clearinghouse, Credential Solutions or a similar, secure third-party platform, or emailed directly from your institution’s registrar’s office.\nPlease see sections below for specific country requirements.\nOfficial transcripts must be received in a sealed envelope from the institution.\nThe Office of Graduate Enrollment Management and Admissions office conducts an independent, external evaluation of credentials (at no additional cost to the student). As such, there is no need to submit additional course-by-course evaluations. We do not accept credential evaluation reports like WES, ECE, etc. in place of your original transcripts. Failure to submit the correct documentation will delay the processing of your application.
