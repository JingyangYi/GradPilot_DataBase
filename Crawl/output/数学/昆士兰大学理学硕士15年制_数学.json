Knowing the costs and what support is available will help you manage your money.\nBefore you apply for university, there are some costs to consider. These include:\nFor some postgraduate coursework programs you'll pay full tuition fees.\nFor postgraduate domestic students, tuition fees are program-based. This means you'll pay the same tuition fee for each course you study in your program during one academic year.\nTuition fees increase annually. The increase is usually fixed 12 months in advance, so you can plan your finances ahead of time.\nYou can pay these fees upfront or, if you're eligible, defer them through a FEE-HELP loan.\nActual fees may be lower or higher depending on the time you take to complete a program. Fees are reviewed annually and may be higher in later years.\nSome programs also have extra costs for things like equipment or field trips. These costs are listed on the program page.\nMost postgraduate programs at UQ have Commonwealth supported places (CSPs) available for eligible students. A CSP is a place that’s partially funded by the Australian Government.\nThe Government subsidises a CSP by paying part of the fee directly to the university. The subsidy amount isn't a loan – you don’t have to pay this amount back.\nBut you’re required to pay the remainder of the fee, known as the 'student contribution amount', for each course you’re enrolled in. You can pay this fee upfront or, if you're eligible, defer it through a HECS-HELP loan.\nStudents do not need to apply separately for a CSP. Eligible students that submit a completed application by the closing date and meet the program’s entry requirements for the chosen program will automatically be considered for a CSP.\nLearn more about eligibility for CSPs\nThe following postgraduate programs are offered to domestic students on a Commonwealth-supported basis in 2025:\nStudent contributions are reviewed annually and may be higher in later years. Postgraduate programs with CSPs vary from year to year.\nYou can view the fee type for each program under the 'Fees and Scholarships' tab of each program page.\nMost Australian universities charge a compulsory Student Services and Amenities Fee (SSAF).\nThe SSAF is used to fund non-academic services for students, including sports and recreation, employment and career advice, child care and food services.\nThe maximum annual fee is $365 for 2025. This fee increases annually. The amount you have to pay will depend on whether you're an internal or external student, and whether you study full-time or part-time.\nYou can pay this fee upfront or, if you're eligible, defer it through an SA-HELP loan.\nLearn more about the Student Services and Amenities Fee (SSAF)\nUnder certain circumstances, you may have to pay additional administrative fees for things like:\nFor a full list of administrative fees, see our fee schedules.\nThere's a range of other costs you may need to pay for, including accommodation, textbooks and transport.

Our living costs guide can help you budget for common expenses.\nLearn more about the cost of living in Brisbane\nTo help you cover your costs, there's a range of financial support available, including:\nThe Higher Education Loan Program (HELP) offers several schemes to support eligible students with the cost of their education. There are 3 main schemes that support postgraduate students:\nIf you're a full-fee paying student, you may be able to use a FEE-HELP loan to cover your tuition fees.\nYou can apply for FEE-HELP if you are:\nWe'll guide you through how to apply for FEE-HELP once you've accepted an offer to study at UQ.\nThere is a limit to the combined amount you can borrow through HELP loans to cover course fees. This includes HECS-HELP loans incurred from 2020 onwards, and all existing and new FEE-HELP loans.\nIf you're accepted in a Commonwealth Supported Place, you can't use FEE-HELP – you'll need to use HECS-HELP instead.\nLearn more about FEE-HELP\nIf you're enrolled in a Commonwealth Supported Place (CSP), you may be able to use a HECS-HELP loan to cover your student contribution amount.\nTo be eligible for HECS-HELP you must be enrolled in a Commonwealth Supported Place, and be:\nWe'll guide you through how to apply for HECS-HELP once you've accepted an offer to study at UQ.\nLearn more about HECS-HELP\nSA-HELP is a loan scheme that helps students pay their Student Services and Amenities Fee.\nIf you're eligible for HECS-HELP or FEE-HELP, you'll usually also be eligible for SA-HELP. You can use SA-HELP even if you don't take out any other HELP loan.\nWe'll guide you through how to apply for SA-HELP once you've accepted an offer to study at UQ.\nLearn more about SA-HELP\nScholarships can help make your university experience more affordable. We offer more scholarships than any other university in Queensland, so it's worth taking some time to research and apply.\nApplication opening and closing dates vary, so search for scholarships as early as possible to ensure you don't miss application deadlines.\nFind a scholarship\nThe Australian Government has approved some masters programs for Centrelink income support to eligible students. Check the program page under ‘Fees and scholarships’ to find out whether the program you're interested in is approved.\nTuition fees for international students are program-based. This means you'll pay the same tuition fee for each course you study in your program during one academic year.\nTo help you estimate your costs, check our indicative fees. The list shows the average annual cost and estimated total cost of tuition fees for full-time study in each of our programs.\nNon-tuition fees are other fees you may need to pay to UQ.

It typically takes between 6 months (full-time) and 2 years (spread out part-time) to get a graduate certificate.\nFor comparison, most master’s programs take at least 1.5 years of full-time study. The benefit of that extra time commitment is that getting your master’s is highly worthwhile. Employers are likely to place higher value on a master’s degree (vs a graduate certificate), as many see these as the pinnacle of developing industry knowledge and skills. Does that mean a graduate certificate isn't worth it, though? Not at all.\nAfter completing your graduate certificate, you may want to continue your study and transition into a graduate diploma. Starting with the grad cert is a great option if you’re unsure about your chosen field, as it gives you the flexibility to finish with those foundational skills or progress seamlessly into a higher degree in the same field.

It’s no wonder we’ve won more national teaching awards than any other university in the country (Australian Learning and Teaching Council).\nOur student-centred approach to learning – enhanced by the flexible options available in many programs – allows you to tailor your education to suit your interests and desired outcomes.\n\nMany UQ postgraduate degrees include a capstone project or industry placement, so you can specialise in a field or niche that matches your career aspirations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Marta Indulska and Dr Ida Asadi Someh work in the UQ Business School, developing programs such as the Master of Business Analytics \n\n2. Outstanding reputation\nAs a global top-50 university, UQ is one of Australia’s leading research and teaching institutions.\nBut this doesn’t just mean we have a culture of research excellence and that we get to brag a little (though, yes, both those things are true). It also means we attract the most passionate and talented students and teachers. So, when you choose UQ, you’ll know you’re studying among the brightest minds around – perfect for postgraduates seeking to extend and challenge their thinking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI chose UQ for my postgraduate degree because of its prestigious ranking, steadfast dedication to academic excellence, mentorship from esteemed professionals, and the chance to flourish within the dynamic UQ community.\n\n\n        Ruchita Rajkumar Bhansali\n      \n\n        Master of Public Health\n      \n\n\n\n3. Fantastic career outcomes\nThanks largely to our reputation and teachers, our programs are recognised and highly regarded both nationally and globally. People with postgraduate degrees from UQ are in demand around the world, contributing to our high employment and graduate satisfaction rates.\n\n93% of UQ postgrads are employed, with 86.8% in full-time employment (2023 Graduate Outcomes Survey).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaster of Entrepreneurship and Innovation alumnus Natalie Hurtado co-founded her own organisation, ARTEH, with UQ academic Dr Saphira Rekker \n\nAs a UQ postgraduate, you’ll also join our global alumni network, gaining access to alumni benefits including:\n\nexclusive events\nmentoring opportunities\nthe ilab Accelerator Program\nfree UQx online courses, plus professional development courses from UQ Business School\na 10% Lifelong Learner scholarship for any UQ postgrad programs you study in the future.\n\nAll these benefits can help you elevate your career further after you graduate.\n4. Wide range of programs\nWith more than 100 research institutes and centres across 10 study areas, UQ provides a postgraduate program to suit almost any student.\nThe University of Queensland offers around 100 master’s programs alone, giving you access to a wide breadth of options for developing or changing your career.\n5. World-class campus and facilities\nWhether you study at our St Lucia, Herston or Gatton campus, you’ll have access to state-of-the-art research facilities during your UQ postgraduate program. We’re also home to one of Australia’s largest academic libraries.\nBut what would all this substance be without a little style? As well as providing students with all the practical facilities they need, our campuses are also stunning to see. From St Lucia’s glorious Great Court to the iconic palm-lined walkway at Gatton, there’s no shortage of idyllic locations to study and relax between classes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUQ Lakes is a lovely spot for some thoughtful downtime, as demonstrated here by UQ academic Dr Alastair Stark \n\n\nUQ is a wonderful place to take your career and education a step further with postgraduate study. If you want to be ready to face any unknown, start your postgraduate journey today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\nRelated stories\n\n\n\nCareers\n            Is it worth doing a master’s degree?\n    \n\n      4-minute read\n    \n            Is it worth doing a master’s degree?\n    \n\nCareers\n            Is it ever too late to change careers?\n    \n\n      8-minute read\n    \n            Is it ever too late to change careers?\n    \n\nUni life\n            How UQ provides flexibility for postgraduates\n    \n\n      4-minute read\n    \n            How UQ provides flexibility for postgraduates\n    \n\nStudy tips\n            Why now is the perfect time to do postgrad study\n    \n\n      3-minute read\n    \n            Why now is the perfect time to do postgrad study\n[CARD]\nCareers\n            Is it worth doing a master’s degree?\n    \n\n      4-minute read\n[CARD]\nCareers\n[CARD]\nIs it worth doing a master’s degree?\n[CARD]\nCareers\n            Is it ever too late to change careers?\n    \n\n      8-minute read\n[CARD]\nCareers\n[CARD]\nIs it ever too late to change careers?\n[CARD]\nUni life\n            How UQ provides flexibility for postgraduates\n    \n\n      4-minute read\n[CARD]\nUni life\n[CARD]\nHow UQ provides flexibility for postgraduates\n[CARD]\nStudy tips\n            Why now is the perfect time to do postgrad study\n    \n\n      3-minute read\n[CARD]\nStudy tips\n[CARD]\nWhy now is the perfect time to do postgrad study",

It makes sense to get some reassurance that doing a master’s is worth it. After all, why do postgraduate study if you don’t know how it’s going to benefit you?\nWith the cost of living weighing heavily on most of our minds, making more money seems like the obvious motivation to consider studying a master's degree. This is completely valid – and yes, UQ postgraduates do enjoy an average salary increase of 36% within 3 years of graduating. But boosting your income is far from the only reason to invest in further education.\nSo, let's explore all the potential rewards. You can use the facts, figures and outcomes below to weigh up whether it’s worth doing a master’s degree in your near future.\nLet’s start with salaries. The average postgraduate increases their pay by 36% within just 3 years of graduating – from around $71,000 to $96,600.*\n*Based on median salaries reported by domestic postgraduate coursework graduates employed full time and surveyed between 2022 and 2024 in the Graduate Outcomes Survey by Quality Indicators for Learning and Teaching (QILT).\nThis means that while a postgrad program is indeed a financial investment, it doesn't typically take long for it to start paying itself off.\nFind your master's degree\nCompleting a master's degree isn't necessarily a direct shortcut to a salary increase. More often, your extra degree will help you rise to a higher position that comes with a more generous salary.\nThe lucrative and more satisfying role you’d like may only be available to candidates with postgraduate qualifications. For example, some of the most high-paying jobs that usually require a master’s degree include:\n*Average salaries taken from Seek and Indeed, last updated April 2025.\nThis is far from an exhaustive list. Many industries have high-paying jobs that tend to be filled by people with postgraduate education.\nThese statistics about pay increases and promotions are nice and all. But getting a job in the first place might be your top priority and therefore the most significant reason why a master's degree is important.\nQILT's 2023 Graduate Outcomes Survey provides insight into this, revealing that 93.9% of coursework postgraduates are employed (vs 88.9% of undergraduates), and that 90.3% of coursework postgraduates have full-time employment (compared to 79% of undergraduates).\nNot every reason to do a master’s degree can be measured or calculated.\nThe sense of accomplishment and fulfilment that comes with truly mastering your area of interest may not add another zero to your salary, but this could still be the most valuable benefit for you. Postgraduate study may be a key step towards discovering your ikigai (your life purpose). Or it may help you feel truly comfortable in your career (e.g. speaking with more confidence in the workplace or overcoming imposter syndrome).\nDuring uncertain times, extending your education can give you the adaptability and transferrable knowledge to pivot into new roles. Nobody knows what the world might look like in the coming decades, but a master’s degree can help you prepare for it.\nYou may also choose to study a master’s degree in a specific field or industry that is more stable than your current profession or is projected to grow in the future. Doing so can give you more career options and help you bounce back if your existing role ceases to exist.\n“Investing in up-skilling in a growing field could help you gain job security, future-proof your career and increase your earning potential.”\n- QS Top Universities\nThe teachers aren’t the only important people you’ll meet and learn from during your master’s degree. Postgraduate study also provides the opportunity to stretch your professional network and make lifelong connections with like-minded peers.\nAs you can see, there are plenty of strong reasons to do postgraduate study. But whether doing a master’s degree is worthwhile ultimately comes down to your needs and motivations – as well as how much you value them.\nFor example:\nConversely, if you’re comfortable with your current role, trajectory, salary and knowledge level, the answer to the question 'should I do postgraduate study?' may be 'perhaps not at this stage in my career'.\nUnderstanding your reasons and their importance is vital when enrolling in postgraduate study. Not only does this help you successfully complete your degree, but it also ensures you enter your studies with the right mindset to get the most out of your time back at uni.\nDiscover your postgraduate study options at UQ\n3-minute read\n5-minute read\n4-minute read\n6-minute read\n• a citizen of Australia or New Zealand,\n• an Australian permanent resident, or\n• a holder of an Australian permanent humanitarian visa.\n• intending to study on a student visa,\n• not a citizen of Australia or New Zealand,\n• not an Australian permanent resident, or\n• a temporary resident (visa status) of Australia.\n• aerospace engineer ($115K–$135K average annual salary in Queensland)\n• architecture manager ($140K–$160K)\n• information systems manager ($140K–$160K)\n• data scientist ($115K–$135K)\n• economist ($85K–$100K)\n• epidemiologist (~$113K)\n• financial manager ($125K–$145K)\n• nurse practitioner ($150K–$155K)\n• occupational therapist ($85K–$100K)\n• petroleum engineer (~$129K)\n• psychologist ($100K–$110K).*\n• If you’re feeling stuck in your career or missing key milestones such as promotions and pay rises, a postgraduate degree could be an essential stepping stone towards improving your career satisfaction.\n• If excelling in your field and being a thought leader in your organisation is important to you, a master’s could give you a crucial step-up.\n• If you’ve discovered a deeper passion in a different line of work, further study could be the ideal way to sidestep into a new industry without having to start from scratch.\n[GRID_TABLE]\nYou're a domestic student if you are:\n\na citizen of Australia or New Zealand,\nan Australian permanent resident, or\na holder of an Australian permanent humanitarian visa.\n\n\nChange to domestic\nContinue as domestic\nYou're an international student if you are:\n\nintending to study on a student visa,\nnot a citizen of Australia or New Zealand,\nnot an Australian permanent resident, or\na temporary resident (visa status) of Australia.\n\n\nChange to international\nContinue as international\n[GRID_TABLE]\nCareers\nPublished 15 Apr, 2025  ·  4-minute read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnrolling in postgraduate study is a big decision and a significant commitment.
