Typical MADS cohort sizes will range from 25-35 students.\nStudents who are an ideal fit for the MADS program desire a career in a fast-paced, high-growth industry in the United States immediately following graduation. The MADS program builds foundational skills in statistical computing and data analysis, and it is also intended to assist students in identifying and focusing on industries and positions relevant to their aptitudes and interests, navigating the job market, and positioning graduates to successfully navigate careers post-graduation.\nThe MADS Program prepares graduates to:\nMADS graduates have successfully gained positions as data scientists, data analysts, and data engineers in diverse industries such as banking, sports, health care, government, and tech.\nPlease contact mads-admissions@stat.cmu.edu.\nThe MADS team commits to providing clarity, direction, transparency, and support as you embark on this next step in your life and career. Together, we will develop an environment of high achievement, thoughtful personal and professional development, and meaningful collaboration, with a culture of integrity and inclusiveness.\nJamie McGovern\nJamie joined the university in 2020 after more than 20 years in Management Consulting. He graduated from Rice University with a degree in economics and managerial studies, then embarked on a career working with global organizations across a variety of industries, including media & entertainment, financial services, consumer products, life sciences and biopharmaceuticals, energy & utilities, and industrial manufacturing. Over the span of his consulting career, he progressed from an entry-level analyst working on human capital strategy and technology, to a service line executive, managing director, and partner, responsible for solutioning, selling, and delivering global transformational engagements for some of the largest public and private sector entities in the world. Jamie’s international experience included project engagements and international assignments in Paris, London, Madrid, Málaga, Rome, Brussels, Vienna, Singapore, Tokyo, Beijing, and Sao Paulo. Internally, he was responsible for more than 80 direct and indirect reporting practitioners, and in his client-facing work he led diverse, cross-border teams of more than 100 practitioners engaged in the design and delivery of functional and technical solutions.\nJamie later co-founded and led a data science consultancy with a socially beneficial mission, creating career and mobility opportunities for historically underserved populations. That organization worked with supply chain, bio-pharma, and media & public relations entities to make their data useful by cleaning, consolidating, modeling, and visualizing large structured and unstructured data sets, in an effort to drive intelligent strategic decisions, optimize business processes, and create competitive advantages in the market.\nTo assist students, Jamie:\nTeraya White\nAcademic Program Manager, Master of Science in Applied Data Science\nTeraya joined the university in 2020. She leverages 20+ years of experience identifying and developing resources to actively contribute to the region's emergence as an innovation hub and destination for top talent. Her work experience extends from higher education, human capital management, and talent acquisition. As the Academic Program Manager for MADS, Teraya works closely with current MADS students and prospective students. She is a champion for diversity, equity, and inclusion within the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences, expanding CMU's recruiting presence at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and presenting educational opportunities to historically underrepresented groups at the American Statistical Society-sponsored StatFest conference. Teraya also assists with the popular Pittsburgh Women in Data Science conference (WiDS), featuring thought leadership shared by women speakers from academia and industry.\nTo assist students, Teraya:\nThe MADS program has gained recognition as a finalist in the 2024 NFL Big Data Bowl. A team of students—Shane Hauck, Marion Haney, Devin Basley, and Vinay Maruri—mentored by Assistant Teaching Professor Ron Yurko and football coach Ryan Larsen, developed a metric to analyze the defensive strategy of “setting the edge.” Their innovative work earned them a $12,500 prize and a chance to present at the NFL Scouting Combine.\nThis collaboration provided students invaluable experience in working with domain experts, enhancing their project and skillset. The research aims to quantify player contributions that often go unnoticed, showcasing CMU’s leadership in sports analytics. With over 50 past participants hired in sports data roles, CMU is a top choice for those seeking a career in this dynamic field.\nWe are committed to making a societal impact in the Pittsburgh and Southwestern Pennsylvania area. One of our community partners is  AD99 Solutions Foundation. We also have presented at the Pittsburgh Public Schools to discuss the importance of STEM education.\nThe MADS team holds frequent virtual information sessions for prospective students - for more information please feel free to reach out to us at mads-admission@stat.cmu.edu.\nSeptember 10, 2025 at noon ET\nNovember 5, 2025 at noon ET\nDecember 10, 2025 at noon ET\n• Perform a complete and effective analysis of a real data set, choosing appropriate procedures and critically assessing the strengths/weaknesses at each step, and evaluating the validity of the results.\n• Represent data, code algorithms, and competently use a sophisticated statistical computing framework.\n• Use statistical theory to explain how a statistical methodology works, explain assumptions and limitations of a methodology, and to derive a reasonable statistical procedure that solves a statistical problem.\n• Effectively and clearly communicate complex statistical ideas to a non-specialist -- orally and in writing, to adapt an analysis to their goals and to communicate results that address their questions.

We will answer your questions, discuss the curriculum, and provide you with the tools needed for success in the courses. We will also answer your questions about life at Carnegie Mellon and life in Pittsburgh. Most importantly, the cohort is introduced to each other.\n\nDuring the Program\nYou will receive instruction from world-class faculty. MADS has an intentionally small cohort so that we can focus on YOU. By delivering a hands-on experience, we are invested in your success. For 9 months, we work with you to learn your career interests, help you navigate the career path, and make sure that you receive any resources that you need. Simply put, we set you up for success. With the exception of your electives, you will take classes exclusively with your cohort. This allows you to bond as classmates and future colleagues.\n\nAfter the Program\nOnce you graduate from the program, you transition to one of our distinguished alumni. If you choose, we continue to keep you informed about opportunities to connect with future MADS students, department and program updates, and career opportunities.\n[CARD]\nMeet the MADS Team \n\nJamie McGovern\nSpecial Faculty, Director, Master of Science in Applied Data Science Program\nJamie joined the university in 2020 after more than 20 years in Management Consulting.
