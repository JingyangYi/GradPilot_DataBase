Graduate students pursue a course of study in either Applied Statistics or Measurement & Evaluation. We offer specialized knowledge in test theory, experimental design, instrument development and validation, and quantitative analysis of educational and psychological data.\nThe M.S. in Applied Statistics (32-credits) provides training for a number of data-science positions in applied research settings, testing organizations, and businesses. The degree requires three semesters of full-time study, and students can complete the program in one year (fall/spring/summer).\nThe Ed.M. in Measurement and Evaluation (60-credits) is a two-year master's degree. It provides training for a number of positions in educational research bureaus and testing organizations. Coursework includes psychometric theory, program evaluation in the social sciences and public health, quantitative methods, research methods, and psychology.\nThe Ph.D. in Measurement & Evaluation (75-credits) is designed to prepare graduates for careers in a wide range of educational settings. Graduates acquire specialized knowledge and skills in test theory, test and instrument development and validation, program evaluation, and quantitative analysis of educational and psychological data.\nA doctorate is required for most college teaching positions and for positions of professional responsibility in testing organizations, departments of education, and licensure and certification boards. The Ph.D. is appropriate for individuals with strong quantitative and technical skills who wish to focus on theoretical issues in measurement and evaluation or who have a strong background in a substantive area of psychology in which they wish to further the development and application of measurement techniques.\nBoth the Ph.D. and Ed.D. are accepted as qualification for faculty positions in schools of education in the United States.\nProgram Director: Dr. Bryan Keller\nAcademic Secretary:  Rachel Chung\nPhone: (212)-678-3359\nEmail: hud1@tc.columbia.edu\n• M.S. in Applied Statistics\n• Ed.M. in Measurement & Evaluation\n• Ph.D. in Measurement & Evaluation\n• View as grid\n• View as list\n• Master of Science\r\n    \n\nApplied Statistics\n• Applied Statistics\n• Doctor of Philosophy\r\n    \n\nMeasurement and Evaluation\n• Measurement and Evaluation\n• Master of Education\r\n    \n\nMeasurement and Evaluation\n• Measurement and Evaluation\n• Doctor of Education\r\n    \n\nMeasurement and Evaluation\n[Program is not accepting applications for the 2026 cycle.]\n• Measurement and Evaluation\n[Program is not accepting applications for the 2026 cycle.]\n• Applied Statistics\n• Measurement and Evaluation\n• Measurement and Evaluation\n• Measurement and Evaluation\n[Program is not accepting applications for the 2026 cycle.]\n• Tuition & Fees\n• Financial Aid\n• Request Info\n• Apply Now\n[GRID_TABLE]\nQuantitative Analysis with Real Data\nStudy with our faculty of internationally recognized experts and gain experience working with real data. \nApply Today!\nQuantitative Analysis with Real Data\nStudy with our faculty of internationally recognized experts and gain experience working with real data. \nApply Today!\nApplied Statistics\nApplied Statistics\nMeasurement and Evaluation\nMeasurement and Evaluation\nMeasurement and Evaluation\nMeasurement and Evaluation\nMeasurement and Evaluation\n[Program is not accepting applications for the 2026 cycle.]\nMeasurement and Evaluation\n[Program is not accepting applications for the 2026 cycle.]\n[CARD]\nApplication Requirements\nMaster of Science\r\n    \n\nApplied Statistics\n\n\nDoctor of Philosophy\r\n    \n\nMeasurement and Evaluation\n\n\nMaster of Education\r\n    \n\nMeasurement and Evaluation\n\n\nDoctor of Education\r\n    \n\nMeasurement and Evaluation\n[Program is not accepting applications for the 2026 cycle.]\n\n\n\n\n\nFund Your Degree\n\nTuition & Fees\nFinancial Aid\n[CARD]\nBox: 118",
