In the second semester, students will take an advanced course in modern applied statistics (STAT 230), an elective, and a capstone course. The capstone will consist of a team-based learning experience that will give students the opportunity to work on a real-world problem and carry out a substantial data analysis project. It will culminate with a written report and an oral presentation of findings. The elective will depend on the student’s interests and will be decided in consultation with advisers. For a complete list of courses offered by the department and course descriptions, please visit the academic guide.\nAll coursework used for the M.A. must be letter graded unless the course is only offered on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory (S/U) basis.\nElective courses are chosen with the guidance and approval of the MA program Chair. Generally, the elective must be a graduate level course related to statistics. Such courses can be within the Statistics Department or from other departments. Some examples of popular past electives:\nIf an elective that you would like to take is not on the list the course can be submitted for department approval. You can submit your request using the Google Form here. If you take an approved elective that is less than 4 units you will need to take another elective and/or approved seminar course to meet the 24 unit minimum requirement for the program. *Approved electives are subject to change.\nIn extremely rare cases, a thesis option may be considered by the M.A. Chair. Typically, this will be when either the option has been offered to the student at the time of admission, or if the student arrives with substantial progress in research in an area of interest to our faculty. If approved by the M.A. Chair for the thesis option you will not have to take the comprehensive exam.\nIf approved for the thesis option, you must find three faculty to be on your thesis committee.One of the faculty on must be from outside the Statistics Department. Both you and the thesis committee chair must agree on the topic of your thesis. Please provide a short description of your thesis topic, the names of your committee members and the signature of your committee chair on the Worksheet for the MA in Statistics, Thesis Option. In addition, you will also need to complete Graduate Division’s Application for Candidacy for the Master's Degree (Plan 1 - Thesis)\nPrepare for a career in data science and statistics with our Professional Development resources. Workshops, alumni insights, and individual advising sessions are available to help you succeed.\nEquip yourself for your MA Statistics journey with our intensive 2-week Summer Prep Program. Strengthen your mathematical foundations, explore statistical concepts, and dive into probability theory.\nCourse selection will be done in consultation with Statistics Department MA Chair and/or committee member. Some students do take additional courses, including courses in other departments, depending on their background and level of preparation. Other professional graduate programs on campus all have their own policies for enrollment in their courses. After appropriate consultation, students will need to check these policies before registering for such courses.\nThere is no transfer process into the PhD program. To be accepted, you must apply and be evaluated alongside all other applicants during the current admission cycle. Please note that admission to the UC Berkeley Statistics PhD program is highly competitive.\nAll coursework for the MA must be completed by the end of the semester in which you intend to graduate. In order to advance to candidacy, you need to complete the MA Statistics Comprehensive Exam and complete all the required MA coursework. For those approved by the MA Program Committee Chair, to apply for the MA thesis option, you will have to submit individual application for advancement that lists the proposed committee for the thesis through CalCentral.\nEach semester, graduate students have till the Friday of the third week of classes to add/drop courses on Cal Central. If you want to add/drop courses after the third week, you will have to complete a form called the Graduate Petition to Change Class Schedule. After completing the form, please submit it to the Master's Program Coordinator in 375 Evans so that it can be processed. The form can be given in person or put in the MA Program Coordinator's mailbox in 367 Evans. It must be submitted before the last day of classes in each semester, which occurs before the week of final exams.\nFor information about graduate student life and housing options, please visit Resources & Services for Graduate Students and the Statistics Graduate Student Association.\nWe do not admit students based on national origin and we do not have fixed proportions of domestic and international students. The city of Berkeley and the Department of Statistics have always had a diverse and lively international community.\nFor questions regarding visas, employment of international students, or any other questions regarding temporary stay in the United States, please visit the Berkeley International Office Website or call them at (510) 642-2818.\nYes, the MA Statistics program is eligible for the STEM OPT extension.

In the second semester, students will take an advanced course in modern applied statistics (STAT 230), an elective, and a capstone course. The capstone will consist of a team-based learning experience that will give students the opportunity to work on a real-world problem and carry out a substantial data analysis project. It will culminate with a written report and an oral presentation of findings. The elective will depend on the student’s interests and will be decided in consultation with advisers. For a complete list of courses offered by the department and course descriptions, please visit the academic guide.\nAll coursework used for the M.A. must be letter graded unless the course is only offered on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory (S/U) basis. \n\n\n\nShortly before or immediately after the start of spring classes in January, students will take a comprehensive exam on the theoretical foundations of statistics. There will be a two hour exam on the material of 201A and on the material of 201B. All students taking the exam will receive copies of previous examinations.\n\n\n\nElective courses are chosen with the guidance and approval of the MA program Chair. Generally, the elective must be a graduate level course related to statistics. Such courses can be within the Statistics Department or from other departments. Some examples of popular past electives:\n\nSTAT 248: Analysis of Time Series\nSTAT 254: Modern Statistical Prediction and Machine Learning\nSTAT 260: Topics in Probability and Statistics\n\n\nElectives Approved for 2024/2025*\n\n\n\n\nDept\nNumber\nTitle\nUnits\n\n\nCOMPSCI \n194-26\nIntro to Computer Vision and Computational Photography\n4\n\n\nCOMPSCI \nC281A\nStatistical Learning Theory\n3\n\n\nCOMPSCI \n271\nRandomness and Computation\n3\n\n\nCOMPSCI \n289\nMachine Learning\n4\n\n\nCOMPSCI \n282A\nDesigning, Visualizing and Understanding Deep Neural Networks\n4\n\n\nCYPLAN\n255\nUrban Informatics and Visualization\n3\n\n\nEECS\n227AT\nOptimization Models in Engineering\n4\n\n\nELENG\nC227C\nConvex Optimization and Approximation\n3\n\n\nESPM\n215\nHierarchical Statistical Models in EnvSci\n2\n\n\nINDENG\n235\nApplied Data Science with Venture Applications\n3\n\n\nINDENG\n262\nMathematical Programming (optimization)\n4\n\n\nINDENG\n263\nApplied Stochastic Processes\n4\n\n\nINDENG\n265\nLearning and Optimization\n3\n\n\nINDENG\n242\nApplications in Data Analysis\n3\n\n\nINFO\n251\nApplied Machine Learning\n4\n\n\nINFO\n254\nData Mining and Analytics\n3\n\n\nINFO\n256\nApplied Natural Language Processing\n3\n\n\nINFO\n259\nNatural Language Processing\n3\n\n\nINFO\nC260F\nMachine Learning in Education\n3\n\n\nMATH\n221\nAdvanced Matrix Computation\n4\n\n\nPBHLTH\nW214R\nStatistical Analysis of Categorical Data\n4\n\n\nPBHLTH\nC240C\nBiostatistical Methods: Computational Statistics\n4\n\n\nPBHLTH\n252D\nCausal Inference 1\n4\n\n\nSTAT\n150\nStochastic Processes\n3\n\n\nSTAT\n152\nSampling Surveys\n4\n\n\nSTAT\n153\nIntroduction to Time Series\n4\n\n\nSTAT\n154\nModern Statistical Prediction and Machine Learning\n4\n\n\nSTAT\n158\nThe Design and Analysis of Experiments\n4\n\n\nSTAT\n232\nExperimental Design\n4\n\n\nSTAT\nC241B\nAdvanced Topics in Learning and Decision Making\n4\n\n\nSTAT\n248\nAnalysis of Time Series\n4\n\n\nSTAT\n254\nModern Statistical Prediction and Machine Learning\n4\n\n\nSTAT\n260\nSpecial Topics\n3\n\n\nSTAT\n215A/B\nStatistical Models: Theory and Application\n4\n\n\nSTAT\n256/156\nCausal Inference\n4\n\n\n\n\n\nIf an elective that you would like to take is not on the list the course can be submitted for department approval. You can submit your request using the Google Form here. If you take an approved elective that is less than 4 units you will need to take another elective and/or approved seminar course to meet the 24 unit minimum requirement for the program. *Approved electives are subject to change.\n\n\n\nIn extremely rare cases, a thesis option may be considered by the M.A. Chair. Typically, this will be when either the option has been offered to the student at the time of admission, or if the student arrives with substantial progress in research in an area of interest to our faculty. If approved by the M.A. Chair for the thesis option you will not have to take the comprehensive exam.\nIf approved for the thesis option, you must find three faculty to be on your thesis committee.One of the faculty on must be from outside the Statistics Department. Both you and the thesis committee chair must agree on the topic of your thesis. Please provide a short description of your thesis topic, the names of your committee members and the signature of your committee chair on the Worksheet for the MA in Statistics, Thesis Option. In addition, you will also need to complete Graduate Division’s Application for Candidacy for the Master's Degree (Plan 1 - Thesis)\n\n\n\nAlthough the MA Statistics program is designed to be completed in two semesters (Fall & Spring), a limited number of students may be approved to extend into a third semester. Requests are considered on a case-by-case basis, based on program capacity, academic standing, and a clear justification for the extension (e.g., thesis work, additional coursework, internship alignment). Approval is not guaranteed and is subject to change each academic year.\n\n\n\n\n\n \nProfessional Development\nPrepare for a career in data science and statistics with our Professional Development resources. Workshops, alumni insights, and individual advising sessions are available to help you succeed.\n\n\n \nSummer Prep Program\nEquip yourself for your MA Statistics journey with our intensive 2-week Summer Prep Program. Strengthen your mathematical foundations, explore statistical concepts, and dive into probability theory.\n \n \n\n\nWill I be able to take courses other than those that are required?\nCourse selection will be done in consultation with Statistics Department MA Chair and/or committee member. Some students do take additional courses, including courses in other departments, depending on their background and level of preparation. Other professional graduate programs on campus all have their own policies for enrollment in their courses. After appropriate consultation, students will need to check these policies before registering for such courses.\nCan I transfer to the PhD program?\nThere is no transfer process into the PhD program. To be accepted, you must apply and be evaluated alongside all other applicants during the current admission cycle. Please note that admission to the UC Berkeley Statistics PhD program is highly competitive.\nHow to Advance to Candidacy\nAll coursework for the MA must be completed by the end of the semester in which you intend to graduate. In order to advance to candidacy, you need to complete the MA Statistics Comprehensive Exam and complete all the required MA coursework. For those approved by the MA Program Committee Chair, to apply for the MA thesis option, you will have to submit individual application for advancement that lists the proposed committee for the thesis through CalCentral.\nHow do I add/drop classes or change my grading option between letter grading and satisfactory/unsatisfactory (SU)?\nEach semester, graduate students have till the Friday of the third week of classes to add/drop courses on Cal Central. If you want to add/drop courses after the third week, you will have to complete a form called the Graduate Petition to Change Class Schedule. After completing the form, please submit it to the Master's Program Coordinator in 375 Evans so that it can be processed. The form can be given in person or put in the MA Program Coordinator's mailbox in 367 Evans.
