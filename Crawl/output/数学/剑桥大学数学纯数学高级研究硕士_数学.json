It is excellent preparation for mathematical research and it is also a valuable course in mathematics and its applications for those who want further training before taking posts in industry, teaching, or research establishments.\nStudents admitted from outside Cambridge to the Part III are admitted to the Master of Advanced Study (MASt). Cambrdige students continuing from the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos for a fourth-year are admitted to the Master of Mathematics (MMath). The requirements and course structure for MASt and the MMath are the same. Cambridge students interested in the MMAth should refer to this page for more information https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/postgrad/part-iii/information-part-ii-studen...\nThere are around 280 Part III (MASt and MMath) students each year; almost all are in their fourth or fifth year of university studies. Each year the Faculty offers up to 80 lecture courses in Part III, covering an extensive range of pure mathematics, probability, statistics, applied mathematics and theoretical physics. They are designed to cover those advanced parts of the subjects that are not normally covered in a first-degree course, but which are an indispensable preliminary to independent study and research. Students have a wide choice of the combination of courses they take, though naturally, they tend to select groups of cognate courses. Examples classes and associated marking of (unassessed) example sheets are provided as complementary support to lectures.\nAs a taught masters course, the main emphasis is on lecture courses, and assessment is almost entirely based on written exams, which are taken at the end of the academic year starting in the last week of May, alongside a mathematical essay, normally due in early May. The standard graduation dates for successful candidates are usually in June and July.\nAfter completing Part III, students will be expected to have:\nstudied advanced material in the mathematical sciences to a level not normally covered in a first degree;\nfurther developed the capacity for independent study of mathematics and problem-solving at a higher level; and\nundertaken an extended essay normally chosen from a list covering a wide range of topics.\nStudents are also expected to have acquired general transferable skills relevant to mathematics as outlined in the Faculty Transferable Skills Statement.\nMASt students wishing to apply for a PhD at Cambridge must apply via the Postgraduate Admissions webpage for readmission by the relevant deadline. Details of entry requirements can be found in the relevant course listings on this site.\nApplications to study in either of the Mathematics Departments will be considered on a case-by-case basis and offer of a place will usually include an academic condition based on Part III results.\nThe Postgraduate Virtual Open Day usually takes place at the beginning of November. It’s a great opportunity to ask questions to admissions staff and academics, explore the Colleges virtually, and to find out more about courses, the application process and funding opportunities. Visit the Postgraduate Open Day page for more details.\nSee further the Postgraduate Admissions Events pages for other events relating to Postgraduate study, including study fairs, visits and international events.\nThis course is advertised in the following departments:\nSome courses can close early. See the Deadlines page for guidance on when to apply.\nThese deadlines apply to applications for courses starting in Michaelmas 2025, Lent 2026 and Easter 2026.\nUniversity privacy policy\nInformation

It is excellent preparation for mathematical research and it is also a valuable course in mathematics and its applications for those who want further training before taking posts in industry, teaching, or research establishments.\nStudents admitted from outside Cambridge to the Part III are admitted to the Master of Advanced Study (MASt). Cambrdige students continuing from the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos for a fourth-year are admitted to the Master of Mathematics (MMath). The requirements and course structure for MASt and the MMath are the same. Cambridge students interested in the MMAth should refer to this page for more information https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/postgrad/part-iii/information-part-ii-studen...\nThere are around 280 Part III (MASt and MMath) students each year; almost all are in their fourth or fifth year of university studies. Each year the Faculty offers up to 80 lecture courses in Part III, covering an extensive range of pure mathematics, probability, statistics, applied mathematics and theoretical physics. They are designed to cover those advanced parts of the subjects that are not normally covered in a first-degree course, but which are an indispensable preliminary to independent study and research. Students have a wide choice of the combination of courses they take, though naturally, they tend to select groups of cognate courses.

There are normally about 75 courses, covering an extensive range of pure mathematics, probability, statistics, applied mathematics and theoretical physics. They are designed to cover those advanced parts of the subjects that are not normally covered in a first-degree course, but which are an indispensable preliminary to independent study and research. Students have a wide choice of the combination of courses that they offer, though naturally they tend to select groups of cognate courses. Example classes and associated marking of (unassessed) example sheets are provided as complementary support to lectures.\nAs a taught masters programme, learning in Part III takes place primarily via lecture courses, with assessment by means of examination papers taken at the end of the academic year (starting in late May or early June). In addition, students work during the year on an extended essay, on an approved topic, which is submitted for examination credit about a month before the written exam papers are taken. The standard graduation dates for successful candidates are in June and July.\nThe University values diversity and is committed to equality of opportunity.  The Faculty would particularly welcome applications from women, since women are, and have historically been, underrepresented in our student cohorts.\n© 2025 University of Cambridge\n• Study at Cambridge\n• About the University\n• Research

There are normally about 75 courses, covering an extensive range of pure mathematics, probability, statistics, applied mathematics and theoretical physics. They are designed to cover those advanced parts of the subjects that are not normally covered in a first-degree course, but which are an indispensable preliminary to independent study and research. Students have a wide choice of the combination of courses that they offer, though naturally they tend to select groups of cognate courses. Example classes and associated marking of (unassessed) example sheets are provided as complementary support to lectures.\nAs a taught masters programme, learning in Part III takes place primarily via lecture courses, with assessment by means of examination papers taken at the end of the academic year (starting in late May or early June).

There, you can create and submit your application and supporting documents, and you can also request your references.\nAn application is only complete when:\nIf you miss the deadlines specified in this section, you will not be able to submit your application.\nThe deadline for applications, including all supporting documents and references is 11:59pm (midnight) UK time on Tuesday 4 February 2025. If you wish to be considered for funding as part of the University Postgraduate Funding Competition, please ensure that you apply by the relevant (earlier) deadline, namely Tuesday 7 January 2025. These deadlines are strict, and we cannot accept applications except through the applicant portal.\nFor admissions purposes only, the MASt is divided into four streams:\nMASt in Mathematics (Applied Mathematics) (code: MASA)\nMASt in Mathematics (Pure Mathematics) (code: MASP)\nMASt in Mathematics (Mathematical Statistics) (code: MASS)\nMASt in Mathematics (Theoretical Physics) (code: MASTH)\nYou should apply to the course/stream that best fits the academic interests you wish to pursue. It may be helpful to review the Advice by Subject Area and Guide to Courses on our webpages to determine which is the most appropriate stream for you.\nIf you feel you might suit more than one stream, please only apply for one but detail the breadth of your mathematical interests on the application form. Your application will then be assessed by the Admissions Officers with the most relevant expertise to your interests.\nThe University values diversity and is committed to equality of opportunity. Both Departments particularly welcome applications from women since women are, and have historically been, underrepresented in our student cohorts.\nApplications are under review between November and March. While some decisions are made straight away, most applications are held until later in the admissions cycle so that they can be reviewed alongside other applications to the course. We aim to have all decisions made by the end of April. These decisions are final. You will receive updates through the Applicant Portal at key stages of the process.\nFurther information on How To Apply\nIn order to apply for this course you'll need to think about getting a few things ready before you apply.\nIf you wish to be considered for a Gates Cambridge Scholarship you will also need to provide the following:\nSee Gates Cambridge for more information.\nSome courses can close early. See the Deadlines page for guidance on when to apply.\nThese deadlines apply to applications for courses starting in Michaelmas 2025, Lent 2026 and Easter 2026.\nUniversity privacy policy\nInformation

Find out what your options are and how to request a change.\nOur terms start in October, January, or April. At Cambridge, these terms are called Michaelmas, Lent and Easter.\nYou can only request an alternative start date if your department accepts entries in other terms. Check the Course Directory for the start dates available for your course.\nMost of our MPhil courses start in October so you cannot choose a different start date.\nYou cannot request to defer to another academic year.\nInstead, you will need to make a new application and pay the application fee. You are not guaranteed an offer of a place in another academic year.\nYou should let your department know if you are planning to reapply.\nTalk to your department if you need to delay admission to the next year because of:\nWhere appropriate, the University, your College and your funder will work with you to change your start date.\nIf you haven't received an offer yet, contact your department or faculty to make the request.\nIf you have received an offer, request a deferral via your Self-Service account. The option to defer will only appear if your course accepts deferrals. You should also contact your department for further advice.\nIf your admission has already been confirmed, submit a request form. You should select ‘deferral’ as the topic. For your deferral request to be processed, we will need to unconfirm your place. If your deferral is approved, you will be re-confirmed once updates have been made.\nYour request must be submitted before the following dates:\nYour deferral will only be approved after agreement from the:\nIf your request is approved, you will not usually have to resubmit any academic documents.\nYou may need to provide an updated passport, ATAS certificate or language test, if any you have submitted will expire before your new start date.\nScholarships that you have been awarded will usually remain valid for the later start date. But, you will need to consult your sponsor if you wish to defer your offer. You will not automatically be considered for any other scholarships.\nIf your request is rejected by the University, your place to study will be withdrawn. If the College rejects your request, your application will be sent to another College for consideration.\nIt is not possible to use the same visa to start your course at a different time.\nIf you've already been issued a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS), visa sponsorship will need to be withdrawn.\nWe will issue a new CAS once the deferral is approved and you have met the conditions of your offer.\nIf your visa has already been granted, it will be curtailed. Your visa fees, including the immigration health surcharge, are not refundable.\nIf you have applied for your visa but the decision is pending, you will likely need to withdraw your visa application.

Find out what your options are and how to request a change. \n\nStarting in a different term \nOur terms start in October, January, or April. At Cambridge, these terms are called Michaelmas, Lent and Easter.\nYou can only request an alternative start date if your department accepts entries in other terms. Check the Course Directory for the start dates available for your course.\nMost of our MPhil courses start in October so you cannot choose a different start date. \n\nDeferring to another academic year \nYou cannot request to defer to another academic year.  \nInstead, you will need to make a new application and pay the application fee. You are not guaranteed an offer of a place in another academic year. \nYou should let your department know if you are planning to reapply. \nDelaying admission because of a disability, pregnancy or maternity leave \nTalk to your department if you need to delay admission to the next year because of: \n\na disability \npregnancy or maternity leave \n\nWhere appropriate, the University, your College and your funder will work with you to change your start date. \n\nHow to change your start date \nIf you haven't received an offer yet, contact your department or faculty to make the request. \nIf you have received an offer, request a deferral via your Self-Service account. The option to defer will only appear if your course accepts deferrals. You should also contact your department for further advice. \nIf your admission has already been confirmed, submit a request form. You should select ‘deferral’ as the topic. For your deferral request to be processed, we will need to unconfirm your place. If your deferral is approved, you will be re-confirmed once updates have been made. \nDeadlines for requesting a change \nYour request must be submitted before the following dates: \n\n11 October 2024 - deferring from October (Michaelmas) 2024 to January (Lent) 2025 or April (Easter) 2025 \n17 January 2025 - deferring from January (Lent) 2025 to April (Easter) 2025 \n\nApproval process \nYour deferral will only be approved after agreement from the: \n\ndepartment/faculty \ndegree committee \nCollege \nPostgraduate Admissions Office \n\nIf your request is approved, you will not usually have to resubmit any academic documents. \nYou may need to provide an updated passport, ATAS certificate or language test, if any you have submitted will expire before your new start date.  \nScholarships that you have been awarded will usually remain valid for the later start date. But, you will need to consult your sponsor if you wish to defer your offer. You will not automatically be considered for any other scholarships.  \nIf your request is rejected by the University, your place to study will be withdrawn. If the College rejects your request, your application will be sent to another College for consideration. \nVisa applications \nIt is not possible to use the same visa to start your course at a different time.  \nIf you've already been issued a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS), visa sponsorship will need to be withdrawn. \nWe will issue a new CAS once the deferral is approved and you have met the conditions of your offer. \nIf your visa has already been granted, it will be curtailed. Your visa fees, including the immigration health surcharge, are not refundable.  \n If you have applied for your visa but the decision is pending, you will likely need to withdraw your visa application.

We make most offers in February and March.\nFind out more about how we assess your application.\nIf your application is unsuccessful, you may find out sooner than those who receive an offer.\nOur application process is competitive and, unfortunately, there are many good applicants each year who don't get an offer of a place.\nYou are welcome to apply again in another academic year.\nIf we decide to make a conditional offer of admission, you will receive an email telling you this.\nYour offer will be conditional until you've met all the conditions of your offer.\nYou can manage your application through your Self-Service account. We will send you a link, an ID number (known as your USN) and a password to give you access to your account.\nYou can see details of your offer in the Self-Service account. This includes a certificate of the conditional offer of admission.\nIf you applied to more than one course, you may get more than one offer. You’ll need to choose one course and accept the offer for that course to have your admission confirmed.\nAt Cambridge, you will be a member of a College. In your application, you may have indicated a preference for 2 Colleges or opted to be allocated to a College.\nAfter we have made you a conditional offer of admission, we will send your application to Colleges for consideration. You should not contact Colleges yourself.\nYou will usually be told which College has accepted you within 3 weeks and you will then need to accept their offer of a place.\nFind out more about Cambridge Colleges.\nTo secure your place at the University, you will need to meet the conditions of your offer. Follow the guidance given in your offer email.\nCheck the next steps for confirming your place.\nIn your application, you can opt to be considered for University funding. If you are made an offer you will then be considered for funding. This is in addition to any funding you applied for separately.\nCheck the applying for funding page for information about when you will hear if you have been awarded funding.\nIf you do not hear from the funding body by July, you should assume that you have not been successful in securing funding.\nView, manage and check the

Only PAO can issue your official offer of admission on behalf of the University.\nThis part of the process takes about 10 days. However, it may take longer at peak periods.\nIf you are made a conditional offer, PAO will assess the documents you submit to meet the conditions of your offer and confirm your admission.\nIf you need a student visa, PAO will then process your Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS).\nFind out what happens when you get the outcome of your application and how to meet your offer conditions.\nView, manage and check the progress of your offer to

For most courses, you don’t need to do this until you’ve been made an offer.\nGet more information about our English language requirements.\nIf you don’t have a UK or Irish passport, you will usually need to apply for a student visa.\nYou don’t start this process until you have met all our offer conditions, your offer has been confirmed, and your Confirmation of Acceptance to Study (CAS) has been issued.\nIf you’ve applied to study a Science or Technology course, you may need to get Academic Technology Approval Scheme clearance. This will be an offer condition.\nFind out more about the visa application process.\nYou must complete and submit your application yourself.\nWe do not accept applications from agents. If your application is submitted by an agent, it will be withdrawn.\nIf an agent submits fraudulent information in your name, even without your knowledge, your application will be withdrawn and you may be banned from re-applying for 5 years.\nCreate, manage and track your postgraduate application.\nUniversity privacy policy\nInformation compliance\nEquality and Diversity\nTerms of Study\nAbout our

You can submit your application before your references have been uploaded.\nCheck the References page for full details.\nA transcript is an official summary of your academic record and the marks you have obtained to date.\nYou will need to provide academic transcripts and certificates for each degree you have taken.\nIf you are currently studying, you can provide an interim or unofficial transcript in your application. We will need a copy of the final transcript if we make you an offer.\nRequest your transcripts from your previous or current institution before you begin your application so that you have them ready to upload. The process can take a while. Your institution may charge you for this service.\nWhen you apply, upload scanned originals to the Applicant Portal.\nIf you are made an offer, you will be asked to send us your original documents or certified copies so that we can verify their authenticity.\nWe can’t accept any documents that have been written on or defaced in any way.\nIf your documents are not in English, you must upload a full translation of each document, prepared by a registered translator. Do not translate the documents yourself.\nYou must upload a CV to the Applicant Portal as part of your application.\nIf English is not your first language, you may need to show that you meet the English language requirement for your course.\nCheck our English language requirement page to see if this applies to you.\nFor most courses, you don’t need to provide your language test results until you're made an offer.\nA personal statement or statement of interest should describe your relevant skills, experience, academic achievements and motivation for applying to your chosen course.\nCheck our guidance on writing a personal statement.\nMost research courses will ask you to provide a research proposal.\nIf you choose to apply for more than one course, you must upload a research proposal for each application you submit, tailored to the individual requirements of each course.\nYour proposal should specify the research topic, make clear how it extends the existing literature, and why it is important within the discipline. It should also show that the project is feasible in the available time and resources.\nFind out more about writing a research proposal.\nSome courses may ask you to include samples of your written work. This helps departments to assess your knowledge and the level at which you are working.\nSome departments may ask you for a Graduate Record Examination (GRE) test score. If this is needed for your course, it will be stated on the course page.\nYou should not request a GRE score unless you have been told you need one. There is a charge for taking the GRE test.\nThe Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) is not accepted by any course.\nIf you have already applied for a scholarship and the awarding body has written to you, you can provide details in your application. If you're made an offer to study, you'll need to upload your funding letter to your Self-Service account.\nIf you wish to be considered for an award from Gates Cambridge, you will be asked to provide additional documents and an additional referee. See the Gates Cambridge website for details.\nYour supporting documents must be uploaded via the Applicant Portal by the relevant application deadline. This excludes references, which your referees will need to upload via the Referee Portal.\nDocuments should be:\nIf you are having difficulty uploading a document it may be encrypted or too large.

Check their funding information for details.\nYou can apply to be considered for most University funding through your course application in the Applicant Portal.\nIn the funding section of the portal, tick the box: 'Yes - I wish to apply for funding'.\nYou will then be considered for:\n*Some Cambridge Trust funds have quite specific eligibility requirements. It may not be obvious if you are eligible for these funds from the information given in your application. You will be able to specify any funds you feel you are 'particularly eligible' for in your application. This is not compulsory but it will help us identify the most suitable funding for you.\nYou can apply for other funds through the Applicant Portal that require you to complete extra fields within the form or upload an extra application form. These funds include:\nTo be considered for these funds, you will need to apply by the course funding deadline.\nSome University funds may ask for a separate application form. This is because they are administered separately.\nThe Postgraduate Funding Search lists many of these funds. You should also check individual funding websites, including College and department websites.\nSome of the Cambridge Trust’s partners need you to submit a separate application form. You will still need to tick 'Yes - I wish to apply for funding’ in the Application Portal. Check the Cambridge Trust website for details.\nThe deadline for these separate funding applications may be different to your course funding deadline.\nColleges at Cambridge offer some financial support to students but the majority of funding is not provided by them.\nMost College funding opportunities are listed in the Postgraduate Funding Search. You can also find College funding information on College websites.\nTo be eligible for College funding, many Colleges will ask you to select their College as a preference in your application. Some Colleges may still consider you for funding even if you did not select them. If you receive funding from a College, you must transfer to that College to accept the funding.\nAfter applying for funding:\nApplications that are missing one or both references are incomplete. The department will choose whether to consider incomplete applications for funding opportunities.\nOffers of funding and offers of admission are usually made separately.\nMost funding bodies start making offers from March. If you do not get a funding offer by July, you should assume your University funding application has not been successful. It’s unlikely that you will be given confirmation that your funding application was unsuccessful.\nContact the individual funding bodies for information on the status of your funding application. You can also check the Funding Search to find out when offers are made for University funds.\nSearch the University's database of postgraduate funding opportunities.\nUniversity privacy

least a year before your course begins.\nHow you apply for funding and by which deadline depends on the course and funding you’re applying for.\nExternal funding will have its own arrangements and you should contact the funder directly for guidance.\n\nFunding deadlines\nThere are 3 main University funding deadlines for the 2025/26 academic year:\n\n16 October 2024 (for US citizens applying to the Gates Cambridge Scholarship)\n3 December 2024\n7 January 2025\n\nDeadlines are course-specific so check the Course Directory to see which funding deadline applies to your course.\nYour full application (including references) must be submitted by 23:59 GMT on the relevant funding deadline.\nDepartment and College funding may have different deadlines. Check their funding information for details.\n\nApplying via the Applicant Portal\nTo be automatically considered for funding \nYou can apply to be considered for most University funding through your course application in the Applicant Portal.\nIn the funding section of the portal, tick the box: 'Yes - I wish to apply for funding'.\nYou will then be considered for:\n\nMost Cambridge Trust funds* (visit the Cambridge Trust website)\nHarding Distinguished Postgraduate Scholars Programme (Funding Search website) \nEconomic and Social Research Council (ESRC) (where eligible) \nEngineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) (where eligible) \nScience and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) (where eligible) \nSome department and College funds \n\n*Some Cambridge Trust funds have quite specific eligibility requirements. It may not be obvious if you are eligible for these funds from the information given in your application. You will be able to specify any funds you feel you are 'particularly eligible' for in your application. This is not compulsory but it will help us identify the most suitable funding for you.\nTo be considered for more funds by giving additional information \nYou can apply for other funds through the Applicant Portal that require you to complete extra fields within the form or upload an extra application form. These funds include: \n\nGates Cambridge Trust (see Gates website) - complete extra questions in the Applicant Portal and nominate a third reference.\nMedical Research Council (MRC) iCASE studentships - you will need to select from a list of available projects.\nNatural Environment Research Council (NERC) - choose a specific project from the NERC list and note this in the funding section of your application\nArts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) - complete and upload an extra form (available from the Open-Oxford-Cambridge website).\nSome department and College funds - you may need to 'opt-in' for funding in the Applicant Portal and fill out a separate application form. \n\nTo be considered for these funds, you will need to apply by the course funding deadline.  \nApplying via a separate form\nSome University funds may ask for a separate application form. This is because they are administered separately.\nThe Postgraduate Funding Search lists many of these funds. You should also check individual funding websites, including College and department websites.\nSome of the Cambridge Trust’s partners need you to submit a separate application form. You will still need to tick 'Yes - I wish to apply for funding’ in the Application Portal. Check the Cambridge Trust website for details.\nThe deadline for these separate funding applications may be different to your course funding deadline.\n\nCollege funding\nColleges at Cambridge offer some financial support to students but the majority of funding is not provided by them.\nMost College funding opportunities are listed in the Postgraduate Funding Search. You can also find College funding information on College websites.\nTo be eligible for College funding, many Colleges will ask you to select their College as a preference in your application. Some Colleges may still consider you for funding even if you did not select them. If you receive funding from a College, you must transfer to that College to accept the funding.\n\n\nAfter you apply\nAfter applying for funding:\n\nThe department will consider your complete application for admission.\nThe department will assess your funding application.\nYour application will be considered by the funding bodies for all the eligible funding opportunities you applied to and are eligible for.\n\nApplications that are missing one or both references are incomplete. The department will choose whether to consider incomplete applications for funding opportunities.\nFunding decisions\nOffers of funding and offers of admission are usually made separately.\nMost funding bodies start making offers from March. If you do not get a funding offer by July, you should assume your University funding application has not been successful. It’s unlikely that you will be given confirmation that your funding application was unsuccessful.\nContact the individual funding bodies for information on the status of your funding application.
