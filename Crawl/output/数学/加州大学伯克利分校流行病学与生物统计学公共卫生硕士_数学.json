Training emphasizes the development of skills applicable to the study of the occurrence and distribution of disease, focusing on determining the impact and magnitude of disease frequency so that effective control measures can be designed. Areas of study include the investigation of the natural history and clinical course of disease, as well as the study of statistical methods used to identify and evaluate risk factors associated with disease outcomes.\nOur two-year program’s course of study consists of 48 units. While generally devoting a substantial portion of course hours to topics in epidemiology and biostatistics, students have the opportunity to take additional courses in areas of interest to them and/or courses needed for their research.\nThe required capstone is a master’s research paper and presentation.\nGraduates are qualified for positions in federal, state and local health departments, as well as positions in academic research and in the private medical and health care fields. Some graduates decide to pursue doctoral studies in epidemiology or biostatistics.\n• Applicants have completed undergraduate course work in the biological, social or math sciences.\n• Common undergraduate majors for admitted applicants: Health, biological, natural, social and cognitive sciences.\n• Common work experience for admitted applicants: Volunteer work in public health, research assistants or lab technicians.\n• GRE scores are optional for the fall 2023 admissions cycle. We recommend submitting a GRE if you have no other evidence of quantitative, verbal, or analytical abilities in your application.\n[GRID_TABLE]\nJennifer Ahern, PhD, MPH\n\nProfessor, Epidemiology\nTomer Altman, PhD\n\nLecturer, Biostatistics\nLaura Balzer, PhD, MPhil\n\nAssociate Professor in Residence, Biostatistics\nLisa Barcellos, PhD, MPH\n\nProfessor, Epidemiology\nMichael Bates, PhD\n\nResearch Professor, Emeritus, Epidemiology and Environmental Health Sciences\nPatrick Bradshaw, PhD\n\nAssociate Professor, Epidemiology\nJohn Colford, MD, PhD, MPH\n\nProfessor, Epidemiology\nBrenda Eskenazi, MA, PhD\n\nProfessor Emerita, Epidemiology and Community Health Sciences\nRohini Haar, MD, MPH\n\nAssistant Adjunct Professor, Epidemiology\nAlan Hubbard, PhD\n\nProfessor, Biostatistics\nMi-Suk Kang Dufour, PhD, MDH\n\nAssociate Adjunct Professor, Biostatistics\nJoseph Lewnard, PhD\n\nAssociate Professor, Epidemiology\nJohn Marshall, PhD\n\nProfessor in Residence, Epidemiology and Biostatistics\nCatherine Metayer, MD, PhD\n\nAdjunct Professor, Epidemiology and Biostatistics\nMahasin Mujahid, PhD, MS, FAHA\n\nChair, Epidemiology Division\nMaya Petersen, MD, PhD\n\nProfessor, Epidemiology and Biostatistics\nArthur Reingold, MD\n\nProfessor, Epidemiology\nCorinne Riddell, PhD, MSc\n\nAssociate Adjunct Professor, Biostatistics\nSharon Sagiv, PhD, MPH\n\nAssociate Adjunct Professor, Epidemiology\nAlejandro Schuler, PhD\n\nAssistant Professor in Residence, Division of Biostatistics\n[CARD]\nApply Now",

Otherwise, return to the admissions landing page and select the appropriate link to access the admissions page for your intended program.\nThe School of Public Health’s minimum graduate admission requirements are defined below. More information can be found on the UC Berkeley Graduate Division website:\nAll applicants to our on-campus graduate degree programs must choose a degree program; applicants may apply to only one program and should tailor their applications to their program of choice. The coursework, application materials, and amount of work/research experience required by each program varies. Please thoroughly review the webpages for the program you are applying to for more guidance.\nWe recommend submitting a GRE if you have no other evidence of quantitative, verbal, or analytical abilities in your application.\nA writing sample. There is no length requirement for the writing sample, but a sample approximately 10 pages in length is typical. The writing sample may be a final paper from a class, a popular media article, a report, a blog entry, an undergraduate thesis, etc. The purpose of the writing sample is to demonstrate your preparation for graduate-level coursework and research at Berkeley by sharing an example of your prior work that exhibits your ability to articulate and support complex ideas, solve technical problems, construct and evaluate arguments, and/or sustain a focused and coherent discussion. The writing sample should be your own work; if there were multiple authors, please describe your specific contributions to the writing and project.\nSpecial note: The Epidemiology MS program admits about one to two students each year. Interested applicants are encouraged to also consider the Epidemiology and Biostatistics MPH program as the coursework is similar and that program admits a cohort of 20 to 25 students each year.\nApplicants must have a strong background in biological, social, or mathematical science, which will provide a basis for the application of epidemiological methods and principles to the study of diseases.\nCompleted undergraduate coursework in mathematics, biological sciences and/or, social sciences.\nA writing sample. Writing samples should be approximately 10 pages and highlight your writing and analytical skills. The writing sample may be a final paper from a class, a popular media article, a report, an undergraduate thesis, etc.\nCompleted at least one college-level mathematics or statistics course with at least a grade of B or equivalent, reflected on an official transcript.\nAll of our 11-month programs require that you have an advanced degree at the time of applying. For more information about our 11-month programs and what their specific requirements are, please go to the program page for the degree you are interested in.\nApplicants must be doctoral level health professionals (e.g. physicians, veterinarians, and dentists), have a prior doctoral degree in a related discipline (e.g. anthropology, sociology, psychology, demography, the biology sciences), or be concurrently enrolled in a doctoral level degree program in a health profession or related discipline.\nThe HPM 11-Month MPH program is paused and not accepting applications for 2025.\nMust be doctoral-level clinical students or graduates (MD, DDS, PharmD).\nHold a graduate degree (Master, PhD, MD, JD, DO, DVM etc.) or its academic equivalent from an accredited institution.\nBe a professional Registered Dietitian (RD) with at least 2 years of experience as an RD.\nFor information about this degree, which is available to UC Berkeley Public Health Majors and Alumni only, go to the “4+1” 11-month MPH program page.\nGRE scores are optional. We recommend submitting a GRE if you have no other evidence of quantitative, verbal, or analytical abilities in your application.\nThe dates and deadlines for the Summer/Fall 2026 on-campus application cycle are below.\nFor the on-campus graduate program, 11-month applicants are admitted for the summer term only. For all other on-campus programs, students are admitted for the fall term only. We do not accept applications on a rolling basis.\nSOPHAS applicants do not need to resubmit application materials and documents to their Berkeley Grad applications. Once the fee for the Berkeley Grad application has been paid and submitted, all of the materials you send through SOPHAS will be relayed over to your Berkeley Grad application. Please allow 3–4 business days for processing.\nThe SOPHAS Application will become available August 13. Visit sophas.aspph.org to make an account.\nIn order to submit a SOPHAS application, you will need to include a UC Berkeley Graduate Applicant ID, which won’t become available until\nSeptember 10. However, you may begin your SOPHAS application and prepare your supplemental materials.\nThe UC Berkeley Graduate Application is required for all applicants and will open on September 10.\nSOPHAS applicants will only be required to complete a truncated version of the form. You will need to submit your SOPHAS application first. Once you submit your SOPHAS application, you will receive an email prompting you to create your login for the supplemental UC Berkeley Application portal using a unique pin number.\nApplicants who apply by the priority deadline will be given the highest priority for admissions and consideration for scholarships and assistantships. This is the recommended deadline for all applicants.\nTo meet this priority deadline, Berkeley Public Health’s Admissions Office recommends you request test scores be sent by early October and submit your SOPHAS application in early November. This allows time for SOPHAS to process your application.\nWe will not penalize you for submitting your application on the last day of the deadline. However, we highly recommend that you submit your application earlier so you can resolve any technical difficulties and/or correct any errors found by SOPHAS (e.g. transcript discrepancies) before our first batch of applications are released for review.\nApplications submitted after December 1 will not be accepted, unless the program offers a secondary deadline (see below).\nIn the event that the following programs are not full*, applications will be accepted until March 2:\nIf your program/degree of interest is not listed above, it is not eligible for the secondary deadline.\n*Applying for the second round does not guarantee that your application will be reviewed. It will only be reviewed in the case that the program did not fill all of its slots in the priority round.\nNo, as long as you originally submitted your application by the deadline, your application will still be eligible for review. When your application is “undelivered,” that means that the SOPHAS verification team noticed some errors in the self-reported course entry portion of your application and/or there are other parts of your application that you need to fix. Address these issues and resubmit your application to SOPHAS as soon as possible so they can complete the verification process. Just make sure you follow their instructions and complete all of the requested tasks in a very timely manner and resubmit your application to SOPHAS. This will not change your original submission date.\nNo. As long as you have submitted your application by the deadline, it is okay if your application is in queue for verification and gets verified shortly after the deadline. Just be sure to regularly check your application to ensure all of your supplemental materials have arrived. If all of your supplemental materials have not arrived, follow up to make sure they arrive in a timely manner so this submission process does not impact your verification period. It is your responsibility to ensure your application is complete and ready for review.\nWe will still review your application as long as your letters of recommendation, test scores, and transcripts or transcript evaluations are received by December 16.\nIf you are unsure if your program is SOPHAS or non-SOPHAS, you can find out on the admissions landing page and select the appropriate link for your intended program.\nYou can only apply to one program per admissions cycle. All programs except for those listed in red below require two separate applications to SOPHAS and UC Berkeley. Both applications must be completed and submitted before your file is considered complete and ready for review. Incomplete application files or late applications (submitted after the December 4 deadline) will not be reviewed.\nBoth the SOPHAS and UC Berkeley Graduate application must be submitted by the deadline to be considered for admission and awards (no separate application process is necessary for award consideration). Late applications will not be accepted.\nTo avoid delays in processing, use the same email address for your SOPHAS and UC Berkeley applications if possible and make sure you apply to the same program in both systems.\nSubmit an online application to SOPHAS with the following items:\nIf you are applying to more than one school in SOPHAS and they have different deadlines, enter only the school(s) with the earliest deadline, and then complete and submit the application. To apply to additional schools, you may add another school designation to your existing application and fill out the program materials section for that specific program. If you have questions, please contact the SOPHAS customer support department directly.\nIf you have completed the application but are waiting on any supplemental materials, (e.g. letters of recommendation, GRE scores, transcripts, etc.), you can still submit your application and should do so by the application deadline. It is acceptable for supplemental materials to be submitted a few days after the deadline.\nWhile there is a small grace period for supplemental materials to be submitted, you need to submit your application by the application deadline—otherwise your application will be considered late and ineligible for review.\nAccess the SOPHAS Application at sophas.aspph.org.\nOnce you submit your SOPHAS application, you will receive an email with instructions to create a login for the mandatory supplemental UC Berkeley Graduate Application portal. The supplemental application portal costs $100 and there are fee waivers available for individuals who meet the eligibility criteria. Completion of this step is required in order for your application to be complete and reviewed.\nThe cost for a SOPHAS application is $145 for the first school or program to which you apply. Any additional schools or programs to which you choose to apply will cost $55 per designation, even if you submit those schools or programs later in the application cycle.\nThe cost for the supplemental UC Berkeley Graduate Application is $100 for all SOPHAS applicants. Payments should be submitted by credit card only.\nIf you would like to request a fee waiver, you must reach out to SOPHAS and the UC Berkeley Graduate Division. Please see the following links for more information.\nYou must submit electronic transcripts to both SOPHAS and to UC Berkeley.\nInternational Students: Please see more information about international student transcripts in the “Additional Application Instructions for International Students” section of this page.\nFor application review purposes only, include copies of transcripts for all of the post-secondary institutions you attended, including study abroad institutions in the Berkeley Graduate Application. During the online application process, you will be prompted to upload scanned documents. Uploaded transcripts should be recent and include the following:\nNote: Official transcripts will be requested if you are admitted and then decide to attend UC Berkeley\nPlease do not send any paper transcripts to Berkeley Public Health—any unsolicited materials will be destroyed.\nThe GRE is optional for the majority of our programs. See our GRE requirement chart to see a summary of each program’s requirement.\nFor programs that require the GRE, the current GRE Exemption Policy for these applicants will still hold. Applications to these programs will not be considered complete and will not be reviewed by Berkeley Public Health’s Admissions Committee without the required test scores.\nApplicants who have completed a MD, PhD or equivalent doctoral-level degree at the time of application from an accredited institution are not required to submit GRE scores.\nStudents currently enrolled in medical, dental, optometry, business, or law school can submit their MCAT, DAT, OAT, GMAT, or LSAT scores, respectively, in lieu of the GRE. Other professional school exams will not be eligible as alternatives to the GRE exam.\nApplicants who have completed a MBBS degree and have passed the Step 1 and Step 2 of the USMLE are not required to submit GRE scores. In order to be eligible for the GRE waiver, copies of both official USMLE scores will be required to be uploaded with your application.\nWe do not have a minimum GRE score as we review applications holistically; however, competitive applicants tend to score in the 50th percentile and above. Many program pages include the average GRE scores of admitted students for that specific program.\nNote: Since an official GRE score report should only be submitted to SOPHAS, it will not show as received on your UC Berkeley application. You only need to confirm receipt of your GRE scores on your SOPHAS application.\nThe SOPHAS Application will contain a text box for you to write a short answer response to a question on your quantitative and analytical abilities. The question has a word limit of 250 words.\nPlease indicate your achievements in obtaining verbal, quantitative, and analytical writing skills that prepare you for the specific program to which you are applying. This can be completed coursework, such as undergraduate or post-baccalaureate math/stats or epidemiology/biostatistics courses, quantitative research, programming, data analysis, or evaluation experience, verbal/writing strengths such as professional publications and/or presentations, etc.\nNote: you may also submit a writing sample, publication, or other documents that demonstrate the above skills in the “Documents” section of the application.\nBerkeley Public Health’s Admissions Committee requires a minimum of three letters of recommendation be submitted electronically to SOPHAS with your SOPHAS application. We recommend that you request that your letter writers use an official letterhead.\nTypically, we recommend you have at least one letter of recommendation from an academic and two from individuals who can evaluate your professional experience. However, please thoroughly look at the requirements and qualifications of the program you are applying to for more guidance. Overall, it will be in your best interest to have three individuals who can attest to your academic and/or professional ability to succeed in a public health career.\nFor academic references, we recommend you ask professors who you think will write the strongest recommendations. A strong quality letter attesting to your ability to succeed in the program will weigh more than a generic letter from a high-ranking professor.\nBerkeley Public Health does not accept hard-copy letters sent to our offices.\nApplications should include a resume or CV. Prior work experience, preferably in health sector related activities, is required for some programs.\nResumes should include:\nWord limit: 1,000 words\nYour Statement of Purpose should explain why you are pursuing graduate training in public health. Your essay should also explain your eventual career goals and why you need a degree in your specific program. You can choose to explain why you are pursuing this degree now and why at Berkeley Public Health. If you are applying to a doctoral program, include your proposed research topics. Please be sure to check your program’s page, as some programs have specific questions to answer. If there are no specific program guidelines, please follow the above-mentioned general guidelines.\nHere are some best practices from the DREAM Office and the UC Berkeley Graduate Division on how to write the statement of purpose.\nWord limit: 1,000 words\nYour Personal History Statement gives you an opportunity to add some individuality and depth to the information provided in your Statement of Purpose. Your Personal History Statement can include information about who you are as a person, your family background, cultural background, socioeconomic status, educational advantages and/or experiences growing up. It is intended to give you the opportunity to provide a narrative about your diverse personal experiences. It is important to be concise and impactful by focusing on a specific part of your life experience.\nYou may also use the personal history statement to describe any impacts the COVID-19 pandemic may have had on you, such as your academics, obtaining employment, or pursuing public health experiences. We understand that there may be downstream effects of the pandemic on your ability to meet criteria for admission that is beyond your control. Use this essay to provide context on your other application materials, and elaborate on anything that may be helpful for the admissions committee to be aware of.\nHere are some best practices from the DREAM Office and the UC Berkeley Graduate Division on how to write the personal history statement.\nInternational applicants should apply early in order to allow sufficient time for financial and visa document preparation.\nIf you are an international applicant who obtained a bachelor’s degree in the United States or an English-speaking Canadian institution, then you only need to submit the materials described in the previous sections.\nIf you are an international applicant who obtained a bachelor’s degree from a non-US or non-English-speaking Canadian institution, then please submit the additional materials below.\nAll applicants who attended college in a country/region in which the official language is not English are required to submit official evidence of English language proficiency via a TOEFL or IELTS score, regardless of whether or not English was the primary language of instruction at your college. This requirement applies to applicants from Bangladesh, Nepal, India, Pakistan, Latin America, the Middle East, Israel, the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan, Japan, Korea, Southeast Asia, most European countries, and non-English-speaking countries in Africa.\nWe recommend that you plan to take any required exams no later than October to allow time for scores to arrive in time for consideration for fall admission.\nFor Summer/Fall 2026, tests taken before June 1, 2024 will not be accepted even if your score was reported to UC Berkeley.\nThe USMLE and other similar exams are not approved substitutes for the TOEFL.\nYou may be exempt from this requirement if you:\nIf you qualify for an exemption, you must upload an unofficial transcript from the recognized U.S. institution to your Berkeley Graduate Application. If you are unsure if your country of education qualifies you for a TOEFL exemption, please contact us at sphadmit@berkeley.edu.\nScores below the minimum will require an exception request\nOfficial TOEFL test scores administered by the Educational Testing Service (ETS) must be submitted to UC Berkeley (code 4833). We do not accept MyBest Scores.\nBeginning for the Fall 2022 application cycle, we will no longer be accepting paper Test Report Forms. All IELTS scores must be sent electronically from the testing center, no institution code is required, directly to UC Berkeley.\nOur address for identification purposes is:\nUniversity of California, Berkeley, Graduate Division\nSproul Hall Rm 318, MC 5900\nBerkeley, CA 94720\nPlease do not mail any score reports to us.\nGraduates of recognized academic institutions outside the United States should hold a degree equivalent to a U.S. bachelor’s degree. Equivalency is determined by International Evaluators in the Graduate Admissions Office. If you are unsure if your degree is equivalent to a U.S. bachelor’s degree, you can email us at sphadmit@berkeley.edu.\nOfficial World Education Services (WES) ICAP Evaluations of international transcripts are required to be sent to SOPHAS. SOPHAS will not accept any foreign transcripts or translated foreign transcripts; only an evaluation for U.S. equivalency via WES will be accepted.\nWe require a WES ICAP course-by-course evaluation which costs $208 (fees subject to change). It should be sent directly to your SOPHAS application, not to Berkeley Public Health.\nPlease do not send any materials to Berkeley Public Health—any unsolicited materials will be destroyed.\nPlease upload copies of unofficial or official foreign transcripts and degrees to the UC Berkeley Graduate application. Academic records should:\nOfficial transcripts or academic records for all university-level studies you have completed abroad will be required to be re-submitted directly to UC Berkeley if admitted. Although SOPHAS accepts WES evaluations, UC Berkeley does not accept WES evaluations for matriculation purposes.\nWe are unable to provide international applicant fee waivers for the UC Berkeley Graduate Application at this time. AB540 students may apply for the fee waiver if they meet the eligibility criteria. Please contact the Graduate Admissions Office at gradadm@berkeley.edu for instructions.\nSOPHAS offers fee waivers for international applicants from select countries.

This allows time for SOPHAS to process your application.\nWe will not penalize you for submitting your application on the last day of the deadline.

Will that impact my application submission date?\n\nNo, as long as you originally submitted your application by the deadline, your application will still be eligible for review. When your application is “undelivered,” that means that the SOPHAS verification team noticed some errors in the self-reported course entry portion of your application and/or there are other parts of your application that you need to fix. Address these issues and resubmit your application to SOPHAS as soon as possible so they can complete the verification process. Just make sure you follow their instructions and complete all of the requested tasks in a very timely manner and resubmit your application to SOPHAS. This will not change your original submission date.\n• Does my application have to be verified by the application deadline?\n\nNo. As long as you have submitted your application by the deadline, it is okay if your application is in queue for verification and gets verified shortly after the deadline. Just be sure to regularly check your application to ensure all of your supplemental materials have arrived. If all of your supplemental materials have not arrived, follow up to make sure they arrive in a timely manner so this submission process does not impact your verification period. It is your responsibility to ensure your application is complete and ready for review.\n• I submitted my application by the deadline but some of my supplemental materials (like letters of recommendation or test scores) have not yet been received by SOPHAS. Will you still review my application?\n\nWe will still review your application as long as your letters of recommendation, test scores, and transcripts or transcript evaluations are received by December 16.\n• Application checklist for applicants with a Bachelors Degree from the US or English-speaking Canadian Institutions\n\n\nSOPHAS Application fee or fee waiver\nSupplemental UC Berkeley Graduate Application + $100 fee or fee waiver\nCV or Resume\nStatement of Purpose\nPersonal History Statement\nThree Letters of Recommendation from a combination of professional and academic recommenders\nTranscripts from each institution you have attended\nOfficial GRE test score, if applicable\nSubmit by December 1 at 8:59pm PST\n• SOPHAS Application fee or fee waiver\n• Supplemental UC Berkeley Graduate Application + $100 fee or fee waiver\n• CV or Resume\n• Statement of Purpose\n• Personal History Statement\n• Three Letters of Recommendation from a combination of professional and academic recommenders\n• Transcripts from each institution you have attended\n• Official GRE test score, if applicable\n• Submit by December 1 at 8:59pm PST\n• Application checklist for applicants with a non-US bachelor's degree\n\n\nSOPHAS Application fee or fee waiver\nSupplemental UC Berkeley Graduate Application + $100 fee or fee waiver\nCV or Resume\nStatement of Purpose\nPersonal History Statement\nThree Letters of Recommendation from a combination of professional and academic recommenders\nWES ICAP ($208) course-by-course evaluation of international transcripts sent to SOPHAS\nTranscripts and/or degree certificates from each institution you have attended uploaded to Berkeley Graduate Application\nOfficial GRE test score, if applicable\nOfficial TOEFL or IELTS test score, if applicable\nSubmit by December 1 at 8:59pm PST\nScroll to the bottom of this page for additional instructions about the required materials for international applicants.\n• SOPHAS Application fee or fee waiver\n• Supplemental UC Berkeley Graduate Application + $100 fee or fee waiver\n• CV or Resume\n• Statement of Purpose\n• Personal History Statement\n• Three Letters of Recommendation from a combination of professional and academic recommenders\n• WES ICAP ($208) course-by-course evaluation of international transcripts sent to SOPHAS\n• Transcripts and/or degree certificates from each institution you have attended uploaded to Berkeley Graduate Application\n• Official GRE test score, if applicable\n• Official TOEFL or IELTS test score, if applicable\n• Submit by December 1 at 8:59pm PST\n• Scroll to the bottom of this page for additional instructions about the required materials for international applicants.\n• SOPHAS Application fee or fee waiver\n• Supplemental UC Berkeley Graduate Application + $100 fee or fee waiver\n• CV or Resume\n• Statement of Purpose\n• Personal History Statement\n• Three Letters of Recommendation from a combination of professional and academic recommenders\n• Transcripts from each institution you have attended\n• Official GRE test score, if applicable\n• Submit by December 1 at 8:59pm PST\n• SOPHAS Application fee or fee waiver\n• Supplemental UC Berkeley Graduate Application + $100 fee or fee waiver\n• CV or Resume\n• Statement of Purpose\n• Personal History Statement\n• Three Letters of Recommendation from a combination of professional and academic recommenders\n• WES ICAP ($208) course-by-course evaluation of international transcripts sent to SOPHAS\n• Transcripts and/or degree certificates from each institution you have attended uploaded to Berkeley Graduate Application\n• Official GRE test score, if applicable\n• Official TOEFL or IELTS test score, if applicable\n• Submit by December 1 at 8:59pm PST\n• Scroll to the bottom of this page for additional instructions about the required materials for international applicants.\n• How to Submit a SOPHAS Application\n\nSubmit an online application to SOPHAS with the following items:\n\nCV or Resume,\nStatement of Purpose,\nPersonal History Statement,\nThree Letters of Recommendation (letters of recommendation must be submitted electronically),\nOne set of official transcripts from each institution you have attended,\nOfficial GRE test score sent to SOPHAS only, if applicable (code 4227),\nOfficial TOEFL test score sent to SOPHAS, if applicable (code 5688),\nInclude your Berkeley Graduate Reference number in the SOPHAS application,\nSOPHAS application fee or fee waiver.\n\nIf you are applying to more than one school in SOPHAS and they have different deadlines, enter only the school(s) with the earliest deadline, and then complete and submit the application.

Applications to these programs will not be considered complete and will not be reviewed by Berkeley Public Health’s Admissions Committee without the required test scores.\nGRE Exemption Policy\nApplicants who have completed a MD, PhD or equivalent doctoral-level degree at the time of application from an accredited institution are not required to submit GRE scores.\nStudents currently enrolled in medical, dental, optometry, business, or law school can submit their MCAT, DAT, OAT, GMAT, or LSAT scores, respectively, in lieu of the GRE. Other professional school exams will not be eligible as alternatives to the GRE exam.\nApplicants who have completed a MBBS degree and have passed the Step 1 and Step 2 of the USMLE are not required to submit GRE scores. In order to be eligible for the GRE waiver, copies of both official USMLE scores will be required to be uploaded with your application.\nMinimum GRE Scores\nWe do not have a minimum GRE score as we review applications holistically; however, competitive applicants tend to score in the 50th percentile and above. Many program pages include the average GRE scores of admitted students for that specific program.\nHow to submit scores\n\nWhile you can take your exam as late as the date of the deadline, we recommend that you plan to take your exam no later than October to allow time for scores to arrive in time for consideration for fall admission.\nAt-home test scores are acceptable.\nAll applicants who submit GRE test scores must send official scores through ETS directly to SOPHAS only. To send an official GRE score report to SOPHAS, please use code 4227.\nScores must be from within 5 years of the test date for them to be considered valid. In order to apply, you must retake the test if your scores are more than five years old.\nWhen completing the UC Berkeley supplemental graduate application, do not indicate that you intend to submit GRE scores even if you will, as those should be sent to SOPHAS only.\n\nNote: Since an official GRE score report should only be submitted to SOPHAS, it will not show as received on your UC Berkeley application. You only need to confirm receipt of your GRE scores on your SOPHAS application.\n• While you can take your exam as late as the date of the deadline, we recommend that you plan to take your exam no later than October to allow time for scores to arrive in time for consideration for fall admission.\n• At-home test scores are acceptable.\n• All applicants who submit GRE test scores must send official scores through ETS directly to SOPHAS only.

The question has a word limit of 250 words.\nPlease indicate your achievements in obtaining verbal, quantitative, and analytical writing skills that prepare you for the specific program to which you are applying. This can be completed coursework, such as undergraduate or post-baccalaureate math/stats or epidemiology/biostatistics courses, quantitative research, programming, data analysis, or evaluation experience, verbal/writing strengths such as professional publications and/or presentations, etc.\nNote: you may also submit a writing sample, publication, or other documents that demonstrate the above skills in the “Documents” section of the application.\n• Letters of Recommendation\n\nBerkeley Public Health’s Admissions Committee requires a minimum of three letters of recommendation be submitted electronically to SOPHAS with your SOPHAS application. We recommend that you request that your letter writers use an official letterhead.\nTypically, we recommend you have at least one letter of recommendation from an academic and two from individuals who can evaluate your professional experience. However, please thoroughly look at the requirements and qualifications of the program you are applying to for more guidance. Overall, it will be in your best interest to have three individuals who can attest to your academic and/or professional ability to succeed in a public health career.\nFor academic references, we recommend you ask professors who you think will write the strongest recommendations. A strong quality letter attesting to your ability to succeed in the program will weigh more than a generic letter from a high-ranking professor.\nBerkeley Public Health does not accept hard-copy letters sent to our offices.\n• CV/Resume\n\nApplications should include a resume or CV. Prior work experience, preferably in health sector related activities, is required for some programs.\nResumes should include:\n\nEducational degrees\nEmployment\nExperiences (especially those that are public-health related)\nProfessional skills and accomplishments\nVolunteer activities (specify any leadership roles)\n• Educational degrees\n• Employment\n• Experiences (especially those that are public-health related)\n• Professional skills and accomplishments\n• Volunteer activities (specify any leadership roles)\n• Essays: Statement of Purpose and Personal History Statement\n\nStatement of Purpose\nWord limit: 1,000 words\nYour Statement of Purpose should explain why you are pursuing graduate training in public health.

You can choose to explain why you are pursuing this degree now and why at Berkeley Public Health. If you are applying to a doctoral program, include your proposed research topics. Please be sure to check your program’s page, as some programs have specific questions to answer. If there are no specific program guidelines, please follow the above-mentioned general guidelines.\nHere are some best practices from the DREAM Office and the UC Berkeley Graduate Division on how to write the statement of purpose.\nPersonal History Statement\nWord limit: 1,000 words\nYour Personal History Statement gives you an opportunity to add some individuality and depth to the information provided in your Statement of Purpose. Your Personal History Statement can include information about who you are as a person, your family background, cultural background, socioeconomic status, educational advantages and/or experiences growing up. It is intended to give you the opportunity to provide a narrative about your diverse personal experiences. It is important to be concise and impactful by focusing on a specific part of your life experience.\nYou may also use the personal history statement to describe any impacts the COVID-19 pandemic may have had on you, such as your academics, obtaining employment, or pursuing public health experiences. We understand that there may be downstream effects of the pandemic on your ability to meet criteria for admission that is beyond your control.
