You’ll choose one as the core of your study plan, but you’re also free to explore topics across specialisations or beyond—into fields like physics, logic, econometrics, or quantum computing.\nEach specialisation includes a dedicated Master Seminar, where you'll connect with researchers, explore current developments, and present your own work. While your specialisation offers structure and focus, the programme remains highly customisable—allowing you to shape your curriculum around the topics and questions that excite you most.\nThe MSc Mathematics is a two-year, 120 EC programme designed to give you both depth and flexibility. You’ll follow a structured curriculum within your specialisation, while also having the freedom to explore topics across mathematical fields or even beyond.\nYour curriculum consists of the following components:\nYou will follow five or six advanced courses aligned with your chosen specialisation. These courses provide a solid foundation in your area of focus and often connect directly to current research themes.\nEach specialisation includes a Master Seminar, led by researchers from the field. You'll attend research talks, study and present mathematical literature, and gain early exposure to the collaborative nature of academic research. These seminars also include guest lectures from alumni and potential employers and encourage reflection on the role of mathematics in society—including sessions on ethics in mathematics.\nThe elective space allows you to broaden or deepen your expertise. You may take additional courses from your specialisation, choose courses from the other specialisations, or select relevant courses from related Master's programmes—such as Physics, Econometrics, Logic, or Quantum Computer Science. Many of these are offered through MasterMath, while others are local UvA courses taught by researchers at the Korteweg-de Vries Institute.\nYou’ll complete your degree with a substantial research project under the guidance of a UvA researcher (or affiliated partner such as CWI or QuSoft). This includes writing a thesis and giving a final presentation. The project is your opportunity to explore a topic in depth and make an original contribution—whether theoretical, computational, or interdisciplinary.\nThroughout the programme, you’ll receive personal guidance from your master coordinator and have the chance to adjust your study plan to reflect your evolving interests. Whether you want to prepare for a PhD, a career in industry, or a role in education, the curriculum is designed to help you build a coherent and meaningful academic journey.\nFor detailed information regarding the curriculum and courses, please see the UvA Course Catalogue.\nAs a student in Amsterdam, you benefit from full access to the MasterMath network—a unique national consortium that brings together mathematics departments from ten Dutch universities. Through MasterMath, you can choose from an extensive catalogue of advanced Master’s and PhD-level courses, taught by leading experts in the field.\nCourses take place at centrally located universities—many just a short train ride from Amsterdam—and offer a chance to connect with students and lecturers from across the country. Topics range from foundational theory to highly specialised subjects, making it possible to tailor your studies with exceptional precision.\nIn addition to MasterMath, you’ll follow local courses taught at UvA, often by faculty members from the Korteweg-de Vries Institute for Mathematics. These courses are typically smaller in scale and exclusive to UvA students—making them ideal for building connections with your peers and with the researchers who may later supervise your Master’s thesis.\nLocal courses often reflect the latest research developments in Amsterdam and are carefully aligned with each specialisation. They contribute to the local signature of the programme, fostering a strong sense of academic community and cohort identity.\nTogether, the MasterMath and UvA courses give you the best of both worlds: access to the full spectrum of mathematical expertise in the Netherlands, and a close-knit academic home in one of Europe’s most dynamic science hubs.\nYour final year culminates in an in-depth Master’s research project (36 EC), where you'll investigate a mathematical topic under the guidance of a UvA faculty member or affiliated researcher. This is your opportunity to contribute original insights, explore advanced ideas, and experience what it means to do mathematics at a professional level.\nThe research project takes place within one of the research groups at the Korteweg-de Vries Institute for Mathematics (KdVI), or in collaboration with partner institutes such as CWI or QuSoft. These partnerships offer unique access to expertise in areas like quantum information, cryptography, mathematical modelling, and optimisation. Many students are co-supervised by researchers from these institutes, gaining valuable exposure to academic or applied research environments.\nAlongside your independent research, you’ll present your work in progress during a Master Seminar, receive feedback, and engage in peer discussions. Your project concludes with the writing of your Master’s thesis and a final presentation to your supervisor, an independent reviewer, and the academic community.\nWhether your aim is to continue into a PhD, move into industry, or apply your mathematical skills in new domains, the Master’s project is a defining part of your academic journey—developing your ability to think deeply, work independently, and communicate complex ideas with clarity and confidence.\nAmbitious students with broad interests have the opportunity to pursue a double degree, combining the MSc Mathematics with another Master's programme at UvA.

Many students are co-supervised by researchers from these institutes, gaining valuable exposure to academic or applied research environments. \nAlongside your independent research, you’ll present your work in progress during a Master Seminar, receive feedback, and engage in peer discussions. Your project concludes with the writing of your Master’s thesis and a final presentation to your supervisor, an independent reviewer, and the academic community. \nWhether your aim is to continue into a PhD, move into industry, or apply your mathematical skills in new domains, the Master’s project is a defining part of your academic journey—developing your ability to think deeply, work independently, and communicate complex ideas with clarity and confidence. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee examples of recent Master's theses\nDouble degree programmes\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nAmbitious students with broad interests have the opportunity to pursue a double degree, combining the MSc Mathematics with another Master's programme at UvA. These integrated study paths allow you to earn two degrees with reduced overlap—offering an efficient and intellectually rewarding academic experience. \nIn both double degree options, you benefit from interdisciplinary guidance, an expanded professional network, and the opportunity to explore connections between mathematical theory and its applications in other domains. \nMathematics and Econometrics\nThis programme enables you to earn both the 120 EC MSc Mathematics and the 60 EC MSc Econometrics by completing a joint curriculum of just 150 EC. The combination is especially appealing to students interested in data science, finance, or economic modelling.
