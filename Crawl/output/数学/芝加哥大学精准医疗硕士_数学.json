This program will prepare you to tackle the most challenging biological, behavioral, and economic problems at the forefront of medicine and population health.\nThe curriculum includes foundational courses in epidemiology, biostatistics, bioinformatics, ethics, and precision healthcare, plus additional coursework in an area of concentration. This distinctive training equips students with the ability to better prevent disease, promote health, and reduce health disparities across communities.\nThe University of Chicago’s Master of Science in Precision Health program broadly trains students in the fields of genetics, biomedical informatics, data science, and communication, making them competitive for a number of careers in the precision and population health workforce. As the field of precision health continues to grow, so does the demand for highly trained professionals.\nLearn from leading precision medicine experts in the Institute for Population and Precision Health at UChicago. The IPPH is an interdisciplinary center that was founded in 2018 and brings together experts from across the University to tackle the most challenging biological, behavioral, and economic problems in preventive and population medicine.  As a community of scholars, clinicians, and researchers, we actively seek to push the boundaries of biological and medical discovery.\n• Apply Now\n• Request More Information\n[GRID_TABLE]\nApply Now\nRequest More Information",
