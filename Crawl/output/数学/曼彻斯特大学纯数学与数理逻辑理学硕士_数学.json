Or perhaps you wish to improve you background knowledge prior to applying for a PhD by research in this area?\nIf either of the above statements apply, this could be the course for you.\nThis one year taught postgraduate programme is a pathway from the MSc in Pure Mathematics and leads to the degree of MSc in Pure Mathematics and Mathematical Logic. You may, at any point, switch to the MSc in Pure Mathematics.\nThe MSc comprises of the taught component, running from the start of the academic year in September until the end of the second semester in late spring, followed by the dissertation component running from June until September.\nDuring the taught component of the course, you will normally take six units together with a research skills and project unit. On the MSc in Pure Mathematics and Mathematical Logic Pathway, you would take the logic units and some pure mathematics units.\nIn the research skills and project unit you will first complete a mini-project to improve mathematical writing skills, and then undertake a project. The project is normally an expository account of a piece of mathematics and you will write this under the guidance of a supervisor.\nThe taught component comprises of conventional lectures supported by examples classes, project work and independent learning via reading material.\nAfter successfully completing the taught component, you will prepare a dissertation on an advanced topic in mathematical logic, normally of current or recent research interest, chosen in consultation with your supervisor.\nWe supervise projects and dissertations in a variety of areas of pure mathematics and beyond. These include (but are not limited to): noncommutative algebra, representation theory, algebraic geometry, group theory, category theory, logic, number theory, ergodic theory, dynamical systems, geometric group theory, combinatorics, semigroups, differential geometry, and also subjects connected to probability.\nYou can also take the programme part-time, over a period of two years. There is some flexibility in the precise arrangements for this programme, but you would normally attend two lecture courses each semester for three semesters before commencing work on your dissertation.\nWithin two weeks from the start of the academic year, students in this programme can opt to change to the MSc in Pure Mathematics.\nFor  entry in the academic year beginning September 2025, the tuition fees are as follows:\nFurther information for EU students can be found on our dedicated EU page.\nThe fees quoted above will be fully inclusive for the course tuition, administration and computational costs during your studies.\nAll fees for entry will be subject to yearly review and incremental rises per annum are also likely over the duration of courses lasting more than a year for UK/EU students (fees are typically fixed for International students, for the course duration at the year of entry). For general fees information please visit:         postgraduate fees\n. Always contact the department if you are unsure which fee applies to your qualification award and method of attendance.\nSelf-funded international applicants for this course will be required to pay a deposit of £1000 towards their tuition fees before a confirmation of acceptance for studies (CAS) is issued. This deposit will only be refunded if immigration permission is refused. We will notify you about how and when to make this payment.\nAll students should normally be able to complete their programme of study without incurring additional study costs over and above the tuition fee for that programme. Any unavoidable additional compulsory costs totalling more than 1% of the annual home undergraduate fee per annum, regardless of whether the programme in question is undergraduate or postgraduate taught, will be made clear to you at the point of application. Further information can be found in the University's Policy on additional costs incurred by students on undergraduate and postgraduate taught programmes (PDF document, 91KB).\nAcross our institution, we offer a number of postgraduate taught scholarships and awards to outstanding UK and international students each year.

Or perhaps you wish to improve you background knowledge prior to applying for a PhD by research in this area?\nIf either of the above statements apply, this could be the course for you.\nThis one year taught postgraduate programme is a pathway from the MSc in Pure Mathematics and leads to the degree of MSc in Pure Mathematics and Mathematical Logic. You may, at any point, switch to the MSc in Pure Mathematics.\nThe MSc comprises of the taught component, running from the start of the academic year in September until the end of the second semester in late spring, followed by the dissertation component running from June until September.\nDuring the taught component of the course, you will normally take six units together with a research skills and project unit. On the MSc in Pure Mathematics and Mathematical Logic Pathway, you would take the logic units and some pure mathematics units.\nIn the research skills and project unit you will first complete a mini-project to improve mathematical writing skills, and then undertake a project. The project is normally an expository account of a piece of mathematics and you will write this under the guidance of a supervisor.\nThe taught component comprises of conventional lectures supported by examples classes, project work and independent learning via reading material.\nAfter successfully completing the taught component, you will prepare a dissertation on an advanced topic in mathematical logic, normally of current or recent research interest, chosen in consultation with your supervisor.\nWe supervise projects and dissertations in a variety of areas of pure mathematics and beyond. These include (but are not limited to): noncommutative algebra, representation theory, algebraic geometry, group theory, category theory, logic, number theory, ergodic theory, dynamical systems, geometric group theory, combinatorics, semigroups, differential geometry, and also subjects connected to probability.\nYou can also take the programme part-time, over a period of two years. There is some flexibility in the precise arrangements for this programme, but you would normally attend two lecture courses each semester for three semesters before commencing work on your dissertation.\nWithin two weeks from the start of the academic year, students in this programme can opt to change to the MSc in Pure Mathematics.\nThe aims of the programme are to provide training in a range of topics related to pure mathematics and mathematical logic, to encourage a sophisticated and critical approach to mathematics, and to prepare students who have the ability and desire to follow careers as professional mathematicians and logicians in industry or research.\nThe taught component is assessed by coursework, project work and by written examination.  The written exams take place at the end of January (for the first semester course units) and the end of May (for the second semester course units).  The dissertation component is assessed by the quality and competence of the written dissertation.\nThe Postgraduate Diploma and Postgraduate Certificate exist as exit awards for students who do not pass at MSc level.\nThe course unit details given below are subject to change, and are the latest example of the curriculum available on this course of study.\nAcross our institution, we offer a number of postgraduate taught scholarships and awards to outstanding UK and international students each year. We are one of the Martingale Foundation's newest university partners. The Martingale Foundation helps provide access to postgraduate mathematics study for UK students facing financial barriers by offering fully-funded MSc and PhD programmes. Information about eligibility can be found at the         Martingale Foundation website\n and applications will open on 13 August 2025. The deadline to apply is Sunday 19 October 2025.\nThe University of Manchester is committed to widening participation in master's study, and allocates £300,000 in funding each year. Our         Manchester Masters Bursaries\n are aimed at widening access to master's courses by removing barriers to postgraduate education for students from underrepresented groups.\nFor more information, see the Department of Mathematics         Fees and funding\n page or visit the University of Manchester         funding for master's courses\n website for more information.\nIf you are a sponsored student please check the requirements of your sponsorship before registering on a course.
