Based in Warren Weaver Hall, at the heart of New York University’s Washington Square campus, it is one of the top-ranked Mathematics departments worldwide (#4 in the US and #9 in the world as per the Shanghai rankings; #6 in the US and #8 in the world as per the QS rankings).\nFor more on the Courant Institute and its pioneering history in the field of applied mathematics (our department is consistently ranked #1 in applied mathematics as per USNews), see the history page.\nThe study of mathematics can lead to a variety of exciting professional careers. Basic research, engineering, finance, business, and government service are among the opportunities open to those with mathematical training.  Moreover, with the increasing importance of basic science and information technology, prospects for careers in the mathematical sciences are very good. Mathematical analysis and computational modeling are important for solving some of the most pressing problems of our time - new energy resources, climate change, risk management, epidemiology, to name a few. We must strive to maintain our technological edge; mathematical skills will be crucial to this effort.\nSome more specific business positions include portfolio analysis, design studies, statistical analysis, computer simulation, software design and testing, and other areas of operations research. There are extensive opportunities for mathematics in finance, the actuarial fields, and economic forecasting.\nMany laboratories, both government and private, maintain independent research staffs that include mathematicians. Their work often deals with the development of new technology, including research in basic physics and software development, as well as applied mathematics. Numerical simulation, such as weather and climate forecasting, depends heavily on the use of supercomputers.\nPractical considerations aside, there is the pleasure of learning, applying, and creating mathematics. Real world issues pose problems that can be studied by formulating and analyzing mathematical models. In some cases applications may lead to new mathematics, and a new branch of the science is born. In other cases abstract theory finds unexpected practical purpose. Working on research problems is exciting; solving difficult problems successfully is, for many, satisfaction enough.\nAll applicants to the Graduate School of Arts and Science (GSAS) are required to submit the general application requirements, which include:\nSee Mathematics for admission requirements and instructions specific to this program.\nThe program requires either 36 credits of coursework and a grade of at least B on the written comprehensive examination, or 32 credits of coursework and a master’s thesis completed under the supervision of a faculty member and approved by the department. Under both options, students may be able to transfer up to 8 credits (usually equivalent to two CIMS courses) from other academic institution.\nMaster’s students who choose the Written Comprehensive Examinations option must pass with an overall grade of B. The three-part Written Comprehensive Examination is administered by the department twice a year in early September and early January. Most Master's students tend to take the exam toward the end of their graduate studies.\nStudents who have earned a GPA of 3.7 or higher and taken at least 18 credits in the program have the option to write a Master's thesis under the supervision of a Mathematics faculty member. In certain cases involving interdisciplinary research, a second advisor outside the Department of Mathematics may be approved by the Director of Graduate Studies. All students must submit the Thesis Proposal and Advisor Approval form, outlining the research plan for the thesis which has been approved by the thesis advisor, to the Program Administrator at least four months prior to the graduation date. The completed Master's thesis must be approved by two readers -- the thesis advisor and a second reader. At least one of the readers must be a full-time Courant Mathematics faculty member. You can find more detailed information in the Thesis Guidelines FAQ.\nThe master’s degree in mathematics encompasses the basic graduate curriculum in mathematics, and offers the opportunity of some more specialized training in an area of interest.

The GSAS web site also has instructions and links to the most frequently asked questions and verification about receipt of applications.\nThe rules and regulations governing admissions to NYU's Graduate School of Arts and Science must be met by all applicants seeking admission to graduate study in mathematics.\nThe following application deadlines apply for both American and foreign students:\nThe following Master's-level programs are offered by the Department of Mathematics:\nMany students are interested in just a few courses, have considered the M.S. programs too late to apply, or were not accepted.  It is possible to apply as a non-degree, or non-matriculated student. Generally the non-degree option is used only by students who plan to study part-time and cannot be used by international students to obtain a student visa.\nInternational non-degree applicants cannot apply on line and must request an application from the Graduate School of Arts and Science (please visit the GSAS website). Recommendation letters and GRE scores are not required for admission on a non-degree basis. The academic background required for non-degree admission is the same as the requirement for the master’s degrees, as these students will be taking the same courses as master’s degree students. Non-degree students are allowed to take up to four courses. They are expected to meet the same academic standards as matriculated students.\nAfter completing four courses, students can apply for admission to the M.S. program in Mathematics, Math Finance or Scientific Computing. Students will need to formally apply through GSAS online. Students should note that due to limited resources, admission to an M.S. program is not automatic or guaranteed after completing four courses with good grades.\nAdmission decisions are based on a careful review of the applicant's previous academic record, letters of recommendation, TOEFL (if applicable) and GRE scores, as well as other credentials, such as work experience or previous research projects. Master's students can study either part-time or full-time. Note that international students must be full-time students.\nFor more information, please contact us at:\nadmissions@math.nyu.edu\nPhone: (212) 998-3238\nFax: (212) 995-4121\nAll applicants must have earned (or be about to complete) a B.A. or B.S. or the equivalent.  They must have taken three semesters of college-level calculus, including one semester of advanced calculus or linear algebra or the equivalent.  Students who do not have the advanced calculus course may be required to take the course MATH-GA 1002 Multivariable Analysis.\nAs previously emphasized, these are the very minimum requirements; additional undergraduate coursework in mathematics is desirable. Courses in analysis, linear algebra, complex variables, partial and ordinary differential equations, and probability theory are especially helpful.\nStudents who do not have some necessary mathematical preparation may be able to compensate by taking courses at Courant on a non-degree basis.\nThe NYU Office of Financial Aid carries forms and information regarding loans and grants, including the Federal Student Aid Fact Sheet.\nOffice of Financial Aid\nNew York University\n23 West 4th Street\nNew York, NY 10012\nPhone: (212) 998-4444\n• Home\n• About\n• People\n• Research\n• Courses\n• Graduate\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nPh.D. in Mathematics\n\n\nPh.D. in Atmosphere Ocean Science\n\n\nM.S. at Graduate School of Arts & Science\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nAdmissions\n\n\nM.S. in Mathematics\n\n\nM.S. in Scientific Computing\n\n\nM.S. in Mathematics in Finance\n\n\nNon-Degree Study\n\n\n\n\nM.S. at Tandon School of Engineering\n\n\nCurrent Students\n\n\nAwards\n• Overview\n• Ph.D. in Mathematics\n• Ph.D. in Atmosphere Ocean Science\n• M.S. at Graduate School of Arts & Science\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nAdmissions\n\n\nM.S. in Mathematics\n\n\nM.S. in Scientific Computing\n\n\nM.S. in Mathematics in Finance\n\n\nNon-Degree Study\n• Overview\n• Admissions\n• M.S. in Mathematics\n• M.S. in Scientific Computing\n• M.S. in Mathematics in Finance\n• Non-Degree Study\n• M.S. at Tandon School of Engineering\n• Current Students\n• Awards\n• Undergrad\n• Resources\n• Community\n• Calendars\n• Admin Import Form\n• Overview\n• Ph.D. in Mathematics\n• Ph.D. in Atmosphere Ocean Science\n• M.S. at Graduate School of Arts & Science\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nAdmissions\n\n\nM.S. in Mathematics\n\n\nM.S. in Scientific Computing\n\n\nM.S. in Mathematics in Finance\n\n\nNon-Degree Study\n• Overview\n• Admissions\n• M.S. in Mathematics\n• M.S. in Scientific Computing\n• M.S. in Mathematics in Finance\n• Non-Degree Study\n• M.S. at Tandon School of Engineering\n• Current Students\n• Awards\n• Overview\n• Admissions\n• M.S. in Mathematics\n• M.S. in Scientific Computing\n• M.S. in Mathematics in Finance\n• Non-Degree Study\n• All applicants must have an accredited baccalaureate degree or its equivalent.  Applicants in their last semester of undergraduate study must graduate before they begin their graduate work at NYU.\n• An official transcript from all previously attended institutions (undergraduate, graduate, and continuing educational programs) must be uploaded using the online application system.\n• A student must provide three letters of  recommendation (except non-degree).  It is strongly recommended that at least two of these letters be from faculty with whom the applicant took a mathematics or  other science course.

The GSAS web site also has instructions and links to the most frequently asked questions and verification about receipt of applications. \nThe rules and regulations governing admissions to NYU's Graduate School of Arts and Science must be met by all applicants seeking admission to graduate study in mathematics.\n\nAll applicants must have an accredited baccalaureate degree or its equivalent.  Applicants in their last semester of undergraduate study must graduate before they begin their graduate work at NYU.\nAn official transcript from all previously attended institutions (undergraduate, graduate, and continuing educational programs) must be uploaded using the online application system.\nA student must provide three letters of  recommendation (except non-degree).  It is strongly recommended that at least two of these letters be from faculty with whom the applicant took a mathematics or  other science course. Letters must be submitted using the online application system.\nApplicants are expected to submit their GRE Mathematics Subject Test score.  If taking this test is not practical for an applicant, they must attach a short statement to their application explaining why they were not able to take the GRE Mathematics Subject Test. GRE General Test Scores are neither required nor accepted as part of the application.\nApplicants whose native language is not English must submit a TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) score; scores of  less than 600 (250 for the computer-based test; 100 for the internet-based test) are generally not recommended for admission.  This requirement may be waived  for an applicant with an accredited degree from an institution where English was the language of instruction.

Generally the non-degree option is used only by students who plan to study part-time and cannot be used by international students to obtain a student visa.\nInternational non-degree applicants cannot apply on line and must request an application from the Graduate School of Arts and Science (please visit the GSAS website). Recommendation letters and GRE scores are not required for admission on a non-degree basis. The academic background required for non-degree admission is the same as the requirement for the master’s degrees, as these students will be taking the same courses as master’s degree students. Non-degree students are allowed to take up to four courses. They are expected to meet the same academic standards as matriculated students.\nAfter completing four courses, students can apply for admission to the M.S. program in Mathematics, Math Finance or Scientific Computing. Students will need to formally apply through GSAS online. Students should note that due to limited resources, admission to an M.S. program is not automatic or guaranteed after completing four courses with good grades.\n \nAdmission Criteria\nAdmission decisions are based on a careful review of the applicant's previous academic record, letters of recommendation, TOEFL (if applicable) and GRE scores, as well as other credentials, such as work experience or previous research projects. Master's students can study either part-time or full-time. Note that international students must be full-time students.\nFor more information, please contact us at:\nOffice of Admissions and Student Affairs\nDepartment of Mathematics\nCourant Institute of Mathematical Sciences\n251 Mercer Street\nNew York, NY 10012-1185\nadmissions@math.nyu.edu\nPhone: (212) 998-3238\nFax: (212) 995-4121\n \nUndergraduate Background\nAll applicants must have earned (or be about to complete) a B.A. or B.S. or the equivalent.  They must have taken three semesters of college-level calculus, including one semester of advanced calculus or linear algebra or the equivalent.  Students who do not have the advanced calculus course may be required to take the course MATH-GA 1002 Multivariable Analysis.\nAs previously emphasized, these are the very minimum requirements; additional undergraduate coursework in mathematics is desirable. Courses in analysis, linear algebra, complex variables, partial and ordinary differential equations, and probability theory are especially helpful.\nStudents who do not have some necessary mathematical preparation may be able to compensate by taking courses at Courant on a non-degree basis.\n \nFinancial Aid\nThe NYU Office of Financial Aid carries forms and information regarding loans and grants, including the Federal Student Aid Fact Sheet.\nOffice of Financial Aid\nNew York University\n23 West 4th Street\nNew York, NY 10012\nPhone: (212) 998-4444",
