You must complete 66 credit units, of which at least 42 must be in advanced subjects, to earn your degree.\nWhat’s more, you’ll put classroom theory into practice by writing a thesis based on independent research you’ve conducted under the guidance of your faculty advisor. Prior to graduation, you’ll present your research to your fellow ORC members.\nUpon completion of our two-year program, you’ll be ready to put your knowledge and skills to good use in a variety of fields, including business, education, and research. In fact, recent graduates of our program have been sought after for such positions as technical staff members in business or industry, government planners, and private consultants.\nFor more information about the Master’s program, please see our Master’s Degree Syllabus.\nStudents who are currently enrolled in another master’s degree (SM) program at MIT may consider pursuing a dual SM in OR. In order to pursue a dual masters degree in the OR program you would need to submit a complete application to the Center for consideration for admission. You would need to go through the standard SM admissions process and be admitted like any other student. Once accepted into the program, you must be currently enrolled in another SM program at MIT in order to pursue the dual SM. The dual SM program requires that you complete coursework for both programs. Courses must be distinct and you cannot double count courses. Therefore, you would need to fulfill all the requirements of an ORC SM student in addition to those of other MIT programs. This would mean taking at least seven approved MIT graduate courses for the ORC program in addition to an approved thesis. This thesis could be used toward both SM degrees, however we would require that an OR-affiliated Faculty member oversees the thesis to make sure it contains the proper OR content to qualify for an SM in OR. For more information, please contact the ORC at orc_staff​@mit.edu.\nFor more information about ORC course offerings, please see our Course Offerings page.\n• Apply SM\n[GRID_TABLE]\nWHAT IS OPERATIONS RESEARCH?\nOperations research (OR) is the discipline of applying advanced analytical methods—such as optimization, statistics, machine learning, and probability—to make better decisions that impact society and the world positively.\n\n\n\n\nApply SM\n\n\n\nCONTACT US\nPhone: 617-253-3601Email: orc_staff@mit.edu\nWHAT IS OPERATIONS RESEARCH?\nCONTACT US\nPhone: 617-253-3601Email: orc_staff@mit.edu\nMIT’s master’s degree (SM) program in operations research (OR) teaches you important OR techniques—with an emphasis on the practical, real-world applications of OR—through a combination of challenging coursework and hands-on research. \nIn addition to the writing competency requirements, our rigorous curriculum includes seven graduate-level courses in such areas as optimization, applied probability, and statistics as well as advanced topics in OR that complement your academic interests and career goals.
