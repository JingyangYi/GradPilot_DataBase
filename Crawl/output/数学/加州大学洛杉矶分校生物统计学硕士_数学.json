Students will be able to apply their statistical and computing skills to real-world health problems ranging from disease outbreaks, environmental and industrial hazards, to development of public health, pharmaceutical, and medical interventions, and much more. The MS program is designed for students seeking a broad-based foundation in applied statistical methodology, statistical inference, and statistical computing. It prepares students for research careers in academia, business, health-care organizations, and government.\nMathematics preparation for the program should include at least two years of calculus:\nThe program requires the completion of a minimum of 70 quarter-credit units. Unless previously taken, the following courses must be included in the degree program:\nAll required courses toward the degree must be taken on a letter-grade basis, with the exception of Biostatistics 402B.\nA written report under the direction of a member of the Department of Biostatistics faculty is required. In the spring of the second year of study, students take both Biostatistics 596 under the direction of a faculty member and Biostatistics 244 to guide the report preparation.\nA written comprehensive exam is generally taken at the beginning of the second year of study in September. The scope of the exam includes material covered in the following biostatistics courses: 200A, 200B, 200C, 202A, and 202B. Students must pass the exam to receive the MS degree. Students have a maximum of two opportunities to pass the exam.\nFailure to secure a passing grade in at most two attempts in the MS Comprehensive Exam will result in the department recommending the student to the Graduate Division for Academic Disqualification.\nThe MS degree is typically obtained after two years of full-time study (six academic quarters).\nStudents in the MS program should take Biostatistics 200A and Biostatistics 216 in their first quarter, Biostatistics 200B and Biostatistics 202A in their second quarter, and Biostatistics 200C as well as Biostatistics 202B in their third quarter. They may also take additional courses in each of those quarters.\nBiostatisticians have the potential to make enormous scientific impact in medicine, public health, life sciences, survey research, and computer science. There is tremendous variety in possible areas of application, including AIDS, cancer, genetics, imaging, bioinformatics, immunology, and public policy. Graduates of the program work in a variety of policy and management healthcare settings.\nExamples of positions include:\nView a list of faculty in the Department of Biostatistics.\nFor the most up to date fees and more information on fee breakdown, visit the registrar's office.\nPlease see the cost and aid section of our website for information on awards, scholarships, training opportunities, employment, summer internship funding, and need-based aid. Please note that opportunities listed under 'Summer Internship Funding' are only applicable to MPH students.\nIn addition to the University’s Minimum Requirements, most applicants for the MS in Biostatistics have a bachelor's degree in mathematics, or in a physical, biological or social science. Two years of calculus and one quarter of linear algebra is required for the degree — more is always helpful. Experience with some programming and statistics or biostatistics, as well as some experience with a statistics computer package is recommended.\nVisit the application guide to learn about our admissions process.\nThis information is intended as an overview, and should be used as a guide only. Requirements, course offerings and other elements may change, and this overview may not list all details of the program.\nAdmission requirements listed are departmental requirements, and are in addition to the University's minimum requirements. Many programs receive more applicants than can be admitted, so meeting the minimum requirements for admission does not ensure admission. Every effort is made to ensure minimum admissions requirements are up to date - for the most up-to-date information on the University's minimum requirements, please visit the UCLA Graduate Division.\nFees are subject to change and should be used as a guide only.

The school also administers informal certificate programs for UCLA Fielding and other UCLA students.\nReview and compare UCLA Fielding's degree programs to find the one that aligns with your public health goals.\nUCLA Fielding's BA in Public Health equips students to apply public health to general and global issues for which some scientific background is necessary to understand the importance of the health factors involved. Students interested in science-based approaches to public health can apply to UCLA Fielding’s BS in Public Health. The Minor in Public Health provides students in other majors an opportunity to learn more about core public health functions.\nThe Master of Public Health (MPH), UCLA Fielding’s professional degree, prepares graduates for careers in which they address public health issues in wide-ranging settings. Students receive broad training in public health, as well as specialized knowledge in a public health discipline as represented by the five FSPH departments. A required applied practice experience allows students to apply their classroom-obtained knowledge to real-world problems with a community partner. The MPH is a two-year program, although accelerated options are available for students with particular qualifications, such as a clinical doctoral degree.\nFor professionals seeking to advance their careers by earning an MPH while continuing to work full time, UCLA Fielding features two executive programs: The Master of Public Health for Health Professionals (MPH-HP), offered by the Department of Community Health Sciences; and the Executive Master of Public Health (EMPH), offered by the Department of Health Policy and Management. These two-year programs, with course meetings scheduled on weekends and during the summer months and taught by UCLA Fielding’s world-renowned faculty and public health practitioners, are tailored to students from diverse backgrounds looking to gain new skills, obtain leadership positions in their organizations, or change their professional focus.\nThrough any of nine dual degree programs, students can combine the MPH with a Doctor of Medicine (MD), Juris Doctor (JD), Master of Business Administration (MBA), Master of Social Work (MSW), Master of Public Policy (MPP), or Master of Urban and Regional Planning (MURP), or with Master of Arts (MA) programs in African, Asian American, or Latin American studies. These programs provide students with the opportunity to gain expertise in both public health and another discipline. Students can take advantage of overlapping and shared requirements to complete their degrees in a shorter period of time.\nThe online Master of Healthcare Administration (MHA) equips graduates with the knowledge and skills that are in highest demands for administrative roles in healthcare. MHA graduates work in positions that include clinical administration, C-suite executive, healthcare planning and management, and non-clinical roles.\nThe Master of Data Science in Health (MDSH), established in response to the growing demands of the health industry for well-trained professional health-data analytics leaders, emphasizes data analytical tools, computing, practical health data solutions, and close connections with the health industry and other fields in public health.\nPublic health professionals pursue a wide array of careers. An MPH in Biostatistics prepares graduates for positions as statisticians and researchers in fields such as genetic research, bioinformatics, and medicine, working in academia, industry, government organizations, or allied scientific disciplines. With an MPH in Community Health Sciences, graduates generally assume positions in the planning, administration, and evaluation of public health programs and policies, both in the U.S. and abroad. Graduates of the MPH in Environmental Health Sciences program pursue private- and public-sector careers as community educators, activists, managers, policymakers, and practitioners. With an MPH in Epidemiology, graduates work in settings that include international health agencies, state and local health departments, federal government agencies and health programs, health maintenance organizations, colleges and universities, and research institutions. An MPH in Health Policy or Health Management prepares graduates to work in a variety of policy and management healthcare settings in areas such as consulting, project management, financial analysis, research, and administration.\nTake the first (or next) step in your public health journey at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health.\nUCLA Fielding offers three research-oriented degrees, emphasizing theoretical issues and the application of disciplinary methods to the study of contemporary public health issues. Students choose an UCLA Fielding department in which to specialize, with the exception of the interdepartmental PhD in Environmental and Molecular Toxicology where students may choose a department from several UCLA colleges. The research-oriented degrees prepare students for careers involving research activities, whether those careers involve academic institutions, governmental organizations, industry and non-governmental research organizations institutes.\nThe Master of Science (MS) is an academic, research-oriented degree that many students pursue in preparation for the PhD. The MS involves intensive coursework in a focused area, along with a major research project.\nThe Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) is an advanced research degree emphasizing depth of knowledge and research skills. The PhD involves specialized coursework and a major original research effort.\nThe interdepartmental PhD in Environmental and Molecular Toxicology provides an integrated curriculum in several disciplines, taught by faculty from UCLA Fielding as well as from multiple departments in the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine and UCLA College of Letters and Science. The program prepares graduates for positions as toxicology researchers and faculty members.\nInformal certificate programs — open to UCLA Fielding as well as other UCLA graduate students — provide knowledge and skills in a particular area of public health. FSPH certificate programs include the Global Health Certificate, Bixby Population and Reproductive Health Certificate, Registered Environmental.\nDr. David Eisenman, professor in the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health’s Department of Community Health Sciences, was interviewed by NPR on how medications can affect the way people's bodies react to, or perceive, heat.\nDr. Naomi Zewde, assistant professor in the UCLA Fielding School Department of Health Policy and Management, was interviewed by NPR about her research into the impact of so-called \"baby bonds.\"\n[CARD]\nFind & Compare Degrees\n\nReview and compare UCLA Fielding's degree programs to find the one that aligns with your public health goals.\n\nCompare\n[CARD]\nCompare\n[CARD]\nCompare\n[CARD]\nApply to UCLA Fielding\n\nTake the first (or next) step in your public health journey at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health.\n\nApply\n[CARD]\nApply\n[CARD]\nApply\n[CARD]\nNPR | \"Why certain medications can increase your risk in the heat\"\nJuly 30, 2025\n\nNPR | \"Why certain medications can increase your risk in the heat\"\nDr. David Eisenman, professor in the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health’s Department of Community Health Sciences, was interviewed by NPR on how medications can affect the way people's bodies react to, or perceive, heat.\n\nRead Full Article\n[CARD]\nNPR | \"Why certain medications can increase your risk in the heat\"\nRead Full Article\n[CARD]\nJuly 30, 2025\n[CARD]\nNPR | \"Why certain medications can increase your risk in the heat\"\n[CARD]\nDr. David Eisenman, professor in the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health’s Department of Community Health Sciences, was interviewed by NPR on how medications can affect the way people's bodies react to, or perceive, heat.\n[CARD]\nNPR | \"A baby bonds bonanza\"\nJuly 28, 2025\n\nNPR | \"A baby bonds bonanza\"\nDr. Naomi Zewde, assistant professor in the UCLA Fielding School Department of Health Policy and Management, was interviewed by NPR about her research into the impact of so-called \"baby bonds.\"\n\nRead Full Article\n[CARD]\nNPR | \"A baby bonds bonanza\"\nRead Full Article\n[CARD]\nJuly 28, 2025\n[CARD]\nNPR | \"A baby bonds bonanza\"\n[CARD]\nDr. Naomi Zewde, assistant professor in the UCLA Fielding School Department of Health Policy and Management, was interviewed by NPR about her research into the impact of so-called \"baby bonds.\"",

Applied Practice Experience (APEx)\n[HEADING] Desired Qualifications\n[HEADING] Admissions Process\n[HEADING] Please Note:\n[HEADING] Related Programs\nThe UCLA Fielding School of Public Health and the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA's articulated degree program is designed to enable students to complete both the MPH and the MD degree programs in five years. The program includes four years of medical school, and one year and one additional quarter at UCLA Fielding. UCLA medical students apply to the MPH program in the Fall quarter of their junior (third) year. Students interested in this articulated program should contact the Student Affairs Office at the School of Medicine and the Office of Student Services at UCLA Fielding.\nAn MPH in Biostatistics is a natural direction for individuals with quantitative skills that offers exceptional opportunities to contribute to transforming public health. Graduates apply valuable statistical and computing skills to real-world problems ranging from disease outbreaks, environmental and industrial hazards, to development of social, psychological and medical interventions. This professional degree program includes coursework on biostatistical methods, statistical programming, data management all applied to public health, and courses spanning the multiple disciplines of public health. Students complete an internship in a practice setting.\nMathematics preparation for the program should include at least one year of calculus:\nThe program requires the completion of 62 quarter-credit units.\nMPH students are required to take three core biostatistics methods courses in year one.  Typically MPH students in Biostatistics meet this requirement by completing one of the three series below:\nThe difference between the biostatistics methods sequences (200A, 100B, 406 vs. 200A, 200B, 200C) is that the 200 sequence has more technical and mathematical detail while the 100B/406 sequence focuses on more practical applications. The 200 sequence is taken by MS students in the Department of Biostatistics while the 100B/406 sequence is often taken by MPH students in other departments in the School of Public Health.

Graduates apply valuable statistical and computing skills to real-world problems ranging from disease outbreaks, environmental and industrial hazards, to development of social, psychological and medical interventions. This professional degree program includes coursework on biostatistical methods, statistical programming, data management all applied to public health, and courses spanning the multiple disciplines of public health. Students complete an internship in a practice setting.\nMathematics preparation for the program should include at least one year of calculus:\nThe program requires the completion of 62 quarter-credit units.\nMPH students are required to take three core biostatistics methods courses in year one. Typically MPH students in Biostatistics meet this requirement by completing one of the three series below:\nThe difference between the biostatistics methods sequences (200A, 201B, 406 vs. 200A, 200B, 200C) is that the 200 sequence has more technical and mathematical detail while the 201B/406 sequence focuses on more practical applications. The 200 sequence is taken by MS students in the Department of Biostatistics while the 201B/406 sequence is often taken by MPH students in other departments in the School of Public Health. The decision of whether the Biostatistics 200 sequence is an appropriate fit should be made in consultation with the student's academic advisor, career goals and prior mathematical background. In order to register for the Biostatistics 200 sequence students will need a PTE (permission to enroll) number. To obtain a PTE number students should contact Roxy Naranjo (rlnaranjo@ph.ucla.edu) and the 200-course instructor.\nIn addition to the 3 methods courses above, students are required to take:\nRequired courses for the degree must be taken for a letter grade.\nM.P.H. students in Biostatistics are required to complete an approved public health internship, referred to as an Applied Practice Experience (APEx) or field studies, of at least 400 hours to provide practical experience applying biostatistics. APEx is usually performed during the summer between the first and second year of the program. However, requirements for satisfying APEx begin in the winter quarter of the first year of the program.

Typically MPH students in Biostatistics meet this requirement by completing one of the three series below:\n\nBIOS 200A, 201B and 406\nBIOS 200A, 200B and 200C\nBIOS 200A, 200B and 406.\n\nThe difference between the biostatistics methods sequences (200A, 201B, 406 vs. 200A, 200B, 200C) is that the 200 sequence has more technical and mathematical detail while the 201B/406 sequence focuses on more practical applications. The 200 sequence is taken by MS students in the Department of Biostatistics while the 201B/406 sequence is often taken by MPH students in other departments in the School of Public Health. The decision of whether the Biostatistics 200 sequence is an appropriate fit should be made in consultation with the student's academic advisor, career goals and prior mathematical background. In order to register for the Biostatistics 200 sequence students will need a PTE (permission to enroll) number. To obtain a PTE number students should contact Roxy Naranjo (rlnaranjo@ph.ucla.edu) and the 200-course instructor.\nIn addition to the 3 methods courses above, students are required to take:\n\nBIOS 211A: Topics in Applied Regression\nBIOS 211B: Topics in Applied Regression\nBIOS 203A: Introduction to Data Management and Statistical Computing\nBIOS 400: APEx in Biostatistics (4 units)\nBIOS 402A: Principles of Biostatistical Consulting (2 units)\nBIOS 595: Effective Integration of Biostatistical Concepts in Public Health Research\nAnd 12 units of biostatistics elective courses chosen from courses in the 200 series with course numbers from 203B, M208, 213 and above or from the 400 series\nNote: carefully check course prerequisites to ensure eligibility for the courses and consult with academic advisor.\n\nRequired courses for the degree must be taken for a letter grade. \nCore Course Requirements in Public Health\n\nPH 200A and B: Foundations in Public Health\nPH 401: Public Health as a Profession\n\nApplied Practice Experience (APEx)\nM.P.H. students in Biostatistics are required to complete an approved public health internship, referred to as an Applied Practice Experience (APEx) or field studies, of at least 400 hours to provide practical experience applying biostatistics. APEx is usually performed during the summer between the first and second year of the program. However, requirements for satisfying APEx begin in the winter quarter of the first year of the program. Students should consult the Biostatistics 400 handbook for details.\nStudents should begin identifying a suitable applied practice experience in the middle of their first year.

Rigorous courses are taught by world leaders in their specialties and train students in mathematical statistics, advanced biostatistical methods, big data, machine learning, data science, and statistical computing. The PhD trains statisticians who can develop and apply appropriate statistical methods to solve novel problems in the health field and who can conduct statistical methodological research.\nMathematics preparation for the program should include at least two years of calculus, as well as some linear algebra:\nMore math is always better, particularly for the PhD program, where real analysis (UCLA Math 131A, 131B), and linear algebra (UCLA Math 115A, 115B) are desirable.\nThe program requires the completion of the following elements:\nUnless previously taken, students are required to take the following courses:\nStudents must pass a written examination called the PhD preliminary exam. Failure to secure a passing grade in a maximum of two attempts will result in the department recommending the student to the graduate division for academic disqualification.\nThis exam is offered in September just before fall classes begin. Students typically take this exam at the beginning of their second year of study after completing the related coursework and are expected to pass at a level that predicts successful completion of the PhD program. The exam covers material in the following courses: Biostatistics 200 A, B, and C, and Biostatistics 202 A and B.\nThe oral qualifying exam evaluates a student’s understanding of statistical theory and ability to apply the theory, and reviews the proposed dissertation topic. The student should prepare a written dissertation proposal that includes background, preliminary work, and a research plan for completing the work. While there are no absolute page requirements, proposals are generally between 15 to 50 pages, with additional pages for figures and references. The proposal should be distributed to members of the dissertation committee in advance of the exam. The proposal is expected to be delivered to committee members at least two weeks before the scheduled oral exam. If the student expects the proposal to be delivered less than two weeks before the exam, the student should obtain advance approval from each committee member. During the oral exam, the student will present and defend the proposed work. The student can expect the majority of the questions to pertain to the proposal, however additional questions may be asked to assess general understanding of biostatistical principles. The overall objective of the exam is to evaluate whether the student has the ability and adequate plans for conducting PhD dissertation research.\nThe PhD dissertation is original research that advances the field of biostatistics. The dissertation is completed under the guidance of a Department of Biostatistics faculty member who serves as the adviser. Examples of dissertations from previous graduates are available in the Biostatistics Library. After successfully completing a dissertation, an oral examination defending the dissertation is conducted by the dissertation committee. A failed examination may be repeated once on the recommendation of the committee.\nThe PhD in biostatistics is typically a four-year program following the MS, although some students may complete the program in less time.\nThe sequence of classes taken during the first year of study depends on the student’s background. Doctoral students establish a sequence of courses in consultation with their academic adviser to best prepare them for the comprehensive exams.\nGraduates from UCLA Fielding's Department of Biostatistics obtain employment as faculty members at universities and as leaders in government research organizations, and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies locally within California, throughout the United States and across the globe.\nExamples of positions held by graduates include:\nView a list of faculty in the Department of Biostatistics.\nFor the most up to date fees and more information on fee breakdown, visit the registrar's office.\nPlease see the cost and aid section of our website for information on awards, scholarships, training opportunities, employment, summer internship funding, and need-based aid. Please note that opportunities listed under 'Summer Internship Funding' are only applicable to MPH students.\nIn addition to the University’s minimum requirements, competitive applicants are expected to possess strong quantitative skills that can be demonstrated through their coursework and GRE quantitative score. Ideally, successful candidates should have completed at least 30 quarter credits in mathematics and statistics, including multivariate calculus, linear algebra, and calculus-based probability theory.\nVisit the application guide to learn about our admissions process.\nThis information is intended as an overview, and should be used as a guide only. Requirements, course offerings and other elements may change, and this overview may not list all details of the program.\nAdmission requirements listed are departmental requirements, and are in addition to the University's minimum requirements. Many programs receive more applicants than can be admitted, so meeting the minimum requirements for admission does not ensure admission. Every effort is made to ensure minimum admissions requirements are up to date - for the most up-to-date information on the University's minimum requirements, please visit the UCLA Graduate Division.\nFees are subject to change and should be used as a guide only.

The PhD trains statisticians who can develop and apply appropriate statistical methods to solve novel problems in the health field and who can conduct statistical methodological research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n            Degree Preparation\n      \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMathematics preparation for the program should include at least two years of calculus, as well as some linear algebra:\n\nMathematics 31A, B - Calculus and Analytic Geometry\nMathematics 32A, B - Calculus of Several Variables\nMathematics 33A, B - Matrices, Differential Equations, Infinite Series\nMathematics 115A - Linear Algebra\n\nMore math is always better, particularly for the PhD program, where real analysis (UCLA Math 131A, 131B), and linear algebra (UCLA Math 115A, 115B) are desirable.\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n            Program Requirements\n      \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe program requires the completion of the following elements:\nCourse Requirements\nUnless previously taken, students are required to take the following courses:\n\nBiostatistics 200 A, B, C: Method in Biostatistics\nBiostatistics 202 A, B: Mathematical Statistics\nBiostatistics 216: Mathematical Methods for Biostatistics\nBiostatistics 250 A, B: Linear Models\nBiostatistics 250 C: Multivariate Biostatistics\nBiostatistics 257: Computational Methods for Biostatistical Research\nBiostatistics 245 & 246: Doctoral Seminar\nBiostatistics 409: Biostatistics Consulting\nMathematics 131 A: Real Analysis (must be taken in year 1 by students with limited or no prior experience to Real Analysis)\nOne 4-unit course in the Department of Epidemiology (either EPI 100 or 200A)\nOne 4-unit course in board public health (PH 150/C201 or HPM M242)\nMinimum of 6 4-unit Biostatistics special topics courses from Biostatistics 202C, 210 and above.\n\nPh.D. Preliminary Written Examination\nStudents must pass a written examination called the PhD preliminary exam. Failure to secure a passing grade in a maximum of two attempts will result in the department recommending the student to the graduate division for academic disqualification.\nThis exam is offered in September just before fall classes begin. Students typically take this exam at the beginning of their second year of study after completing the related coursework and are expected to pass at a level that predicts successful completion of the PhD program. The exam covers material in the following courses: Biostatistics 200 A, B, and C, and Biostatistics 202 A and B.\n\nStudents must pass the exam at a level expected of doctoral students\nStudents have a maximum of two attempts to pass the exam\nStudents with a prior master’s degree in Biostatistics from UCLA are exempt from taking the Ph.D. Preliminary Examination, as it was taken during their MS study.\n\nOral Qualifying Exam\nThe oral qualifying exam evaluates a student’s understanding of statistical theory and ability to apply the theory, and reviews the proposed dissertation topic. The student should prepare a written dissertation proposal that includes background, preliminary work, and a research plan for completing the work. While there are no absolute page requirements, proposals are generally between 15 to 50 pages, with additional pages for figures and references. The proposal should be distributed to members of the dissertation committee in advance of the exam. The proposal is expected to be delivered to committee members at least two weeks before the scheduled oral exam. If the student expects the proposal to be delivered less than two weeks before the exam, the student should obtain advance approval from each committee member. During the oral exam, the student will present and defend the proposed work. The student can expect the majority of the questions to pertain to the proposal, however additional questions may be asked to assess general understanding of biostatistical principles. The overall objective of the exam is to evaluate whether the student has the ability and adequate plans for conducting PhD dissertation research.\nPhD Dissertation and Oral Defense\nThe PhD dissertation is original research that advances the field of biostatistics. The dissertation is completed under the guidance of a Department of Biostatistics faculty member who serves as the adviser. Examples of dissertations from previous graduates are available in the Biostatistics Library. After successfully completing a dissertation, an oral examination defending the dissertation is conducted by the dissertation committee. A failed examination may be repeated once on the recommendation of the committee.\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n            Time to Degree\n      \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe PhD in biostatistics is typically a four-year program following the MS, although some students may complete the program in less time.\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n            Course Sequencing\n      \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sequence of classes taken during the first year of study depends on the student’s background.

The applicant uploads transcripts, supplemental information, department-specific material (such as a portfolio), statement of purpose, and letters of recommendation. The applicant’s information then becomes available online to the graduate program.\nThis varies by program. Grades, letters of recommendation, writing samples, portfolios of work, auditions, standardized test scores, etc., are some, but not all, of the factors considered by the faculty.  An applicant’s research interests, and the availability of faculty to support those interests, are examples of additional factors in the review process.\nProspective applicants to UCLA are encouraged to view our Program Statistics which provides admissions data by academic program. Data includes applicants, admits, and new registered student counts. In addition it provides demographic data on the enrolled student body, the number degrees awarded, and the average time to receive a degree.\nNo. University regulations permit an applicant to apply to one major only, with the exception of established concurrent or articulated degrees.\nPlease decide which of our programs is most appropriate for you prior to submitting the Application for Graduate Admission.\nNo. Students must be admitted to UCLA in a degree program in order to enroll in regular university classes.\nYou may take courses offered by UCLA Extension without formal admittance to UCLA.

Then type in the name of the institution.\nMany applicants still have work in progress at the time of the deadline.  Upload your most recent transcript, which may not have any of your senior year coursework on it.\nYes, this may be helpful to the application review, especially if you took prerequisites for your graduate program there.\nUCLA receives most official test scores (GRE, TOEFL) electronically from ETS, and IELTS scores directly from IELTS. Further information about the GRE and TOEFL, including UCLA’s school code (4837) and department codes (to route your hardcopy scores to your proposed major program), is available on the ETS website.\nIn order for your official scores to be matched to your application, be sure that the personal information you give on the Application for Graduate Admission is exactly the same as the information you gave at the time you took the test. Any variations between your name, date of birth, and gender on the application vs your test score report will result in your scores failing to match to your application.\nYou may submit your application if you have not yet taken the GRE (if required by your program) or TOEFL or IELTS tests and plan to take the test in the future. Enter the planned future date of the test(s) and leave the score section blank.  Be sure to contact your proposed major if your scores won’t arrive by the application deadline.\nIf you have taken the GRE, TOEFL or IELTS more than once, and the testing agency transmits your scores to UCLA, all of the scores will appear as part of your application.

You can send reminders to your recommenders via the application.\nPlease ask your recommender to contact onlineapphelp@grad.ucla.edu. Your recommender should include a detailed description of the issue and screenshots if possible.\nMany email service providers have upgraded their spam blocking tools to allow their customers greater control over received messages.\nTo ensure that important system messages are received by the recommendation providers, please have them add the following email address to their address book and/or your list of approved email addresses:  admissions@grad.ucla.edu.\nAfter your recommender has added that email address, you can resend the recommendation notification from your application.\nIf your recommender still does not receive the invitation, there may be a firewall at the institution that prevents receipt. This is especially true of institutions in China. In that case, please request another email address for the recommender and add that to the recommender section.\nLog back into the application and go to the Letter of Recommendations section.  There you’ll be able to see whether your recommenders have submitted their letters.\nApplicants are not permitted to inspect letters of recommendation in their UCLA files, per University policy.\nOnly if a) you are admitted and enroll at UCLA, and b) you did not waive your right to view them, would you be able to request to see your letters of recommendation.\nFor any inquiries about the progress of your submitted application (whether official transcripts or other supporting materials that you did not upload into the application have been received, etc.) you should contact the program to which you are applying.\nTest scores may be delayed in matching up. If the personal information given on the application is different from the information you provided ETS, the scores may not match.\nAfter you submit your application, an email acknowledgment will be sent to you within 72 hours. This email includes your nine-digit UCLA ID number.  We send it from gradapp@mvs.ais.ucla.edu. Be sure to clear this address in your address book/filter to avoid its being redirected as spam.\nPlease don’t worry! This email refers to minor data issues related to personal information you submitted and do not affect review of your application.  There may be an applicant or student already in the database who has the same name and a very similar birthdate. Perhaps you applied before  under a different name.  We want to be sure your data is correct and loaded correctly, and we may need your help to determine if a correction is needed.\nSome UCLA programs have absolutely firm deadlines and never review a late application.\nOthers may be more flexible depending on circumstances.\nBefore you submit a late application, please contact the program directly to learn whether it can be considered. It is especially important to ask before submitting a late application because the application fee is not refundable.\nApplication materials are reviewed by faculty admissions committees in each major program who select the best qualified applicants. These admissions committees base their recommendations for admission upon a careful comparison of applications, and this may take considerable time.\nThere is no guarantee that any applicant will receive a response, favorable or unfavorable, on or before any specific date. Applicants, moreover, should not construe a lack of response as an intention to act favorably on the application.\nYou may contact your proposed major program directly if you are concerned that something may be missing from your portfolio that is delaying the decision process.\nThe CGS Resolution date of April 15th refers to offers of admission with funding. An applicant may not be pressured by a signatory institution to accept an offer before this date.  The Resolution does not require institutions to make all decisions before this date, and some programs may continue to make decisions in the late spring and summer.\nOnce a decision has been made, an email will be sent from the Division of Graduate Education to the email address you provided in the application. The email does not contain the decision; instead, you will be advised how to access your decision letter.\nPlease note that the decision cannot be given over the telephone or by email.\nTo view your decision status on-line, please log back into the application.\nTeaching assistantships and research appointments are part of merit-based funding awarded by the program. Applicants do not apply directly for this funding.\nIf you have questions or problems that are not answered here, please email us at: onlineAppHelp@grad.ucla.edu and we will do our best to assist you.\n• School of Dentistry\n• School of Law\n• School of Medicine\n[CARD]\nX\n[CARD]\nX",

Specific requirements (individual majors may have 500, 1,000 or 1,500 word limits; this information is in the application and on the each program’s website) and prompts are listed in the application and include\nThe Personal Statement is an opportunity for you to provide additional information that may aid the selection committee in evaluating your preparation and aptitude for graduate study at UCLA, including your contribution to diversity. The statement will also be used to consider candidates for the Cota-Robles & GOFP awards, which provide financial support to graduate students who make significant contributions to diversity. In the word’s of the University of California Diversity Statement, “Diversity” – a defining feature of California’s past, present and future – refers to the variety of personal experiences, values, and worldviews that arise from differences of culture and circumstance. Such differences include race, ethnicity, gender, age, religion, language, abilities/disabilities, sexual orientation, gender identity, socioeconomic status, geographic region, and more.” The complete text of this statement can be found online.\nInstructions to respond to one of more of the following prompts, including at least one prompt speaking to your contributions to diversity, are provided in the application and include a 500 words limit (approximately 1-page, single spaced, using 1-inch margins and 12-point font):\nThe faculty of each graduate program evaluate applicants who meet the minimum requirements and recommend a selection from among them. The number of qualified applicants to graduate programs at UCLA far exceeds the number of students who can be admitted.\nThe general requirement for admission for a U.S. student is a bachelor’s degree from a regionally accredited institution, comparable in standard and content to a bachelor’s degree from the University of California. Graduate admission through the regular process requires an overall scholastic average, including any post-baccalaureate study, of B (3.0 on a 4.0 scale) or better, or its equivalent if the letter grade system is not used. However, through the “Dean’s Special Action” (DSA) process, departments are able to admit applicants who do not meet this GPA requirement when other aspects of the applicant’s file suggest readiness for graduate study. The DSA process requires no additional action on the applicant’s part; it is at the department’s discretion to initiate it. Prospective applicants are encouraged, however, to see section 500.4.B on page 6 of UCLA’s Guidelines for the Graduate Admissions Process & Codification of Policies Governing Admission for more information about the DSA process.\nDegrees which are not considered comparable include those granted on the basis of work completed at institutions which are not fully accredited and those granted on the basis of nonacademic prior learning, test scores, or other than organized supervised coursework in academic subjects.\nAn international student whose post-secondary education is completed outside of the U.S. is expected to hold a degree representing completion of at least four years of study with above average/very good scholarship from a university or university-level institution.\nApplicants, including U.S. citizens and Permanent Residents, who do not hold a bachelor’s or higher degree from a university located in the United States or in another country in which English is both the spoken language of daily life and the medium of instruction, or who have not completed at least two years of full-time study at such an institution, please consult English Requirements.\nPlease review:\nSubmitted application materials are reviewed by faculty admissions committees in each major program who select the best qualified applicants. These admissions committees base recommendations for admission upon a careful comparison of applications, and this may take considerable time. Diversity, Inclusion and Admissions, therefore, cannot guarantee that the applicant will receive a response, favorable or unfavorable, on or before any specific date. The applicant, moreover, should not construe a lack of response as an intention to act favorably on the application.\nIf you receive an email about a discrepancy, please don’t worry. If you applied to UCLA before (or were an employee or a student), there may be a mismatch between your name or other personal data on the application and what is already in UCLA’s database. Many of these discrepancies (such as a name change) are resolved by the Division of Graduate Education staff without further need for communication, and the situation does not impede review of your application by the program. If you receive the discrepancy email a second time, please respond using the contact information in the email.\nWhen a decision is made, applicants receive an email, directing them to the Division of Graduate Education’s application site and the option Decision Status. Applicants sign in using the email address used to create their application account (not the User Name) and their application password to read the official decision letter.\nIf admitted, the conditions of admission and information and instructions concerning registration (via a link to the Statement of Intent to Register and a Statement of Legal Residence) will be included as part of the offer of admission letter, which can be printed out from the Division of Graduate Education site. (International applicants: please read Visa Procedures/Financial Verification.)\nOnly official notification from the dean of the Division of Graduate Education constitutes approval of admission.\nAlthough sometimes casually referred to as such, April 15th is not a deadline for graduate decision notification. Rather it is the date in the Council of Graduate Schools (CGS) Resolution before which no signatory institution may pressure an admitted applicant to accept an offer of admission with funding.\nCGS implemented this date to insure that admitted applicants have the opportunity to consider multiple offers of funding, instead of feeling the need to grab the first offer presented.  This is not a deadline by which institutions must reply to all applicants; CGS specifies that “Programs and/or institutions are free to make offers of admission and of financial support after April 15 if they choose to do so.”\nIf you wish to read more about the Council of Graduate Schools resolution re: April 15th.\nAs indicated above, and because of the decentralized nature of the graduate admissions process (applications are reviewed by individual faculty committees in the more than 100 academic and professional graduate majors offered), UCLA cannot guarantee a response to your application by a certain date.\nBoth the concurrent and articulated degree programs have the potential of allowing the student to acquire two degrees in less time than normally required if the courses of instruction are taken in sequence.\nView a list of concurrent and articulated degree programs at UCLA.\n• They are enrolled in a college or university and submit proof of receiving need-based financial aid,\n• or they meet income limits and submit their U.S. income tax form (with Social Security number redacted).\n• Submit a statement from your Financial Aid officer confirming all of the above and stating that payment of UCLA’s $135.00 application fee would be a financial hardship.\n• Submit a copy of your 2023 U.S. Federal Income Tax return.

University housing consists of off-campus apartments for married, single parent and single graduate students.\n• Student Parking Information\nStudent parking assignments are made on a need-based point system that considers such factors as class standing and commute distance, and favors those students who demonstrate the greatest need. If you wish to obtain an individual parking permit, you must submit a Student Parking Request form prior to the quarterly deadlines.\n• Summer Session\nThe UCLA Summer Sessions offer approximately 500 undergraduate and graduate courses each summer. Up-to-date information on course offerings, policies, and fees is available on the Summer Sessions and Special Programs website by mid-January each year.\n• Disabled Student Services\nThe University of California, Los Angeles actively encourages persons with disabilities to apply for admission. Federal Law (Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973) prohibits the University from requesting disability related information prior to admission. However, at any time, applicants are welcome to contact the Center for Accessible Education to obtain information regarding access, programs and available services.\n• Program Requirements\nOfficial listing of degree requirements by program.\n• General Catalog\nUCLA online catalog.\n[HTML_TABLE]\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5 | $23,828\n$32,227\n$40,626\n$49,025\n$57,424\n[CARD]\nX\n[CARD]\nX",
