In addition to the application requirements, international applicants may have to submit additional documentation.\nMost international applicants must submit scores of an English language proficiency test. Unless an applicant meets one of the exemption criteria listed below, official English language proficiency test scores less than 2 years old will be required as part of the application. To fulfill this requirement, the Bloomberg School will accept scores from the following tests. Please contact Admissions Services if you have questions about acceptable test scores. Applicants submitting scores should add name of test and test date to their Application System in order to be properly matched.\nInternational students applying for J-1 status must meet Department of State requirements for documenting English Proficiency.  Please consult the Office of International Services for guidance.\nInternet Based Test (iBT) (Includes TOEFL iBT Home Edition)*\nThe ETS institution code for SOPHAS applicants is 5688. The ETS institution code for DICAS and HAMPCAS applicants is 5352. SOPHAS Express applicants should use code 5352. Applicants who have tested multiple times should submit all test results.\n*We do not accept the TOEFL Essentials or TOEFL ITP.\nMinimum Scores iBT: 100\n(Includes IELTS Online; IELTS General Test is not accepted) We accept the IELTS One Skill Retake.\nAll SOPHAS applicants submit IELTS scores directly to SOPHAS. SOPHAS Express applicants should submit IELTS scores directly to SOPHAS .\nAll DICAS and HAMPCAS applicants submit IELTS scores should select Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health as a recipient.\nMinimum Score: 7\nAll applicants submit Duolingo English Test Scores directly to the Bloomberg School.

Your application will not be reviewed until all materials are received and may be withdrawn if incomplete after the application deadline.\nInternational Applicants are NOT REQUIRED to submit English language proficiency test scores if they meet at least one of the following exemption criteria:\nCitizen Status\nEarned or In-Progress Degrees in the U.S.\nEarned or In-Progress Degrees in countries where English is the Official Language\nEarned or In-Progress Degrees in countries where English is NOT the Official Language\nWe do NOT accept medium of instruction letters indicating the language of instruction is/was English in lieu of the above exceptions.\nWe accept credential evaluations from World Education Services, Inc (WES)* or ECE. We only accept U.S. based evaluations and cannot accept Canadian-based evaluations. The following steps lay out the credential evaluation process.\nStep 1: Gather a list of all schools you’ve attended or are currently attending outside the U.S.  All schools (except Study Abroad) must be included in your course-by-course evaluation.\nStep 2: Create an account with World Education Services, Inc (WES) or ECE.\nStep 3 : Contact your institution and have all documents required by WES or ECE sent directly from the school. Copies of documents sent from the applicant are not official and will not be accepted.\nStep 4: Order the WES ICAP Course-by-Course Credential Evaluation or ECE Course by Course Evaluation. Only course by-course evaluations will be accepted. BSPH does not accept general or Document-by-Document evaluations. Make sure to add the correct recipient to receive your report.\nStep 5: Monitor the evaluation process. Sometimes agencies will contact the applicant with additional steps or questions. To speed up the process it is important that applicants stay in communication with the credentialing agency.\nStep 6: Once your credential evaluation is completed, log into your applicant portal to ensure that it’s received. Please allow BSPH Admissions 2-3 business days to process newly received evaluations.\nIf you attended university outside of the United States or English-speaking Canada, your application will not be complete without an official credential evaluation.\n* Credential Evaluations are required for all post-secondary academic records from institutions outside the U.S. and English Speaking Canada. The credential evaluation must include your coursework from all college-level institutions you  have attended or are currently attending. The Bloomberg School accepts WES ICAP (course-by-course) through the Application System or ECE (course-by-course) sent directly to the Bloomberg School. Instructions are listed on our website.\nThe time it takes to complete a credential evaluation can often be lengthy. We typically recommend you start this process 4-6 months before your application deadline. Please remember to take into account:\nAfter the credential evaluation agency receives, reviews, and approves the documents from all issuing academic institutions, it will usually take about 7-10  business days to complete the evaluation.\nOther Important Tips:\nSpecial note for applicants with three-year undergraduate degrees from non-U.S. colleges and universities: The Bloomberg School only accepts the equivalent of a four year bachelor’s degree. In some situations, three-year degrees can be considered equivalent to a four-year U.S. bachelor's degree. Applicants can preview how their degree will be evaluated by using a free tool at the World Education Services website.\nBSPH does not accept ECFMG certification in place of a course-by-course credential evaluation from an approved agency.\nIf your degree was completed at the time you submitted the evaluation and it was done with official documents, you do not need to send an evaluation again. If your degree was in progress or completed with unofficial documents you will need to send an updated/completed evaluation showing the degree was completed and with official documents.\nYes. Applicants who are currently pursuing a degree from a school outside of the U.S. and will not graduate by the application deadline are required to submit a course-by-course evaluation of completed course work. Students who enroll are required to submit an updated transcript and degree certification directly from the school or university showing the degree was completed.\nNo, all international coursework must be evaluated with a course-by-course evaluation. Credential evaluations are used to assess a student's coursework against the U.S. grading system and is required as a part of the application.\nYes, applicants who have studied at a non-U.S. institution (except Study Abroad) will need to undergo a credential evaluation.\nAll admitted international degree students who plan to attend the Bloomberg School are required to attend in F-1 or J-1 status (unless you are already in possession of an immigration status in which studying is permissible). This process will not begin until you are formally admitted.\nThe Office of International Services will contact admitted international degree students who have completed their enrollment form in the spring. Additional instructions will be provided then.\nCertificate programs, part-time, and online programs  do NOT qualify for visa sponsorship. Most international students are advised to consider programs that can be completed online from their country of residence. Legal Permanent Residents and non-immigrants who are otherwise physically present in the US and in a status that allows for study may be eligible to pursue a certificate program in person at the Bloomberg School.\n• Academic Records and Transcripts\n• Connect with Current Students\n\n\nVirtual Student Experience\n• Virtual Student Experience\n• Information Sessions and Open House\n\n\nEvents

The Bloomberg School accepts WES ICAP (course-by-course) through the Application System or ECE (course-by-course) sent directly to the Bloomberg School. Instructions are listed on our website. Applicants  will be required to submit your WES evaluation directly through the Application System ( SOPHAS, DICAS, or HAMPCAS).\n**SOPHAS Express applicants should send official academic records and test scores directly to BSPH Admissions Services.  For English test scores please use the correct test code; for applicants using Parchment select “Johns Hopkins University Graduate Admissions”; for National Student Clearinghouse use bsph.admissions@jhu.edu.\nApplicants who are submitting Duolingo, PTE Academic, GMAT, and LSAT scores should send scores directly to BSPH Admissions Services. Please review full instructions for English proficiency tests and standardized test scores.\nIn general, degree applicants will need to submit the following:\nApplicants to Doctoral, Master's, and Residencies apply through SOPHAS. Please note the following exceptions:-MHA applicants apply through HAMPCAS or through SOPHAS-MSPH in Human Nutrition Dietitian applicants must apply through DICAS\nAll Certificate and Bachelor's/Master's (JHU undergraduates only) applicants apply through SOPHAS Express.\nThe Bloomberg School requires official academic records, transcripts, or mark sheets from ALL colleges, universities, graduate, or professional schools attended. Even if grades and credits from one institution appear on your home institution’s transcript, we require the transcript from the school where the credits originated. This includes post-graduate certificates and any educational history listed in the CV.\nDo not send transcripts to your Application System (HAMPCAS, SOPHAS or DICAS) until you list the institution sending the transcript in the “Colleges Attended” section. You must include your CAS ID# on the Transcript. Instructions: Sending Official Transcripts to SOPHASInstructions: Sending Official Transcripts to DICAS (MSPH in Human Nutrition-Dietitian applicants only)Instructions: Sending Official Transcripts to HAMPCAS ( for MHA applicants applying through HAMPCAS; not SOPHAS\nSpecial instructions for study abroad transcripts:Instructions: Study Abroad-SOPHAS ApplicantsInstructions: Study Abroad-DICAS Applicants (MSPH in Human Nutrition-Dietitian applicants only)Instructions: Study Abroad-HAMPCAS Applicants  ( for MHA applicants applying through HAMPCAS; not SOPHAS)\nIf you are an international student or a U.S. student who is/has studied outside the U.S. or English Speaking Canada—except for studying abroad—your international academic records must undergo a credentials evaluation. More information: International Applicants.\nStandardized test score requirements are determined by each academic program.\nPlease carefully review your program's requirements to determine which test scores are required, optional, or not required/not reviewed.\nFor International Applicants, an English proficiency test score (TOEFL, IELTS, Duolingo English, Pearson Test for English) is required.\nPlease carefully review the School's score minimums, test submission instructions, and exemptions.\nLetters of Recommendation must be submitted through the Application System (SOPHAS, SOPHAS Express, DICAS, or HAMPCAS) portal by the recommender themselves. Letters may come from professional or academic references, or a mix of both.\nOur admissions committees are aware that the letters of recommendation submitted through Application System are general and not specific to the program or school.\nMore information: Recommendations (SOPHAS Applicant Help Center)Recommendations (SOPHAS Express Applicant Help Center)Recommendations (DICAS Applicant Help Center)Recommendations (HAMPCAS Applicant Center)\nAll applicants will upload a resume or curriculum vitae to applicant system for there application (SOPHAS, SOPHAS Express, DICAS, or HAMPCAS).\nThe Statement of Purpose and Objectives is the applicant's opportunity to share with the admission committee their passion for public health, their interest in the program and research projects, and any other relevant information not included in the rest of the application.\nTIP 1: Start early for a smooth process.Many application components can take several months to prepare, and the application systems requires 4–6 weeks to verify your application. While we only require that your application be submitted by the deadline, we recommend starting early. This way, you’ll have plenty of time to ensure that all your materials are complete and submitted well in advance of the deadline.\nTIP 2: Submit all transcripts.To ensure a complete and thorough review of your application, we ask that you submit all of your transcripts from the institution that issued the credit. If you have a transfer or high school dual enrollment credit showing on another transcript, you still must report the institution that provided original credit in your Application System's Academic History and send that transcript to the Application System (SOPHAS, DICAS, or HAMPCAS). Even if some credits might seem irrelevant to the program, it’s important to include everything.\nTIP 3: Plan ahead for the Credential Evaluation (required for all international coursework).The  Credential Evaluation process can take some time, so it’s important to begin early to avoid any delays in reviewing your application. Completing this evaluation is an essential step for international degree holders, and it’s required for us to fully assess your academic background. It's important to note that the Bloomberg School requires the  Credential Evaluation for all international coursework (even if your Application System portal lists it as optional).\nThe programs listed below have application instructions that differ from the guidance on this page. Please review your program's instructions carefully to ensure you're submitting your application and supporting documents correctly.\nUndergraduate students at Johns Hopkins University who are already interested in pursuing advanced degrees can get a head start through the Bachelor's/Master's combined degree programs at the Bloomberg School.\nApplicants interested in attending a limited number of courses should use the non-degree applications below:\nApplying for a postdoctoral fellowship varies by department.

If you have a transfer or high school dual enrollment credit showing on another transcript, you still must report the institution that provided original credit in your Application System's Academic History and send that transcript to the Application System (SOPHAS, DICAS, or HAMPCAS). Even if some credits might seem irrelevant to the program, it’s important to include everything.TIP 3: Plan ahead for the Credential Evaluation (required for all international coursework).The  Credential Evaluation process can take some time, so it’s important to begin early to avoid any delays in reviewing your application. Completing this evaluation is an essential step for international degree holders, and it’s required for us to fully assess your academic background.
