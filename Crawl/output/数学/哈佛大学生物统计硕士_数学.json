Contact mph@hsph.harvard.edu.\nThe MPH in Nutrition equips students with a robust understanding of the current evidence in nutrition research and empowers them with practical tools for use in diverse professional settings.\nStudents will gain a conceptual and mechanistic understanding of the role nutrition plays in health and well-being and learn to translate research findings into effective policies and practice. Through coursework in biostatistics, epidemiology, and other quantitative disciplines, students will also develop skills to critically evaluate and apply scientific evidence to inform their translational work. Students are encouraged to choose elective courses to develop a focus for their expertise, such as nutrition policy, health disparities, nutrition epidemiology, global health, precision nutrition, and planetary health.\nThe program prepares students for positions in the public, nonprofit, or private sectors, working as public health or medical nutrition researchers or practitioners, policy advocates, project or program managers, or consultants in public health and health care organizations. This field of study also enables those already established in health care careers to strengthen their nutrition knowledge to enhance their clinical or public health practice.\nOn Campus (Fall start) • Full-time (1 year) • Part-time (2 years)\nMPH core requirements:\nApplied practice experience and integrative learning experience:\nField of study requirements:\nCommitted, Accomplished, Collaborative\nAs a Harvard Chan MPH student, you will work in a collaborative classroom environment alongside talented students from around the world and from a variety of academic and professional backgrounds.
