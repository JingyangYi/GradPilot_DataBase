This Fall 2025, we are happy to welcome our tenth cohort to UCLA. The Master of Applied Statistics (MAS) program was created in the Fall of 2016 in response to the increasingly high demand from students seeking a master’s degree in data science and quantitative analytics. The program evolved from MAS to Master of Applied Statistics & Data Science (MASDS) in Spring 2023 to accurately reflect the program and department’s mission to develop data scientists. The MASDS program now has the highest job placement rate of any UCLA Self-Supporting Program, and is also the most exclusive (highest applicant to enrollment ratio)!\nThe Master of Applied Statistics & Data Science (MASDS) program was created in response to the rapid rise in demand for data-centric skills in the Los Angeles area. Recent changes in the economy and the growing reliance of businesses and government agencies on data have created an increased demand for workers who can manage data and produce informative visualizations of data, and are guided by fundamental statistical principles. The MASDS will help meet this need by providing working professionals the means to obtain a first-rate postgraduate-level education in applied statistics and quantitative analytics. The MASDS is designed for working professionals, and as a result, courses will be offered in the evening to allow timely completion of the program. In addition the program is perfect for those who wish to transition to a more quantitatively focused career. All classes will be taught by regular departmental faculty. The degree will require a thesis project that will involve working closely with an industry partner and a faculty member to solve a real scientific or business problem. This will often be in the field where the student is working, thus deepening their understanding of it. The Department has various business, industry and government partners to provide internships, thesis topics, support for their employees, and job prospects for graduating students.\nThe deadline to submit applications for Fall 2026 is February 1, 2026.\nFor the next MASDS Information Session, RSVP here.\nApplications will be open around October 2025\n• UCLA’s Master of Applied Statistics & Data Science programApplications for the 2024-2025 class will open sometime in October 2023.

Designed by UCLA’s world-class statistics faculty, the program blends the fundamental ideas of quantitative analysis with a modern computational science approach. Graduates of the program will have mastered the principles of statistics and be ready to apply them in a broad range of areas. This balance will make graduates highly valuable to employers needing quantitative or data science skills. A MASDS degree from UCLA is the stepping stone for advancement in our increasingly data-centric world.\nProgram Description\nMASDS students must earn a minimum of 44 units of course credit. MASDS students will enroll in the 400 level courses. As of Fall of 2022, the Master of Applied Statistics & Data Science program has a set of seven required core courses. In addition, students will choose at least four electives that emphasize statistical modeling and programming. A written thesis is the final requirement.\nNote: MASDS students may choose to take up to two courses per quarter, including the summer, to complete their total of 11 courses. If this path is chosen, students typically complete the program in 21 months, with a minimum time of 18 months (6 quarters) and a maximum of 30 months (10 quarters).\nDifferences Between the MS and MASDS Programs\nUCLA Statistics also offers a Master of Science (MS) program. The MS program focuses more on theoretical statistics. It is an 18-month to 24-month program that requires students to be full-time by requiring a minimum of 12 units per quarter. In contrast, the focus of the MASDS program is applied statistics and data science. Most classes will be scheduled in the evening to make it easier for students who are concurrently working professionals. Students in the MASDS program may choose to take 1 or more courses as long as they complete the program within 36 months. International students in the MASDS must take a minimum of 8 units (2 classes) per quarter to be regarded as full-time for student visa purposes. The typical load for MAS students is 8 units (2 classes) per quarter.\nCore Courses\nFor students entering prior to Fall 2022\nThe core consists of the following six courses in statistical theory and methods:\n400 Introduction to Probability Models\n401 Survey of Methods in Modern Statistics\n402 Applied Regression\n403 Mathematical Statistics\n404 Statistical Computing and Programming\n405 Data Management\nAmong the core courses, only 401 may be waived upon departmental approval.\nFor students entering in Fall 2022\nThe core consists of the following seven courses in statistical theory and methods.\n400 Introduction to Probability Models\n401 Survey of Methods in Modern Statistics\n402 Applied Regression\n403 Mathematical Statistics\n404 Statistical Computing and Programming\n405 Data Management\n421 Advanced Statistical Communication\nAmong the core courses, only 401 may be waived upon departmental approval. If 401 is waived, the student must complete an additional elective course to satisfy the 44 unit requirement.\nFor students entering in Fall 2023 and beyond\nAmong the core courses, a course may be waived by request if the Director determines the student has already completed equivalent coursework. A maximum of 3 core courses may be waived. The Director with consultation from the MASDS governance committee will review student transcripts, syllabi, and other relevant materials to evaluate whether or not the student has already learned the bulk of the material taught in the courses. For a waiver to be considered, the prior coursework taken would need to be equivalent to the graduate level. For every course waived, the student must complete additional elective courses to satisfy the 44 unit requirement.\nElective Courses\nStudents must choose at least five distinct courses (a total of 20 units) from 400 level courses that are distinct from the core courses excluding the 496 and 498 (Internship and Master’s Thesis Research courses). The following is a list of elective courses (not all of them will be offered in each year):\n411 Multivariate Statistical Analysis\n412 Advanced Regression and Predictive Modeling\n413 Machine Learning\n414 Computer Intensive Methods\n415 Introduction to Forecasting\n416 Applied Geostatistics\n417 Statistical Models in Finance\n418 Tools in Data Science\n419 Experimental Design\n420 Causal Inference in Social Science Practice\n421A Introductory Statistical Communication\n421B Advanced Statistical Communication\n422 Data Visualization\n423 Longitudinal Data Analysis\n424 Teamwork & Leadership in Data Science\n425 Text Mining\nOnly 4 units of Stats 497 (Individual Studies) will count towards the required electives.\nFor students entering in Fall 2022 or later\nStudents must choose at least four distinct courses (a total of 16 units) from 400 level courses that are distinct from the core courses, or among the following list when offered. 498 Master’s Thesis Research courses may not count as an elective. Only 4 units of Stats 497 (Individual Studies) may count towards the required electives. 4 units of Stats 496 (Statistics Internship) may also count towards the required electives upon approval of the M.A.S. Director.\n411 Multivariate Statistical Analysis\n412 Advanced Regression and Predictive Modeling\n413 Machine Learning\n414 Computer Intensive Methods\n415 Introduction to Forecasting\n416 Applied Geostatistics\n417 Statistical Models in Finance\n418 Tools in Data Science\n419 Experimental Design\n420 Causal Inference in Social Science Practice\n422 Data Visualization\n423 Longitudinal Data Analysis\n424 Teamwork & Leadership in Data Science\n425 Text Mining\nData Scientists in action: The Thesis\nAll students will complete a thesis, which will report on research and analysis done under the supervision of both a faculty member and an industry partner when available. While students may work with proprietary data, industry partners must agree that the student can publish and distribute the thesis. The thesis must consist of an original analysis that solves a real-world problem. A faculty adviser of the Department of Statistics & Data Science will supervise the thesis project, who will ensure the statistical integrity of the analysis. Most thesis topics will originate from industry partners, who will propose topics and provide data sets. In these cases, a representative of the industry partner will work with the student and the faculty adviser to ensure that the solution provided in the thesis is satisfactory to the industry partner.\nWaiving Courses\nPlease complete the following form and submit with the required documents before enrolling in a course to: masds-office@stat.ucla.edu.\nIf your waiver is approved, please select the appropriate number of electives to replace all courses waived.\nStatistics 496 Internship/Elective\nIf you would like to use a work project or Internship as an elective course, please complete this form and after it is approved and signed by one of our faculty members, please submit the form to masds-office@stat.ucla.edu so that the course can be created and you can enroll once it’s approved.

Designed by UCLA’s world-class statistics faculty, the program blends the fundamental ideas of quantitative analysis with a modern computational science approach. Graduates of the program will have mastered the principles of statistics and be ready to apply them in a broad range of areas. This balance will make graduates highly valuable to employers needing quantitative or data science skills. A MASDS degree from UCLA is the stepping stone for advancement in our increasingly data-centric world.\nProgram Description\nMASDS students must earn a minimum of 44 units of course credit. MASDS students will enroll in the 400 level courses. As of Fall of 2022, the Master of Applied Statistics & Data Science program has a set of seven required core courses. In addition, students will choose at least four electives that emphasize statistical modeling and programming. A written thesis is the final requirement.\nNote: MASDS students may choose to take up to two courses per quarter, including the summer, to complete their total of 11 courses. If this path is chosen, students typically complete the program in 21 months, with a minimum time of 18 months (6 quarters) and a maximum of 30 months (10 quarters).\nDifferences Between the MS and MASDS Programs\nUCLA Statistics also offers a Master of Science (MS) program. The MS program focuses more on theoretical statistics. It is an 18-month to 24-month program that requires students to be full-time by requiring a minimum of 12 units per quarter. In contrast, the focus of the MASDS program is applied statistics and data science. Most classes will be scheduled in the evening to make it easier for students who are concurrently working professionals. Students in the MASDS program may choose to take 1 or more courses as long as they complete the program within 36 months. International students in the MASDS must take a minimum of 8 units (2 classes) per quarter to be regarded as full-time for student visa purposes. The typical load for MAS students is 8 units (2 classes) per quarter.\nCore Courses\n\n\nFor students entering prior to Fall 2022The core consists of the following six courses in statistical theory and methods:\n400 Introduction to Probability Models\n401 Survey of Methods in Modern Statistics\n402 Applied Regression\n403 Mathematical Statistics\n404 Statistical Computing and Programming\n405 Data Management\nAmong the core courses, only 401 may be waived upon departmental approval.\n\nFor students entering in Fall 2022The core consists of the following seven courses in statistical theory and methods.\n400 Introduction to Probability Models\n401 Survey of Methods in Modern Statistics\n402 Applied Regression\n403 Mathematical Statistics\n404 Statistical Computing and Programming\n405 Data Management\n421 Advanced Statistical Communication\nAmong the core courses, only 401 may be waived upon departmental approval. If 401 is waived, the student must complete an additional elective course to satisfy the 44 unit requirement.\n\nFor students entering in Fall 2023 and beyondThe core consists of the following seven courses in statistical theory and methods.\n400 Introduction to Probability Models\n401 Survey of Methods in Modern Statistics\n402 Applied Regression\n403 Mathematical Statistics\n404 Statistical Computing and Programming\n405 Data Management\n421 Advanced Statistical Communication\nAmong the core courses, a course may be waived by request if the Director determines the student has already completed equivalent coursework. A maximum of 3 core courses may be waived. The Director with consultation from the MASDS governance committee will review student transcripts, syllabi, and other relevant materials to evaluate whether or not the student has already learned the bulk of the material taught in the courses. For a waiver to be considered, the prior coursework taken would need to be equivalent to the graduate level. For every course waived, the student must complete additional elective courses to satisfy the 44 unit requirement.\n\n\nElective Courses\n\n\nFor students entering prior to Fall 2022Students must choose at least five distinct courses (a total of 20 units) from 400 level courses that are distinct from the core courses excluding the 496 and 498 (Internship and Master’s Thesis Research courses). The following is a list of elective courses (not all of them will be offered in each year):\n411 Multivariate Statistical Analysis\n412 Advanced Regression and Predictive Modeling\n413 Machine Learning\n414 Computer Intensive Methods\n415 Introduction to Forecasting\n416 Applied Geostatistics\n417 Statistical Models in Finance\n418 Tools in Data Science\n419 Experimental Design\n420 Causal Inference in Social Science Practice\n421A Introductory Statistical Communication\n421B Advanced Statistical Communication\n422 Data Visualization\n423 Longitudinal Data Analysis\n424 Teamwork & Leadership in Data Science\n425 Text Mining\nOnly 4 units of Stats 497 (Individual Studies) will count towards the required electives.\n\nFor students entering in Fall 2022 or laterStudents must choose at least four distinct courses (a total of 16 units) from 400 level courses that are distinct from the core courses, or among the following list when offered. 498 Master’s Thesis Research courses may not count as an elective. Only 4 units of Stats 497 (Individual Studies) may count towards the required electives. 4 units of Stats 496 (Statistics Internship) may also count towards the required electives upon approval of the M.A.S. Director.\n411 Multivariate Statistical Analysis\n412 Advanced Regression and Predictive Modeling\n413 Machine Learning\n414 Computer Intensive Methods\n415 Introduction to Forecasting\n416 Applied Geostatistics\n417 Statistical Models in Finance\n418 Tools in Data Science\n419 Experimental Design\n420 Causal Inference in Social Science Practice\n422 Data Visualization\n423 Longitudinal Data Analysis\n424 Teamwork & Leadership in Data Science\n425 Text Mining\n\n\nData Scientists in action: The Thesis\nAll students will complete a thesis, which will report on research and analysis done under the supervision of both a faculty member and an industry partner when available. While students may work with proprietary data, industry partners must agree that the student can publish and distribute the thesis. The thesis must consist of an original analysis that solves a real-world problem. A faculty adviser of the Department of Statistics & Data Science will supervise the thesis project, who will ensure the statistical integrity of the analysis.
