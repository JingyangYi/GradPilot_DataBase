Here the students not only learn to understand the presented matter, they also acquire skills to practice mathematics independently. Therefore the lectures require more personal contributions.\nAfter one year of in-depth studies, the Master's programme ends with a five-months Master's thesis, which does not focus on the mere understanding of mathematical concepts and methods anymore, but requires their independent advancement.\nWith the Master's degree students acquire the full qualification of a scientifically trained mathematician.\n90 ECTS | 1.5 years\nMaster of Science ETH in Mathematics Master of Science ETH in Applied Mathematics\nBachelor‘s degree programmes in Mathematics\nDownload MSc Mathematics/Applied Mathematics (PDF, 220 KB)\nMaster's degree programme Mathematics/Applied Mathematics\nETH Zurich\n                    Department of Mathematics\n                    Raemistrasse 101\n                HG G 33.2\n                8092 \n                Zurich\n            Switzerland\nETH Zurich\n                    Department of Mathematics\n                    Raemistrasse 101\n                HG G 33.2\n                8092 \n                Zurich\n            Schweiz\n• Homepage\n• Navigation\n• Search\n• Content\n• Footer\n• Contact\n• Sitemap\n• Phone\n                        +41 44 633 89 52\n[CARD]\nContact\nQuestions about the programme: Dr. Andreas Steiger, Dr. Seraina Wachter\n\n\n\nPhone\n                        +41 44 633 89 52\n\n\n\n\n\n            ETH Zurich\n                    Department of Mathematics\n                    Raemistrasse 101\n                HG G 33.2\n                8092 \n                Zurich\n            Switzerland\n\n\n\n\n\n              Show more\n\n              Show less\n[CARD]\nContact\n[CARD]\nQuestions about the programme: Dr. Andreas Steiger, Dr. Seraina Wachter\n\n\n\nPhone\n                        +41 44 633 89 52\n\n\n\n\n\n            ETH Zurich\n                    Department of Mathematics\n                    Raemistrasse 101\n                HG G 33.2\n                8092 \n                Zurich\n            Switzerland\n\n\n\n\n\n              Show more\n\n              Show less\n[CARD]\nQuestions about the programme: Dr. Andreas Steiger, Dr. Seraina Wachter\n[CARD]\nPhone\n                        +41 44 633 89 52\n[CARD]\nETH Zurich\n                    Department of Mathematics\n                    Raemistrasse 101\n                HG G 33.2\n                8092 \n                Zurich\n            Switzerland\n[CARD]\nShow more\n\n              Show less\n[CARD]\nQuestions about admission: Dr. Andreas Steiger\n\n\n\nPhone\n                        +41 44 633 89 52\n\n\n\n\n\n            ETH Zurich\n                    Department of Mathematics\n                    Raemistrasse 101\n                HG G 33.2\n                8092 \n                Zurich\n            Schweiz\n\n\n\n\n\n              Show more\n\n              Show less\n[CARD]\nQuestions about admission: Dr. Andreas Steiger\n[CARD]\nETH Zurich\n                    Department of Mathematics\n                    Raemistrasse 101\n                HG G 33.2\n                8092 \n                Zurich\n            Schweiz",

A Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and very good grades are expected. Students with a degree in a different field can enter if they have studied an equivalent amount of mathematics. Detailed information can be found in the Download requirement profile (PDF, 220 KB).\nThe diploma requires in total 90 credit points: 60 credits from courses, seminars, and semester theses, and 30 credits from the Master's thesis. Students usually need three or four semesters to finish our programme. The programme and its course requirements are described in detail in the Download Study guide (PDF, 525 KB) which provides more context to the legally binding Download Programme Regulations (PDF, 388 KB).\nIn this programme, students can choose freely from a wide range of core and elective courses. Attending at least one seminar is required, and there is the option to write a semester thesis. Both pure and applied mathematics can be studied in this programme.\nIn this programme, students take core and elective courses in applied mathematics and choose a specialization in one of many application areas. Writing at least one semester thesis in the field of the application area is mandatory, and there is the option to take a student seminar. A limited amount of courses in pure mathematics can also be taken.\nCourses are structured into focus areas. They are no official part of the degree, but it is suggested that students focus their studies in a specific direction. These tracks should help to focus; they will not be mentioned on the diploma certificate.  For more details on the available lectures in both programmes please consult the list of courses offered by the Department and the ETH Course Catalogue (Programme: Mathematics Master).\nEven though students will be asked to apply for one of the two programmes, the application process is exactly the same. The admission committee will consider all applications for both programmes in the same way. An accepted application is valid for both programmes, and students can switch from one to the other during their studies.\nAll information about the application process can be found on the Master's application website. This includes information about qualifying degrees, required documents, language certificates, application fees, etc. Please note that for an application in this programme, next to the common list of documents, we also ask for the programme-specific topics list. Students with a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from ETH Zurich can transfer unconditionally into this programme and do not need to apply.\nETH offers different kinds of financial aids. Excellent students are invited to apply for the merit-based Excellence Scholarship & Opportunity Programme (ESOP).\nIn exceptional cases, the Department offers the option to include the Master's programme into a doctoral study programme. Students complete the regular course work and usually integrate their Master's thesis into their doctoral dissertation. To apply for the Direct Doctorate, students need to find a supervisor themselves. During the application process, they will be asked to provide a written confirmation by their supervisor. For more details on the Direct Doctorate see Appendix 2 of the Download Programme Regulations (PDF, 388 KB).\nMost questions should be answered on one of the various pages linked on this site.
