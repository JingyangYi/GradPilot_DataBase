You’ll learn to implement and interpret the appropriate analytic methods or methodological alternatives to calculate key measures of association in public health research studies.\nWhen you graduate with the Biostatistics concentration, you’ll be prepared to take on leadership roles in public health settings around the globe. You’ll stand out to employers with a skillset that has both breadth and depth, including the following competencies.\nYou will benefit from countless opportunities to build skills and experience to prepare you for successful careers in public health and biostatistics. There are many professional development opportunities available to you at NYU GPH, including internships, fellowships, employment, volunteer opportunities, professional association membership, and more.\nGPH-GU 2030 Introduction to Global Health (2) [F, S]GPH-GU 2106 Epidemiology (3) [F, S]GPH-GU 2110 Health Care Policy (2) [F, S, Su]GPH-GU 2112 Public Health Management and Leadership (2) [F, S, Su]GPH-GU 2140 Global Issues in Social and Behavioral Health (3)  [F, S]GPH-GU 2153 Global Environmental Health (3)  [F, S, Su]GPH-GU 2995 Biostatistics for Public Health (3)  [F, S, Su]GPH-GU 5171 Global Health Informatics Workshop (0)  [F]GPH-GU 5170 Introduction to Public Health (0) [F, S]\nAll students in the Biostatistics concentration must take the following courses (6 credits):GPH-GU 2353 Regression I: Linear Regression and Modeling (3) [F, S]GPH-GU 2354 Regression II: Categorical Data Analysis (3) [F]Selective courses (9) students choose from each of the following sets of courses below.
