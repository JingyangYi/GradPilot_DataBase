The minimum English language requirement for entry to an Adelaide University undergraduate program is an International English Language Testing System (IELTS) Academic overall score of 6.0 or equivalent. However, English language entry requirements are degree specific, and some degrees have higher English language requirements. This means the exact requirement will depend upon the degree you are applying to. Please visit the degree page for more information. \nYou can demonstrate your level of English language proficiency by providing the results of an accepted English language test (e.g. IELTS, PTE), taken within the last two years prior to admission. In some cases, you can also meet minimum language requirements using your previous academic qualifications (e.g. a Diploma completed in Australia) or through practical application of your English skills in a professional environment. Where previous study/work experience was conducted in English, the application must be accompanied by certified documentation from the educational institution/employer certifying that the language of instruction/employment was English.  \nIf you don’t meet the minimum English language requirements, you can still apply for a program and if you meet the academic eligibility requirements for admission, we can send you a conditional offer packaged with an English language preparatory program from our English Language Centre.\nProof of English language proficiency, in addition to the academic entry requirements, does not guarantee a place at Adelaide University. Applications are considered on an individual basis and selection is competitive.\nMore information   \nFor a comprehensive list of all English language tests accepted by Adelaide University, please visit the English language proficiency page.\n[CARD]\nThe Genuine Student (GS) requirement is an Australian Government integrity measure that applies to all student visa applicants. It considers whether the individual circumstances of a student indicate that their intention is to stay in Australia specifically for study. \nAll applicants for a student visa must be a genuine applicant for entry. They must stay as a student and be able to show an understanding that studying in Australia is the primary reason of their student visa. The GS requirement is intended to include students who, after studying in Australia, develop skills Australia needs and who then go on to apply for permanent residence. \nYour offer may include a condition requiring satisfaction of Adelaide University’s Genuine Student requirement. We will undertake further checks of your application and you may be asked to book and complete an interview as part of this process.\n[CARD]\nAdelaide University must also be satisfied that you are able to financially support yourself and your accompanying family (if you have dependants) while you are studying. This means that you must be able to meet the cost of tuition fees and your living expenses, and that you understand that you will not be able to ask the University to waive your tuition fees, or pay any of your costs while you are living in Australia.\nView non-tuition fees",
