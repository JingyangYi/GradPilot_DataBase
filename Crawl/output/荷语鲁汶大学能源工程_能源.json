There is extensive coverage of the possibilities and limitations of various energy technologies, but also of the environmental consequences and economic aspects. The multidisciplinary MSc in Engineering: Energy prepares you for jobs related to research and development, policy and management, and industrial applications.\nThe first year consists of electrical and mechanical engineering courses, as well as more general techno-economic, energy-related subjects and integrated problem solving and projects.\nIn the second year, you continue your specialisation by, among other things, writing a master's thesis on a subject related to electrical energy, thermomechanical energy, or techno-economic aspects.\nYou follow one of three options:\nYou can also participate in an international exchange or do an internship.\nYour programme\nThe Faculty of Engineering Science at KU Leuven is involved in several Erasmus exchange programmes.

Be sure to check out the specific admission requirements (diploma requirements, language requirements and possible additional requirements). The only way to know whether you can be admitted to any of our programmes is by applying and completing the application process.\nOfficial and current admission requirements\nYou have a bachelor in engineering, specialised in mechanical engineering, electrical power engineering or a broad-based combination of electro-mechanical engineering.\nFor the most recent - and only official information - on application deadlines, check the application window for this programme.\nCheck the information on how to apply for this programme. There is also a video that explains the application procedure from start to finish.\nIt is worth noting that our tuition fees are more affordable than many other leading universities thanks to generous government financing of higher education in Belgium. The fees for any individual student are contingent upon their academic programme and the nationality of the student.\nFor the most recent – and only official information – on the tuition fees, check the tuition fee calculator.\nKU Leuven offers a variety of scholarships for qualifying students. Just as with our tuition fees, these scholarships may be contingent on a student’s academic programme or nationality, so be sure to thoroughly check eligibility requirements before applying.\nThe study costs consist of the yearly tuition fee on the one hand, and degree specific costs on the other hand. Beside study costs you also need to take living and transportation expenses into account.\nNewly graduated Energy engineers usually start their careers in predominantly technical jobs in areas such as design and development, operation and maintenance of power generation and energy conversion systems, quality control, system integration, logistical and technical-commercial positions, and technical advice (consulting). As their careers progress, many engineers move into management positions while others head up consultant engineering firms and research centres.\nThe MSc in Engineering: Energy prepares you for a career in a technical-industrial setting. You will gain extensive knowledge of energy technologies, but will also have insight into global environmental issues, sustainability, and economic aspects. This broad programme prepares you for jobs that are technical / technological, but also for jobs related to policy and management.\nThe Energy engineering programme has national and international outflow possibilities to the research, policy, industrial, and service sectors, as long as energy plays a key role – a role that, in any case, is becoming more important by the day.\nOur Student Career Center and our student organisation VTK are both happy to put you on the right track towards your first work experience.

For the Master of Engineering: Energy, this means that you can complete one or two semesters abroad, at a number of selected universities.\nGoing abroad\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternship\nThe Faculty of Engineering Science offers two types of internships in all its master’s programmes: Industrial Experience and Industrial Internships.\nEngineering internships\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWebinar\nRewatch the webinar about the Faculty of Engineering Science programmes given on 28 November 2024. \nWebinar\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdmission and application\n\n\nAdmission requirements\nAll students who did not obtain their previous degree at an institution of the Flemish Community, must submit an application via the Admissions office. Be sure to check out the specific admission requirements (diploma requirements, language requirements and possible additional requirements). The only way to know whether you can be admitted to any of our programmes is by applying and completing the application process. \nOfficial and current admission requirements\nStudent profile\nYou have a bachelor in engineering, specialised in mechanical engineering, electrical power engineering or a broad-based combination of electro-mechanical engineering. \n\nYou combine a strong technological background in mechanical and electrical engineering, with an interest in one of today’s biggest challenges for society: ensuring a cost-efficient, reliable and clean energy provision.\nYou show interest in the mechanical, electrical and techno-economic aspects of our energy system’s transition. \n\nApplication window\nFor the most recent - and only official information - on application deadlines, check the application window for this programme.\nApplication procedure\nCheck the information on how to apply for this programme. There is also a video that explains the application procedure from start to finish.\n\n\nTuition fees\n\n\nTuition fees\nIt is worth noting that our tuition fees are more affordable than many other leading universities thanks to generous government financing of higher education in Belgium. The fees for any individual student are contingent upon their academic programme and the nationality of the student.  \nFor the most recent – and only official information – on the tuition fees, check the tuition fee calculator.\nScholarships\nKU Leuven offers a variety of scholarships for qualifying students. Just as with our tuition fees, these scholarships may be contingent on a student’s academic programme or nationality, so be sure to thoroughly check eligibility requirements before applying. \n\n\nStudy costs\n\n\nThe study costs consist of the yearly tuition fee on the one hand, and degree specific costs on the other hand. Beside study costs you also need to take living and transportation expenses into account. \n\ntuition fees\nspecific study costs for this degree\ncost of living in Belgium\n\n\n\nAfter graduation\n\n\n\n \n\nCareer perspectives\nNewly graduated Energy engineers usually start their careers in predominantly technical jobs in areas such as design and development, operation and maintenance of power generation and energy conversion systems, quality control, system integration, logistical and technical-commercial positions, and technical advice (consulting). As their careers progress, many engineers move into management positions while others head up consultant engineering firms and research centres.\nThe MSc in Engineering: Energy prepares you for a career in a technical-industrial setting. You will gain extensive knowledge of energy technologies, but will also have insight into global environmental issues, sustainability, and economic aspects. This broad programme prepares you for jobs that are technical / technological, but also for jobs related to policy and management.\nThe Energy engineering programme has national and international outflow possibilities to the research, policy, industrial, and service sectors, as long as energy plays a key role – a role that, in any case, is becoming more important by the day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCareer support\nOur Student Career Center and our student organisation VTK are both happy to put you on the right track towards your first work experience.

As their careers progress, many engineers move into management positions while others head up consultant engineering firms and research centres.\nThe MSc in Engineering: Energy prepares you for a career in a technical-industrial setting. You will gain extensive knowledge of energy technologies, but will also have insight into global environmental issues, sustainability, and economic aspects. This broad programme prepares you for jobs that are technical / technological, but also for jobs related to policy and management.\nThe Energy engineering programme has national and international outflow possibilities to the research, policy, industrial, and service sectors, as long as energy plays a key role – a role that, in any case, is becoming more important by the day.\n[CARD]\nCareer support\nOur Student Career Center and our student organisation VTK are both happy to put you on the right track towards your first work experience.
