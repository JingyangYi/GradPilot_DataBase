This two-year program integrates a strong foundation in healthcare management and policy analysis with a set of social values rooted in the discipline of public health. The broad, general healthcare management and policy curriculum addresses critical issues facing the U.S. healthcare system through coursework, as well as a field training component.\nIndividuals with a previous academic or professional doctoral-level degree who have already worked in healthcare for several years and wish to refine their health services skills may apply for the one-year program. Physicians, dentists, attorneys, social scientists, and other professionals enter this program to gain an understanding of the complexities and process of the healthcare system. This program provides individuals with a strong foundation in health services to complement and broaden their expertise in their functional area.\nA total of 78 quarter-credit units are needed to complete the program.\nTo supplement the classroom experience, students must complete a summer internship (10 weeks) with a health care organization. During the summer internship and in the fall quarter following, students prepare a written consulting report including a proposal, literature review, and policy implications. The consulting report will focus on an operational problem or decision identified during the summer placement. This might be any organizational issue, process management initiative, policy white paper, research project, strategic, business plan, or any of a number of analyses. Health care settings may include hospitals, managed care organizations, medical groups, government agencies or departments, consulting firms, community organizations, advocacy agencies, or related health settings. After completing their summer internship, students often work part-time at their summer placement site. Students enroll in HLT POL 400 in the fall quarter to successfully complete the summer internship requirement and consulting report.\nThe curriculum consists of a three-term sequence of academic coursework, followed by a summer field work placement of at least ten weeks, followed by a final three terms of further academic coursework.\nThe MPH degree is typically obtained after two academic years (six quarters of full-time study), including a required 400-hour internship, usually completed in the summer between the first and second years.\nView a list of faculty in the Department of Health Policy and Management.\nStudents graduate with a comprehensive knowledge base to understand the implications of the field as well as a set of skills and competencies to apply in furtherance of moving us toward a more efficient, equitable and quality health care system.\nExamples of positions held by graduates include:\nFor the most up to date fees and more information on fee breakdown, visit the registrar's office.\nPlease see the cost and aid section of our website for information on awards, scholarships, training opportunities, employment, summer internship funding, and need-based aid. Please note that opportunities listed under 'Summer Internship Funding' are only applicable to MPH students.\nIn addition to meeting the University’s minimum requirements, prior work experience in a hospital or clinical setting is strongly considered in the evaluation of applicants for admission.\nVisit the application guide to learn about our admissions process.\nThis information is intended as an overview, and should be used as a guide only.

It emphasizes the integration of theory and research in a focused substantive area (cognate). This includes classroom instruction; non-credit seminars; independent study; research projects; academic apprenticeships; and interaction with faculty, fellow students, and other professionals within and outside the UCLA campus.\nBecause each student has unique and specific interests, doctoral training is individualized to the needs and interests of the particular student.\nThe doctoral program encompasses the following major elements and stages:\nStudents must have a minimum of 17 courses (70 units). All students are required to specialize in a particular area of study, a cognate, which requires additional coursework. Of these, 11-12 courses (46-50 units) are required, five courses (20 units) are electives, and remaining units may be fulfilled with additional electives or from the cognate coursework.\nCognate studies give students a depth of knowledge in a field that is complementary to health policy and management. Students are required to take PhD level coursework that satisfies the requirements of at least one cognate. Students choose a cognate from areas such as economics, epidemiology, health care outcomes research, organizational behavior, and public policy studies, or may design their own cognate with a faculty member.\nStudents generally take the qualifying exam after the completion of all course work, usually in the beginning of their third year of doctoral studies. The purpose of the written qualifying exam is to prepare and evaluate students’ knowledge and application of a number of areas, and to assess students’ readiness to undertake independent research.\nThe dissertation proposal describes the student’s desired area of research, the methods that will be used to examine relevant data and how it will support the dissertation findings, and explain the dissertation’s contribution to the field.\nThe purpose of the dissertation proposal defense (also known as the oral qualifying examination) is twofold: 1) to evaluate the research being proposed for the dissertation and 2) to assess the student’s ability to conduct this research. The defense focuses on the proposal for the dissertation.\nThe dissertation reports the results of the research conducted based on the proposal. The dissertation should demonstrate the scientific merit of the work itself and the student’s mastery over its substance and methods. It must demonstrate that the student is qualified to conduct independent research.\nThe final oral examination is a defense of the dissertation. The purpose of this examination is twofold: 1) to evaluate the research conducted for the dissertation 2) to assess the student’s ability to conduct independent research. The exam focuses on the dissertation.\nThe PhD is generally obtained in four or five years.\nView a list of faculty in the Department of Health Policy and Management.\nMany graduates of the program pursue research and teaching careers in health care management and health policy analysis.\nExamples of position held by graduates include:\nFor the most up to date fees and more information on fee breakdown, visit the registrar's office.\nPlease see the cost and aid section of our website for information on awards, scholarships, training opportunities, employment, summer internship funding, and need-based aid. Please note that opportunities listed under 'Summer Internship Funding' are only applicable to MPH students.\nIn addition to meeting the University’s minimum requirements, the Department of Health Policy and Management recommends a master’s degree in public health or other appropriate graduate degree in a related field with a grade-point average of at least 3.5 for graduate studies. In addition, although not required for admission, research experience in the field is viewed favorably when competing applications are judged. Students do not need to identify a faculty mentor in order to apply for the program.\nVisit the application guide to learn about our admissions process.\nThis information is intended as an overview, and should be used as a guide only. Requirements, course offerings and other elements may change, and this overview may not list all details of the program.\nAdmission requirements listed are departmental requirements, and are in addition to the University's minimum requirements.

    \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause each student has unique and specific interests, doctoral training is individualized to the needs and interests of the particular student.\nThe doctoral program encompasses the following major elements and stages:\n\nCourse work in the major and cognate/minor fields\nWritten qualifying examination\nProposal for the dissertation\nOral qualifying examination on the proposal for the dissertation (advancement to candidacy)\nDissertation\nOral defense of the dissertation\n\nCourse Work\nStudents must have a minimum of 17 courses (70 units). All students are required to specialize in a particular area of study, a cognate, which requires additional coursework. Of these, 11-12 courses (46-50 units) are required, five courses (20 units) are electives, and remaining units may be fulfilled with additional electives or from the cognate coursework.\nRequired Courses (11-12 courses/44-50 units)\n\nHLT POL 200A: Health Systems Organization and Financing, I\nHLT POL 226A: Readings in Health Service Research (2 Units)\nHLT POL 226B: Readings in Health Service Research (2 Units)\nHLT POL 227B: Special Topics in Health Services\nHLT POL 225A: Health Services Research Design (6 Units)\nHLT POL 225B: Health Services Research Design (6 Units)\nHLT POL 423 Practices of Evaluation in Health Services\nHLT POL 237C: Health Services Research Methodology (6 Units)\nBIOSTATS 211A: Applied Regression\nBIOSTATS 211B: Applied Regression\nEPIDEM 100 or an equivalent introductory survey course or show proof of an equivalent graduate-level introductory epidemiology course that meets the requirements for an MPH, MS, PhD, or MD program\nOne (or more) additional statistics course (200-level or above) ONLY this additional statistics course may be taken on a Pass/No Pass basis. All other courses MUST be graded.\n\nElective Courses (5 courses/20 units)\n\nStudents select four or more elective courses\n\nCognate Requirements\nCognate studies give students a depth of knowledge in a field that is complementary to health policy and management. Students are required to take PhD level coursework that satisfies the requirements of at least one cognate. Students choose a cognate from areas such as economics, epidemiology, health care outcomes research, organizational behavior, and public policy studies, or may design their own cognate with a faculty member.\nQualifying Exam\nStudents generally take the qualifying exam after the completion of all course work, usually in the beginning of their third year of doctoral studies. The purpose of the written qualifying exam is to prepare and evaluate students’ knowledge and application of a number of areas, and to assess students’ readiness to undertake independent research.\nDissertation Proposal\nThe dissertation proposal describes the student’s desired area of research, the methods that will be used to examine relevant data and how it will support the dissertation findings, and explain the dissertation’s contribution to the field.\nDissertation Proposal Defense (Oral Qualifying Examination)\nThe purpose of the dissertation proposal defense (also known as the oral qualifying examination) is twofold: 1) to evaluate the research being proposed for the dissertation and 2) to assess the student’s ability to conduct this research. The defense focuses on the proposal for the dissertation.\nDissertation\nThe dissertation reports the results of the research conducted based on the proposal. The dissertation should demonstrate the scientific merit of the work itself and the student’s mastery over its substance and methods. It must demonstrate that the student is qualified to conduct independent research.\nDissertation Defense\nThe final oral examination is a defense of the dissertation. The purpose of this examination is twofold: 1) to evaluate the research conducted for the dissertation 2) to assess the student’s ability to conduct independent research. The exam focuses on the dissertation.\nTime To Degree\n      \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe PhD is generally obtained in four or five years.\nDepartment Faculty\n      \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView a list of faculty in the Department of Health Policy and Management.\n\nFaculty\nCareer Outcomes\n      \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany graduates of the program pursue research and teaching careers in health care management and health policy analysis.\nExamples of position held by graduates include:\n\nTenure-Track Faculty\nResearcher\nResearch Director\nTuition and Fees\n      \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the most up to date fees and more information on fee breakdown, visit the registrar's office.\nPlease see the cost and aid section of our website for information on awards, scholarships, training opportunities, employment, summer internship funding, and need-based aid. Please note that opportunities listed under 'Summer Internship Funding' are only applicable to MPH students.\n\nCost & Aid\nAdmissions\n      \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesired Qualifications\nIn addition to meeting the University’s minimum requirements, the Department of Health Policy and Management recommends a master’s degree in public health or other appropriate graduate degree in a related field with a grade-point average of at least 3.5 for graduate studies. In addition, although not required for admission, research experience in the field is viewed favorably when competing applications are judged.

Health care settings may include hospitals, managed care organizations, medical groups, government agencies or departments, consulting firms, community organizations, advocacy agencies, or related health settings. After completing their summer internship, students often work part-time at their summer placement site. Students enroll in HLT POL 400 in the fall quarter to successfully complete the summer internship requirement and consulting report.\nThe curriculum consists of a three-term sequence of academic coursework, followed by a summer field work placement of at least 10 weeks, followed by a final three terms of further academic coursework.

The consulting report will focus on an operational problem or decision identified during the summer placement. This might be any organizational issue, process management initiative, policy white paper, research project, strategic, business plan, or any of a number of analyses. Health care settings may include hospitals, managed care organizations, medical groups, government agencies or departments, consulting firms, community organizations, advocacy agencies, or related health settings. After completing their summer internship, students often work part-time at their summer placement site. Students enroll in HLT POL 400 in the fall quarter to successfully complete the summer internship requirement and consulting report.\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n            Typical Course Sequencing\n      \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe curriculum consists of a three-term sequence of academic coursework, followed by a summer field work placement of at least 10 weeks, followed by a final three terms of further academic coursework.

Applicants interested in the joint MPH/MBA program in the Department of Health Policy and Management may take either the GRE or GMAT. Applicants interested in this concurrent program should contact UCLA Anderson and the Department of Health Policy and Management at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health.\nThe MPH in Health Policy provides students with the skills to contribute to advancing the health of populations by improving the effectiveness and efficiency of personal and other health services in private and public health organizations. This two-year program integrates a strong foundation in healthcare management and policy analysis with a set of social values rooted in the discipline of public health. The broad, general healthcare management and policy curriculum addresses critical issues facing the U.S. healthcare system through coursework, as well as a field training component.\nIndividuals with a previous academic or professional doctoral-level degree who have already worked in healthcare for several years and wish to refine their health services skills may apply for the one-year program. Physicians, dentists, attorneys, social scientists, and other professionals enter this program to gain an understanding of the complexities and process of the healthcare system. This program provides individuals with a strong foundation in health services to complement and broaden their expertise in their functional area.\nA total of 78 quarter-credit units are needed to complete the program.\nTo supplement the classroom experience, students must complete a summer internship (10 weeks) with a health care organization. During the summer internship and in the fall quarter following, students prepare a written consulting report including a proposal, literature review, and policy implications. The consulting report will focus on an operational problem or decision identified during the summer placement. This might be any organizational issue, process management initiative, policy white paper, research project, strategic, business plan, or any of a number of analyses. Health care settings may include hospitals, managed care organizations, medical groups, government agencies or departments, consulting firms, community organizations, advocacy agencies, or related health settings. After completing their summer internship, students often work part-time at their summer placement site. Students enroll in HLT POL 400 in the fall quarter to successfully complete the summer internship requirement and consulting report.\nThe curriculum consists of a three-term sequence of academic coursework, followed by a summer field work placement of at least ten weeks, followed by a final three terms of further academic coursework.\nThe MPH degree is typically obtained after two academic years (six quarters of full-time study), including a required 400-hour internship, usually completed in the summer between the first and second years.\nView a list of faculty in the Department of Health Policy and Management.\nStudents graduate with a comprehensive knowledge base to understand the implications of the field as well as a set of skills and competencies to apply in furtherance of moving us toward a more efficient, equitable and quality health care system.\nExamples of positions held by graduates include:\nFor the most up to date fees and more information on fee breakdown, visit the registrar's office.\nPlease see the cost and aid section of our website for information on awards, scholarships, training opportunities, employment, summer internship funding, and need-based aid. Please note that opportunities listed under 'Summer Internship Funding' are only applicable to MPH students.\nIn addition to meeting the University’s minimum requirements, prior work experience in a hospital or clinical setting is strongly considered in the evaluation of applicants for admission.\nVisit the application guide to learn about our admissions process.\nThe information listed on this page includes information specific to the degree offered by UCLA Fielding. To learn about program requirements and other details specific to the MBA, please contact UCLA Anderson.\nThis information is intended as an overview, and should be used as a guide only.

The program includes three years at UCLA Law and one year at UCLA Fielding. Applicants interested in this concurrent program must apply separately to UCLA Law and the Office of Student Services at UCLA Fielding.\nThe MPH in Health Policy provides students with the skills to contribute to advancing the health of populations by improving the effectiveness and efficiency of personal and other health services in private and public health organizations. This two-year program integrates a strong foundation in healthcare management and policy analysis with a set of social values rooted in the discipline of public health. The broad, general healthcare management and policy curriculum addresses critical issues facing the U.S. healthcare system through coursework, as well as a field training component.\nIndividuals with a previous academic or professional doctoral-level degree who have already worked in healthcare for several years and wish to refine their health services skills may apply for the one-year program. Physicians, dentists, attorneys, social scientists, and other professionals enter this program to gain an understanding of the complexities and process of the healthcare system. This program provides individuals with a strong foundation in health services to complement and broaden their expertise in their functional area.\nA total of 78 quarter-credit units are needed to complete the program.\nTo supplement the classroom experience, students must complete a summer internship (10 weeks) with a health care organization. During the summer internship and in the fall quarter following, students prepare a written consulting report including a proposal, literature review, and policy implications. The consulting report will focus on an operational problem or decision identified during the summer placement. This might be any organizational issue, process management initiative, policy white paper, research project, strategic, business plan, or any of a number of analyses. Health care settings may include hospitals, managed care organizations, medical groups, government agencies or departments, consulting firms, community organizations, advocacy agencies, or related health settings. After completing their summer internship, students often work part-time at their summer placement site. Students enroll in HLT POL 400 in the fall quarter to successfully complete the summer internship requirement and consulting report.\nThe curriculum consists of a three-term sequence of academic coursework, followed by a summer field work placement of at least ten weeks, followed by a final three terms of further academic coursework.\nThe MPH degree is typically obtained after two academic years (six quarters of full-time study), including a required 400-hour internship, usually completed in the summer between the first and second years.\nView a list of faculty in the Department of Health Policy and Management.\nStudents graduate with a comprehensive knowledge base to understand the implications of the field as well as a set of skills and competencies to apply in furtherance of moving us toward a more efficient, equitable and quality health care system.\nExamples of positions held by graduates include:\nFor the most up to date fees and more information on fee breakdown, visit the registrar's office.\nPlease see the cost and aid section of our website for information on awards, scholarships, training opportunities, employment, summer internship funding, and need-based aid. Please note that opportunities listed under 'Summer Internship Funding' are only applicable to MPH students.\nIn addition to meeting the University’s minimum requirements, prior work experience in a hospital or clinical setting is strongly considered in the evaluation of applicants for admission.\nVisit the application guide to learn about our admissions process.\nThe information listed on this page includes information specific to the degree offered by UCLA Fielding. To learn about program requirements and other details specific to the JD, please contact the UCLA School of Law.\nThis information is intended as an overview, and should be used as a guide only.

The program includes four years of medical school, and one year and one additional quarter at UCLA Fielding. UCLA medical students apply to the MPH program in the Fall quarter of their junior (third) year. Students interested in this articulated program should contact the Student Affairs Office at the School of Medicine and the Office of Student Services at UCLA Fielding.\nThe MPH in Health Policy provides students with the skills to contribute to advancing the health of populations by improving the effectiveness and efficiency of personal and other health services in private and public health organizations. This two-year program integrates a strong foundation in healthcare management and policy analysis with a set of social values rooted in the discipline of public health. The broad, general healthcare management and policy curriculum addresses critical issues facing the U.S. healthcare system through coursework, as well as a field training component.\nIndividuals with a previous academic or professional doctoral-level degree who have already worked in healthcare for several years and wish to refine their health services skills may apply for the one-year program. Physicians, dentists, attorneys, social scientists, and other professionals enter this program to gain an understanding of the complexities and process of the healthcare system. This program provides individuals with a strong foundation in health services to complement and broaden their expertise in their functional area.\nA total of 78 quarter-credit units are needed to complete the program.\nTo supplement the classroom experience, students must complete a summer internship (10 weeks) with a health care organization. During the summer internship and in the fall quarter following, students prepare a written consulting report including a proposal, literature review, and policy implications. The consulting report will focus on an operational problem or decision identified during the summer placement. This might be any organizational issue, process management initiative, policy white paper, research project, strategic, business plan, or any of a number of analyses. Health care settings may include hospitals, managed care organizations, medical groups, government agencies or departments, consulting firms, community organizations, advocacy agencies, or related health settings. After completing their summer internship, students often work part-time at their summer placement site. Students enroll in HLT POL 400 in the fall quarter to successfully complete the summer internship requirement and consulting report.\nThe curriculum consists of a three-term sequence of academic coursework, followed by a summer field work placement of at least ten weeks, followed by a final three terms of further academic coursework.\nThe MPH degree is typically obtained after two academic years (six quarters of full-time study), including a required 400-hour internship, usually completed in the summer between the first and second years.\nView a list of faculty in the Department of Health Policy and Management.\nStudents graduate with a comprehensive knowledge base to understand the implications of the field as well as a set of skills and competencies to apply in furtherance of moving us toward a more efficient, equitable and quality health care system.\nExamples of positions held by graduates include:\nFor the most up to date fees and more information on fee breakdown, visit the registrar's office.\nPlease see the cost and aid section of our website for information on awards, scholarships, training opportunities, employment, summer internship funding, and need-based aid. Please note that opportunities listed under 'Summer Internship Funding' are only applicable to MPH students.\nIn addition to meeting the University’s minimum requirements, prior work experience in a hospital or clinical setting is strongly considered in the evaluation of applicants for admission.\nVisit the application guide to learn about our admissions process.\nThe information listed on this page includes information specific to the degree offered by UCLA Fielding. To learn about program requirements and other details specific to the MD, please contact the UCLA School of Medicine.\nThis information is intended as an overview, and should be used as a guide only.

Core Course Requirements in Public Health\n[HEADING] 3. Additional Course Requirements\n[HEADING] 4. Applied Practice Experience (APEx)\n[HEADING] Desired Qualifications\n[HEADING] Admissions Process\n[HEADING] Please note:\n[HEADING] Related Programs\nUCLA Fielding School of Public Health\nThe MPH in Health Policy and Management is a one-year program designed for individuals with a previous academic or professional doctoral-level degree who have already worked in health care for several years and wish to refine their health services skills and knowledge. Physicians, dentists, attorneys, social scientists, and other professionals enter this program to gain an understanding of the complexities and process of the health care system. This program provides individuals with a strong foundation in health services to complement and broaden their expertise in their functional area.\nThe program requires the completion of a minimum of 58 quarter-credit units.\nTo supplement the classroom experience, students must complete a summer internship (10 weeks) with a health care organization. During the summer internship and in the fall quarter following, students prepare a written consulting report including a proposal, literature review, and policy implications.

Applicants interested in the joint MPH/MBA program in the Department of Health Policy and Management may take either the GRE or GMAT. Applicants interested in this concurrent program should contact UCLA Anderson and the Department of Health Policy and Management at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health.\nThe MPH in Health Management provide students with the skills to contribute to advancing the health of populations by improving the effectiveness and efficiency of personal and other health services in private and public health organizations. This two-year program integrates a strong foundation in healthcare management and policy analysis with a set of social values rooted in the discipline of public health. The broad, general healthcare management and policy curriculum addresses critical issues facing the U.S. healthcare system through coursework, as well as a field training component.\nIndividuals with a previous academic or professional doctoral-level degree who have already worked in healthcare for several years and wish to refine their health services skills may apply for the one-year program. Physicians, dentists, attorneys, social scientists, and other professionals enter this program to gain an understanding of the complexities and process of the healthcare system. This program provides individuals with a strong foundation in health services to complement and broaden their expertise in their functional area.\nA total of 78 quarter-credit units are needed to complete the program.\nTo supplement the classroom experience, students must complete a summer internship (10 weeks) with a health care organization. During the summer internship and in the fall quarter following, students prepare a written consulting report including a proposal, literature review, and policy implications. The consulting report will focus on an operational problem or decision identified during the summer placement. This might be any organizational issue, process management initiative, policy white paper, research project, strategic, business plan, or any of a number of analyses. Health care settings may include hospitals, managed care organizations, medical groups, government agencies or departments, consulting firms, community organizations, advocacy agencies, or related health settings. After completing their summer internship, students often work part-time at their summer placement site. Students enroll in HLT POL 400 in the fall quarter to successfully complete the summer internship requirement and consulting report.\nThe curriculum consists of a three-term sequence of academic coursework, followed by a summer field work placement of at least ten weeks, followed by a final three terms of further academic coursework.\nThe MPH degree is typically obtained after two academic years (six quarters of full-time study), including a required 400-hour internship, usually completed in the summer between the first and second years.\nView a list of faculty in the Department of Health Policy and Management.\nStudents graduate with a comprehensive knowledge base to understand the implications of the field as well as a set of skills and competencies to apply in furtherance of moving us toward a more efficient, equitable and quality health care system.\nExamples of positions held by graduates include:\nFor the most up to date fees and more information on fee breakdown, visit the registrar's office.\nPlease see the cost and aid section of our website for information on awards, scholarships, training opportunities, employment, summer internship funding, and need-based aid. Please note that opportunities listed under 'Summer Internship Funding' are only applicable to MPH students.\nIn addition to meeting the University’s minimum requirements, prior work experience in a hospital or clinical setting is strongly considered in the evaluation of applicants for admission.\nVisit the application guide to learn about our admissions process.\nThe information listed on this page includes information specific to the degree offered by UCLA Fielding.

The program includes three years at UCLA Law and one year at UCLA Fielding. Applicants interested in this concurrent program must apply separately to UCLA Law and the Office of Student Services at UCLA Fielding.\nThe MPH in Health Management provide students with the skills to contribute to advancing the health of populations by improving the effectiveness and efficiency of personal and other health services in private and public health organizations. This two-year program integrates a strong foundation in healthcare management and policy analysis with a set of social values rooted in the discipline of public health. The broad, general healthcare management and policy curriculum addresses critical issues facing the U.S. healthcare system through coursework, as well as a field training component.\nIndividuals with a previous academic or professional doctoral-level degree who have already worked in healthcare for several years and wish to refine their health services skills may apply for the one-year program. Physicians, dentists, attorneys, social scientists, and other professionals enter this program to gain an understanding of the complexities and process of the healthcare system. This program provides individuals with a strong foundation in health services to complement and broaden their expertise in their functional area.\nA total of 78 quarter-credit units are needed to complete the program.\nTo supplement the classroom experience, students must complete a summer internship (10 weeks) with a health care organization. During the summer internship and in the fall quarter following, students prepare a written consulting report including a proposal, literature review, and policy implications. The consulting report will focus on an operational problem or decision identified during the summer placement. This might be any organizational issue, process management initiative, policy white paper, research project, strategic, business plan, or any of a number of analyses. Health care settings may include hospitals, managed care organizations, medical groups, government agencies or departments, consulting firms, community organizations, advocacy agencies, or related health settings. After completing their summer internship, students often work part-time at their summer placement site. Students enroll in HLT POL 400 in the fall quarter to successfully complete the summer internship requirement and consulting report.\nThe curriculum consists of a three-term sequence of academic coursework, followed by a summer field work placement of at least ten weeks, followed by a final three terms of further academic coursework.\nThe MPH degree is typically obtained after two academic years (six quarters of full-time study), including a required 400-hour internship, usually completed in the summer between the first and second years.\nView a list of faculty in the Department of Health Policy and Management.\nStudents graduate with a comprehensive knowledge base to understand the implications of the field as well as a set of skills and competencies to apply in furtherance of moving us toward a more efficient, equitable and quality health care system.\nExamples of positions held by graduates include:\nFor the most up to date fees and more information on fee breakdown, visit the registrar's office.\nPlease see the cost and aid section of our website for information on awards, scholarships, training opportunities, employment, summer internship funding, and need-based aid. Please note that opportunities listed under 'Summer Internship Funding' are only applicable to MPH students.\nIn addition to meeting the University’s minimum requirements, prior work experience in a hospital or clinical setting is strongly considered in the evaluation of applicants for admission.\nVisit the application guide to learn about our admissions process.\nThe information listed on this page includes information specific to the degree offered by UCLA Fielding. To learn about program requirements and other details specific to the JD, please contact the UCLA School of Law.\nThis information is intended as an overview, and should be used as a guide only.

Health care settings may include hospitals, managed care organizations, medical groups, government agencies or departments, consulting firms, community organizations, advocacy agencies, or related health settings.

Core Course Requirements in Public Health\n[HEADING] 3. Additional Course Requirements\n[HEADING] 4. Applied Practice Experience (APEx)\n[HEADING] Desired Qualifications\n[HEADING] Admissions Process\n[HEADING] Please note:\nUCLA Fielding School of Public Health\nThe MPH in Health Management provide students with the skills to contribute to advancing the health of populations by improving the effectiveness and efficiency of personal and other health services in private and public health organizations. This two-year program integrates a strong foundation in healthcare management and policy analysis with a set of social values rooted in the discipline of public health. The broad, general healthcare management and policy curriculum addresses critical issues facing the U.S. healthcare system through coursework, as well as an Applied Practice Experience (APEx) component.\nIndividuals with a previous academic or professional doctoral-level degree who have already worked in healthcare for several years and wish to refine their health services skills may apply for the one-year program. Physicians, dentists, attorneys, social scientists, and other professionals enter this program to gain an understanding of the complexities and process of the healthcare system. This program provides individuals with a strong foundation in health services to complement and broaden their expertise in their functional area.\nA total of 78 quarter-credit units are needed to complete the program.\nTo supplement the classroom experience, students must complete a summer internship (10 weeks) with a health care organization. During the summer internship and in the fall quarter following, students prepare a written consulting report including a proposal, literature review, and policy implications. The consulting report will focus on an operational problem or decision identified during the summer placement. This might be any organizational issue, process management initiative, policy white paper, research project, strategic, business plan, or any of a number of analyses.
