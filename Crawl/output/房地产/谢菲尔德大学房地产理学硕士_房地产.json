It focuses on the valuation of office, retail and industrial real estate, together comprising the most common type of commercial real estate, dominating the landscape of the built environment. The investment method of valuation, introduced in 'Applied Real Estate Valuation', is revisited and the basic principles are extended to allow a more advanced analysis of value. This is important as client requirements increasingly diverge with respect to investment criteria, and as economic and sustainability contexts shift.\n\n \n\nIn this module you are introduced to the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) approach to real estate valuation, an approach increasingly important for members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and offering transparency for clients and sensitivity and scenario analysis in the light of future uncertainties. Each week you will participate in interactive lectures where principles are introduced and explained through the use of client-focused scenarios, and you will have the opportunity to develop your knowledge and skills in DCF, supported by weekly tutorials. This module is based on developing DCF spreadsheets using excel, enabling you to develop employability skills in the areas of digital numeracy and commercial awareness. This approach explicitly places valuation within economic and political contexts, allowing scenarios to be explored as these wider contexts shift. You will be able to learn how to respond to different scenarios and client requirements. For example, you will see how DCF can be effectively used to assess the viability of improving the sustainability of real estate and how to respond and provide strategic advice to clients in the light of the challenges this brings. You will be guided through how to provide advice to clients considering purchasing real estate and how opportunities can be evaluated against target rates of return. Using feedback provided during 'Applied Real Estate Valuation' in the first semester, in this second semester module you will be able to deepen your skills in preparing and presenting a client-focused professional valuation report.\n\n \n\nThe aims of the module are to:\n\n1.       Enable you to develop skills in developing and using DCF valuation techniques in response to client requirements.\n\n2.       Reflect on the basic valuation inputs and extend the analysis to better reflect asset characteristics and economic contexts.\n\n3.       Allow you to deepen your skills in carrying out and presenting valuation work with regard to the highest professional and ethical standards.\n15 credits\n\n\nProperty Law\n\n\nManaging real estate assets is fundamental to their successful operation and ongoing viability. It is therefore core to the success of places and resilience in the built environment. Yet the complexities and legal systems involved in this management is little understood by many professionals involved in safeguarding the future of places. The liabilities of real estate owners and occupiers underpin the investment performance of real estate assets and in this module you will be introduced to this fascinating area.\n\n \n\nYou will be able to learn about a range of important areas for real estate professionals, such as the property law issues that can prevent or restrict new developments, and the legal responsibilities for asset managers, and how these issues can impact on property values. You will get to study and understand how to avoid acting with professional negligence in your career, and how to recognise and appreciate legal rights and obligations, including of buyers, sellers, landlords and tenants. Lectures are used to set out different issues and will use examples and case law to illustrate problems that can occur and how to recognise and avoid these. You will be able to develop and deepen your understanding through supported tutorials, where you will be able to ask questions and practise responding to client-focused scenarios.\n\n \n\nThe aims of the module are to:\n\n1.       Illustrate the importance and complexities of property law in asset and place management.\n\n2.       Explain and use examples to show how statute and case law underpin legal obligations of real estate professionals.\n\n3.       Consider how property law relates to the broader legal and fiscal background and prevailing market conditions, and how this impacts on real estate.\n15 credits\n\n\nReal Estate Planning and Development Project\n\n\nReal estate development involves several interconnected factors such as land acquisition, design and planning consent, construction and marketing / disposal. It requires developers to make informed decisions based on multiple appraisals of market, planning, financial and risk factors. Planning in particular plays a crucial role in shaping real estate development projects. It provides a framework for decision making, can promote sustainable development and ensure development projects contribute positively to the built environment. At the same time, planning can also impose constraints that can limit the scope and nature of projects. Studying the real estate development process will enhance your ability to analyse complex problems, develop effective solutions, and learn valuable decision-making skills.  \n\nThe module builds upon the principles of land and development introduced in the Autumn semester. It focuses on the interrelationship between real estate development and spatial planning and explores the main aspects of development appraisal.  You will work towards producing an assessment of the planning potential and viability considerations for a real-world development site in an integrated way that fully accounts for the relevant institutional and legal frameworks. The module therefore includes coverage of: market research, planning appraisal, financial appraisal (including financial appraisal using residual and cash-flow methods), sustainability considerations, sources and methods of development finance, sources and management of risk and uncertainty; and the influence of the planning system on real estate development and investment.\n\nThe aims of the module are to:\n\n- Enable you to assess development potential and understand the various influences upon it, including planning policy and design considerations\n\n- Allow you to develop a solution that offers the greatest likelihood of a successful outcome \n\n- Develop your appreciation of the theoretical and practical justification of the solution\n\n- Allow you to deepen your skills in project management, development appraisal, financial analysis and the clear presentation of complex information in professional business report form\n15 credits\n\n\nInnovation and Digital Transformation\n\n\nThe real estate profession is changing and in recent decades, real estate use, operations and service have evolved significantly as a result of demographic and socio-cultural changes and the advancement of digital technology. This module will introduce you to a wide range of innovative systems, digital tools and platforms that underpin contemporary real estate use and services. You will also be able to develop soft employability skills such as creativity, entrepreneurship, teamworking, collaboration and problem-solving. \n\nThe module allows you to understand the links between various segments of the real estate value chain and to appreciate the environmental, social, economic and physical (ESEP) inefficiencies and challenges within the sector. You will be introduced to a wide range of advanced digital tools such as Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, blockchain, virtual reality and drones and you will be able to learn about how these tools are creating a new ecosystem of digital technology within the real estate sector (commonly referred to as PropTech). You will also be challenged to critically reflect on existing innovative systems and digital tools within the real estate sector and to identify opportunities for more effective and efficient systems and approaches. The module will also introduce you to emerging concepts such as the sharing economy and operational real estate which have developed in the last couple of decades. Your learning will be supported by case study analysis, group discussions, workshops and guest presentations from industry experts.\n\nLearning will be delivered through a combination of problem-oriented, collaborative and project-based learning approaches which will enable you to develop skills such as creativity, communication, strategic thinking, entrepreneurship, teamwork and problem solving.  \n\nThe aims of the module are to: \n\nIntroduce you to the full spectrum of the real estate value chain and the links between them; \n\nExplore the emerging areas of real estate practice and their roles and functions in real estate markets;\n\nExplore the various environmental, social, economic and physical inefficiencies and challenges within the built environment sector and demonstrate the role of innovation and digital technology in addressing them;\n\nSupport you to develop problem-solving, innovative, and creative skills that can enable various dimensions of solutions to a wide range of challenges in the built environment industry.\n15 credits\nCore modules:\nThis module builds on the principles of valuation introduced in the Autumn Semester.

Land provides the foundation, while planning outlines the vision. Development brings the vision to life, and professional ethical standards ensure stakeholders have the necessary knowledge and skills to perform their duties effectively, professionally and ethically, in accordance with the professional rules of conduct and regulations. A strong grasp of these interconnected elements will empower you to make informed decisions, mitigate risks, and create sustainable, thriving communities. By aligning development goals with ethical principles, you will develop an appreciation of how development can have a positive and lasting impact.\n\nThe module aims to:\n\n- Introduce you to the core knowledge and characteristics of land and development markets, with a particular focus on sustainability \n\n- Allow you to understand development appraisal techniques and how planning, design and risk influence developer profit and development feasibility\n\n- Enable you to the understand the importance of professional rules of conduct and the complexities of dealing with difficult situations in an ethically appropriate and defensible manner\n15 credits\n\n\nApplied Real Estate Valuation\n\n\nValuation is at the core of the real estate industry. It underpins work across multiple specialisms, such as buying and selling real estate assets; managing investment portfolios; developing new real estate; regenerating areas to enhance resilience and improve the local economy and sense of place; and ensuring sustainability in the built environment.  \n\n \n\nIn this module you will be able to learn about the basic building blocks of valuation, the financial maths tools that will stay with you throughout your studies and career. These are presented to you using client-focused scenarios, with many opportunities to practise and gain familiarity through both supported problem-solving tutorials and a bespoke online tool with built-in help and guidance. The module then moves onto the next stage and you will see how you can use these valuation tools to undertake more complex and applied professional work. This stage focuses on the five methods of valuation (comparable, investment, profits, residual and contractors) that you will need throughout your career and that will give you the flexibility to specialise as your interests develop. Throughout this stage, interactive lectures will be used to explain worked examples with further scenarios for you to tackle to begin to develop and apply your knowledge and skills, as well as through weekly tutorials.\n\n \n\nDuring the module, you will get to use industry data to prepare your own valuations, and you will be taken through guidance set out by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors on working to the highest professional, ethical and sustainability standards.  \n\n \n\nThe aims of the module are to:\n\n1.       Explain and apply the basic financial maths valuation tools to simple client-focused scenarios;\n\n2.       Introduce and illustrate the five methods of valuation used across real estate core and specialist areas of work;\n\n3.       Explore and demonstrate the importance of robust data collection, analysis and presentation within professionally-defensible valuations; and\n\n4.       Guide you through the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors' standards to ensure work can be undertaken to meet the highest client-facing professional, ethical and sustainability standards.\n15 credits\n\n\nReal Estate Economics\n\n\nExploring and gaining understanding of the economics of real estate at the start of your studies will provide you with the foundations of knowledge needed across core and specialist areas such as valuation, development and investment. This module allows you to develop a deep understanding of the real estate market and you will be able to learn about how the market works, what influences it, and how it operates. The module also helps you to develop skills in analysing real estate data. \n\nThis module presents a comprehensive exploration of real estate economics, starting with the fundamentals and moving towards more advanced analysis. It begins with foundational knowledge on the structure of real estate markets, micro and macroeconomic influences, and core real estate sectors, including sustainable practice. You will be challenged to think about and apply this knowledge with a global perspective, by participating in workshops focusing on international real estate activities and practices. You will hear from industry experts on topics such as globally important markets, emerging issues, and case studies of market change. The latter part of the module equips you with analytical skills, featuring workshops on commercial and housing market analysis. Throughout the module, you'll be able to engage in practical exercises to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios, preparing you for dynamic roles in the real estate industry.\n\nThe aims of the module are to:\n\n1. Explore the structure and operation of real estate markets, including the linkages between real estate and wider economy.\n\n2. Examine the impact of globalisation on real estate, including international market dynamics and practice.\n\n3. Provide an understanding of real estate market analysis.\n15 credits\n\n\nReal Estate Investment\n\n\nReal estate presents developers, investors and asset managers with both unique opportunities and risks. In this module you will be able to learn about the characteristics of real estate, the opportunities it provides for investors, and how it compares to other investment classes. You will be guided through the theories that can be used to inform investment decisions when building and managing a portfolio of real estate assets. You will get to use real estate data for UK and international global real estate markets to explore how these investment theories can be used in practice, and you will be able to develop and practise new skills to analyse a simulated international portfolio management task. Core principles and ideas are set out in lectures, and supported workshops will help you to develop skills in data analysis and understand how your growing professional specialist knowledge can inform your decision-making and analysis.\n\n The module will also explore important and contemporary topics in real estate investment, and you will be challenged to think about areas such as how sustainability is shifting the investment landscape, and how behaviours can affect decision-making and investment outcomes. The module will allow you to develop skills in combining your real estate investment knowledge and analytical skills in a professional report responding to a client-based portfolio management task.\n\n \n\nThe aims of the module are to:\n\n1.       Introduce and explore the characteristics of real estate and the opportunities and risks this provides.\n\n2.       Examine how investment theories can guide decision-making.\n\n3.       Enable development of digital numeracy skills and the application of these to data analysis and portfolio management scenarios.\n\n4.       Encourage skills in professional report writing and provision of evidenced recommendations for portfolio management.\n15 credits\n\n\nEmployability and Professional Skills\n\n\nAs professional skills become increasingly vital for workplace success, this module will allow you to develop a range of supporting skills that will enhance your learning experience at Sheffield and prepare you for a successful career. \n\nThe module has two elements: 1. Cultures of Learning and Professional Skills - understanding how we teach at Sheffield, how to get the most out of your study and how to develop key generic professional/soft skills 2. Employability Skills - preparing you for careers within planning, design, real estate, GIS and related professional areas.\n\n\n\nThe aims of this  module are: \n\n1. to provide a range of supporting skills for home and international students, which will help you get the most out of your learning in Sheffield\n\n2. to prepare you for professional employment and career development at the end of your studies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second semester focuses on the development, application and integration of knowledge and skills.\n\n\n\n Core modules:\n\n\nInvestment Valuation\n\n\nThis module builds on the principles of valuation introduced in the Autumn Semester. It focuses on the valuation of office, retail and industrial real estate, together comprising the most common type of commercial real estate, dominating the landscape of the built environment. The investment method of valuation, introduced in 'Applied Real Estate Valuation', is revisited and the basic principles are extended to allow a more advanced analysis of value. This is important as client requirements increasingly diverge with respect to investment criteria, and as economic and sustainability contexts shift.\n\n \n\nIn this module you are introduced to the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) approach to real estate valuation, an approach increasingly important for members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and offering transparency for clients and sensitivity and scenario analysis in the light of future uncertainties. Each week you will participate in interactive lectures where principles are introduced and explained through the use of client-focused scenarios, and you will have the opportunity to develop your knowledge and skills in DCF, supported by weekly tutorials. This module is based on developing DCF spreadsheets using excel, enabling you to develop employability skills in the areas of digital numeracy and commercial awareness. This approach explicitly places valuation within economic and political contexts, allowing scenarios to be explored as these wider contexts shift. You will be able to learn how to respond to different scenarios and client requirements. For example, you will see how DCF can be effectively used to assess the viability of improving the sustainability of real estate and how to respond and provide strategic advice to clients in the light of the challenges this brings. You will be guided through how to provide advice to clients considering purchasing real estate and how opportunities can be evaluated against target rates of return. Using feedback provided during 'Applied Real Estate Valuation' in the first semester, in this second semester module you will be able to deepen your skills in preparing and presenting a client-focused professional valuation report.\n\n \n\nThe aims of the module are to:\n\n1.       Enable you to develop skills in developing and using DCF valuation techniques in response to client requirements.\n\n2.       Reflect on the basic valuation inputs and extend the analysis to better reflect asset characteristics and economic contexts.\n\n3.       Allow you to deepen your skills in carrying out and presenting valuation work with regard to the highest professional and ethical standards.\n15 credits\n\n\nProperty Law\n\n\nManaging real estate assets is fundamental to their successful operation and ongoing viability. It is therefore core to the success of places and resilience in the built environment. Yet the complexities and legal systems involved in this management is little understood by many professionals involved in safeguarding the future of places. The liabilities of real estate owners and occupiers underpin the investment performance of real estate assets and in this module you will be introduced to this fascinating area.\n\n \n\nYou will be able to learn about a range of important areas for real estate professionals, such as the property law issues that can prevent or restrict new developments, and the legal responsibilities for asset managers, and how these issues can impact on property values. You will get to study and understand how to avoid acting with professional negligence in your career, and how to recognise and appreciate legal rights and obligations, including of buyers, sellers, landlords and tenants. Lectures are used to set out different issues and will use examples and case law to illustrate problems that can occur and how to recognise and avoid these. You will be able to develop and deepen your understanding through supported tutorials, where you will be able to ask questions and practise responding to client-focused scenarios.\n\n \n\nThe aims of the module are to:\n\n1.       Illustrate the importance and complexities of property law in asset and place management.\n\n2.       Explain and use examples to show how statute and case law underpin legal obligations of real estate professionals.\n\n3.       Consider how property law relates to the broader legal and fiscal background and prevailing market conditions, and how this impacts on real estate.\n15 credits\n\n\nReal Estate Planning and Development Project\n\n\nReal estate development involves several interconnected factors such as land acquisition, design and planning consent, construction and marketing / disposal. It requires developers to make informed decisions based on multiple appraisals of market, planning, financial and risk factors. Planning in particular plays a crucial role in shaping real estate development projects. It provides a framework for decision making, can promote sustainable development and ensure development projects contribute positively to the built environment. At the same time, planning can also impose constraints that can limit the scope and nature of projects. Studying the real estate development process will enhance your ability to analyse complex problems, develop effective solutions, and learn valuable decision-making skills.  \n\nThe module builds upon the principles of land and development introduced in the Autumn semester. It focuses on the interrelationship between real estate development and spatial planning and explores the main aspects of development appraisal.  You will work towards producing an assessment of the planning potential and viability considerations for a real-world development site in an integrated way that fully accounts for the relevant institutional and legal frameworks. The module therefore includes coverage of: market research, planning appraisal, financial appraisal (including financial appraisal using residual and cash-flow methods), sustainability considerations, sources and methods of development finance, sources and management of risk and uncertainty; and the influence of the planning system on real estate development and investment.\n\nThe aims of the module are to:\n\n- Enable you to assess development potential and understand the various influences upon it, including planning policy and design considerations\n\n- Allow you to develop a solution that offers the greatest likelihood of a successful outcome \n\n- Develop your appreciation of the theoretical and practical justification of the solution\n\n- Allow you to deepen your skills in project management, development appraisal, financial analysis and the clear presentation of complex information in professional business report form\n15 credits\n\n\nInnovation and Digital Transformation\n\n\nThe real estate profession is changing and in recent decades, real estate use, operations and service have evolved significantly as a result of demographic and socio-cultural changes and the advancement of digital technology. This module will introduce you to a wide range of innovative systems, digital tools and platforms that underpin contemporary real estate use and services. You will also be able to develop soft employability skills such as creativity, entrepreneurship, teamworking, collaboration and problem-solving. \n\nThe module allows you to understand the links between various segments of the real estate value chain and to appreciate the environmental, social, economic and physical (ESEP) inefficiencies and challenges within the sector. You will be introduced to a wide range of advanced digital tools such as Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, blockchain, virtual reality and drones and you will be able to learn about how these tools are creating a new ecosystem of digital technology within the real estate sector (commonly referred to as PropTech). You will also be challenged to critically reflect on existing innovative systems and digital tools within the real estate sector and to identify opportunities for more effective and efficient systems and approaches. The module will also introduce you to emerging concepts such as the sharing economy and operational real estate which have developed in the last couple of decades. Your learning will be supported by case study analysis, group discussions, workshops and guest presentations from industry experts.\n\nLearning will be delivered through a combination of problem-oriented, collaborative and project-based learning approaches which will enable you to develop skills such as creativity, communication, strategic thinking, entrepreneurship, teamwork and problem solving.  \n\nThe aims of the module are to: \n\nIntroduce you to the full spectrum of the real estate value chain and the links between them; \n\nExplore the emerging areas of real estate practice and their roles and functions in real estate markets;\n\nExplore the various environmental, social, economic and physical inefficiencies and challenges within the built environment sector and demonstrate the role of innovation and digital technology in addressing them;\n\nSupport you to develop problem-solving, innovative, and creative skills that can enable various dimensions of solutions to a wide range of challenges in the built environment industry.\n15 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will complete your dissertation over the summer.\n\n\n\n Core module:\n\n\nReal Estate Research Project\n\n\nThis core module is a major research project that offers you the opportunity to develop and manage an individual empirical research project of specialist surveying concern. During the module, you will get the opportunity to develop and apply research skills and develop an appreciation of the issues involved in managing a real estate research project, which may include sourcing and analysing property data in a research context. You will have the opportunity to gain experience in the key stages of undertaking a research project, including identifying a topic; conducting a review of existing knowledge; identifying research questions; selecting methods; designing and conducting a project of specialist surveying concern; and presenting the outcome of the project in a logical and coherent written format. In taking this module, you will be able to deepen your knowledge and experience of conducting research in an area of specialist surveying concern. \n\nThe module aims to give you the opportunity to experience conducting an original research project with supervisory guidance. More specifically, it aims to:\n\n- Enable you to develop skills in topic selection and refinement; research design skills and project management;\n\n- Let you develop an understanding of the role of research in relation to theoretical and practical dimensions of the surveying discipline;\n\n- Allow you to further and deepen knowledge in a chosen field of specialist surveying concern;\n\n- Offer you the opportunity to build on knowledge of specific research methods and analytical techniques and develop skills in independent research.\n60 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content of our courses is reviewed annually to make sure it's up-to-date and relevant.

Land provides the foundation, while planning outlines the vision. Development brings the vision to life, and professional ethical standards ensure stakeholders have the necessary knowledge and skills to perform their duties effectively, professionally and ethically, in accordance with the professional rules of conduct and regulations. A strong grasp of these interconnected elements will empower you to make informed decisions, mitigate risks, and create sustainable, thriving communities. By aligning development goals with ethical principles, you will develop an appreciation of how development can have a positive and lasting impact.\n\nThe module aims to:\n\n- Introduce you to the core knowledge and characteristics of land and development markets, with a particular focus on sustainability \n\n- Allow you to understand development appraisal techniques and how planning, design and risk influence developer profit and development feasibility\n\n- Enable you to the understand the importance of professional rules of conduct and the complexities of dealing with difficult situations in an ethically appropriate and defensible manner\n15 credits\n\n\nApplied Real Estate Valuation\n\n\nValuation is at the core of the real estate industry. It underpins work across multiple specialisms, such as buying and selling real estate assets; managing investment portfolios; developing new real estate; regenerating areas to enhance resilience and improve the local economy and sense of place; and ensuring sustainability in the built environment.  \n\n \n\nIn this module you will be able to learn about the basic building blocks of valuation, the financial maths tools that will stay with you throughout your studies and career. These are presented to you using client-focused scenarios, with many opportunities to practise and gain familiarity through both supported problem-solving tutorials and a bespoke online tool with built-in help and guidance. The module then moves onto the next stage and you will see how you can use these valuation tools to undertake more complex and applied professional work. This stage focuses on the five methods of valuation (comparable, investment, profits, residual and contractors) that you will need throughout your career and that will give you the flexibility to specialise as your interests develop. Throughout this stage, interactive lectures will be used to explain worked examples with further scenarios for you to tackle to begin to develop and apply your knowledge and skills, as well as through weekly tutorials.\n\n \n\nDuring the module, you will get to use industry data to prepare your own valuations, and you will be taken through guidance set out by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors on working to the highest professional, ethical and sustainability standards.  \n\n \n\nThe aims of the module are to:\n\n1.       Explain and apply the basic financial maths valuation tools to simple client-focused scenarios;\n\n2.       Introduce and illustrate the five methods of valuation used across real estate core and specialist areas of work;\n\n3.       Explore and demonstrate the importance of robust data collection, analysis and presentation within professionally-defensible valuations; and\n\n4.       Guide you through the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors' standards to ensure work can be undertaken to meet the highest client-facing professional, ethical and sustainability standards.\n15 credits\n\n\nReal Estate Economics\n\n\nExploring and gaining understanding of the economics of real estate at the start of your studies will provide you with the foundations of knowledge needed across core and specialist areas such as valuation, development and investment. This module allows you to develop a deep understanding of the real estate market and you will be able to learn about how the market works, what influences it, and how it operates. The module also helps you to develop skills in analysing real estate data. \n\nThis module presents a comprehensive exploration of real estate economics, starting with the fundamentals and moving towards more advanced analysis. It begins with foundational knowledge on the structure of real estate markets, micro and macroeconomic influences, and core real estate sectors, including sustainable practice. You will be challenged to think about and apply this knowledge with a global perspective, by participating in workshops focusing on international real estate activities and practices. You will hear from industry experts on topics such as globally important markets, emerging issues, and case studies of market change. The latter part of the module equips you with analytical skills, featuring workshops on commercial and housing market analysis. Throughout the module, you'll be able to engage in practical exercises to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios, preparing you for dynamic roles in the real estate industry.\n\nThe aims of the module are to:\n\n1. Explore the structure and operation of real estate markets, including the linkages between real estate and wider economy.\n\n2. Examine the impact of globalisation on real estate, including international market dynamics and practice.\n\n3. Provide an understanding of real estate market analysis.\n15 credits\n\n\nReal Estate Investment\n\n\nReal estate presents developers, investors and asset managers with both unique opportunities and risks. In this module you will be able to learn about the characteristics of real estate, the opportunities it provides for investors, and how it compares to other investment classes. You will be guided through the theories that can be used to inform investment decisions when building and managing a portfolio of real estate assets. You will get to use real estate data for UK and international global real estate markets to explore how these investment theories can be used in practice, and you will be able to develop and practise new skills to analyse a simulated international portfolio management task. Core principles and ideas are set out in lectures, and supported workshops will help you to develop skills in data analysis and understand how your growing professional specialist knowledge can inform your decision-making and analysis.\n\n The module will also explore important and contemporary topics in real estate investment, and you will be challenged to think about areas such as how sustainability is shifting the investment landscape, and how behaviours can affect decision-making and investment outcomes. The module will allow you to develop skills in combining your real estate investment knowledge and analytical skills in a professional report responding to a client-based portfolio management task.\n\n \n\nThe aims of the module are to:\n\n1.       Introduce and explore the characteristics of real estate and the opportunities and risks this provides.\n\n2.       Examine how investment theories can guide decision-making.\n\n3.       Enable development of digital numeracy skills and the application of these to data analysis and portfolio management scenarios.\n\n4.       Encourage skills in professional report writing and provision of evidenced recommendations for portfolio management.\n15 credits\n\n\nEmployability and Professional Skills\n\n\nAs professional skills become increasingly vital for workplace success, this module will allow you to develop a range of supporting skills that will enhance your learning experience at Sheffield and prepare you for a successful career. \n\nThe module has two elements: 1. Cultures of Learning and Professional Skills - understanding how we teach at Sheffield, how to get the most out of your study and how to develop key generic professional/soft skills 2. Employability Skills - preparing you for careers within planning, design, real estate, GIS and related professional areas.\n\n\n\nThe aims of this  module are: \n\n1. to provide a range of supporting skills for home and international students, which will help you get the most out of your learning in Sheffield\n\n2. to prepare you for professional employment and career development at the end of your studies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second semester focuses on the development, application and integration of knowledge and skills.\n\n\n\n Core modules:\n\n\nInvestment Valuation\n\n\nThis module builds on the principles of valuation introduced in the Autumn Semester. It focuses on the valuation of office, retail and industrial real estate, together comprising the most common type of commercial real estate, dominating the landscape of the built environment. The investment method of valuation, introduced in 'Applied Real Estate Valuation', is revisited and the basic principles are extended to allow a more advanced analysis of value. This is important as client requirements increasingly diverge with respect to investment criteria, and as economic and sustainability contexts shift.\n\n \n\nIn this module you are introduced to the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) approach to real estate valuation, an approach increasingly important for members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and offering transparency for clients and sensitivity and scenario analysis in the light of future uncertainties. Each week you will participate in interactive lectures where principles are introduced and explained through the use of client-focused scenarios, and you will have the opportunity to develop your knowledge and skills in DCF, supported by weekly tutorials. This module is based on developing DCF spreadsheets using excel, enabling you to develop employability skills in the areas of digital numeracy and commercial awareness. This approach explicitly places valuation within economic and political contexts, allowing scenarios to be explored as these wider contexts shift. You will be able to learn how to respond to different scenarios and client requirements. For example, you will see how DCF can be effectively used to assess the viability of improving the sustainability of real estate and how to respond and provide strategic advice to clients in the light of the challenges this brings. You will be guided through how to provide advice to clients considering purchasing real estate and how opportunities can be evaluated against target rates of return. Using feedback provided during 'Applied Real Estate Valuation' in the first semester, in this second semester module you will be able to deepen your skills in preparing and presenting a client-focused professional valuation report.\n\n \n\nThe aims of the module are to:\n\n1.       Enable you to develop skills in developing and using DCF valuation techniques in response to client requirements.\n\n2.       Reflect on the basic valuation inputs and extend the analysis to better reflect asset characteristics and economic contexts.\n\n3.       Allow you to deepen your skills in carrying out and presenting valuation work with regard to the highest professional and ethical standards.\n15 credits\n\n\nProperty Law\n\n\nManaging real estate assets is fundamental to their successful operation and ongoing viability. It is therefore core to the success of places and resilience in the built environment. Yet the complexities and legal systems involved in this management is little understood by many professionals involved in safeguarding the future of places. The liabilities of real estate owners and occupiers underpin the investment performance of real estate assets and in this module you will be introduced to this fascinating area.\n\n \n\nYou will be able to learn about a range of important areas for real estate professionals, such as the property law issues that can prevent or restrict new developments, and the legal responsibilities for asset managers, and how these issues can impact on property values. You will get to study and understand how to avoid acting with professional negligence in your career, and how to recognise and appreciate legal rights and obligations, including of buyers, sellers, landlords and tenants. Lectures are used to set out different issues and will use examples and case law to illustrate problems that can occur and how to recognise and avoid these. You will be able to develop and deepen your understanding through supported tutorials, where you will be able to ask questions and practise responding to client-focused scenarios.\n\n \n\nThe aims of the module are to:\n\n1.       Illustrate the importance and complexities of property law in asset and place management.\n\n2.       Explain and use examples to show how statute and case law underpin legal obligations of real estate professionals.\n\n3.       Consider how property law relates to the broader legal and fiscal background and prevailing market conditions, and how this impacts on real estate.\n15 credits\n\n\nReal Estate Planning and Development Project\n\n\nReal estate development involves several interconnected factors such as land acquisition, design and planning consent, construction and marketing / disposal. It requires developers to make informed decisions based on multiple appraisals of market, planning, financial and risk factors. Planning in particular plays a crucial role in shaping real estate development projects. It provides a framework for decision making, can promote sustainable development and ensure development projects contribute positively to the built environment. At the same time, planning can also impose constraints that can limit the scope and nature of projects. Studying the real estate development process will enhance your ability to analyse complex problems, develop effective solutions, and learn valuable decision-making skills.  \n\nThe module builds upon the principles of land and development introduced in the Autumn semester. It focuses on the interrelationship between real estate development and spatial planning and explores the main aspects of development appraisal.  You will work towards producing an assessment of the planning potential and viability considerations for a real-world development site in an integrated way that fully accounts for the relevant institutional and legal frameworks. The module therefore includes coverage of: market research, planning appraisal, financial appraisal (including financial appraisal using residual and cash-flow methods), sustainability considerations, sources and methods of development finance, sources and management of risk and uncertainty; and the influence of the planning system on real estate development and investment.\n\nThe aims of the module are to:\n\n- Enable you to assess development potential and understand the various influences upon it, including planning policy and design considerations\n\n- Allow you to develop a solution that offers the greatest likelihood of a successful outcome \n\n- Develop your appreciation of the theoretical and practical justification of the solution\n\n- Allow you to deepen your skills in project management, development appraisal, financial analysis and the clear presentation of complex information in professional business report form\n15 credits\n\n\nInnovation and Digital Transformation\n\n\nThe real estate profession is changing and in recent decades, real estate use, operations and service have evolved significantly as a result of demographic and socio-cultural changes and the advancement of digital technology. This module will introduce you to a wide range of innovative systems, digital tools and platforms that underpin contemporary real estate use and services. You will also be able to develop soft employability skills such as creativity, entrepreneurship, teamworking, collaboration and problem-solving. \n\nThe module allows you to understand the links between various segments of the real estate value chain and to appreciate the environmental, social, economic and physical (ESEP) inefficiencies and challenges within the sector. You will be introduced to a wide range of advanced digital tools such as Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, blockchain, virtual reality and drones and you will be able to learn about how these tools are creating a new ecosystem of digital technology within the real estate sector (commonly referred to as PropTech). You will also be challenged to critically reflect on existing innovative systems and digital tools within the real estate sector and to identify opportunities for more effective and efficient systems and approaches. The module will also introduce you to emerging concepts such as the sharing economy and operational real estate which have developed in the last couple of decades. Your learning will be supported by case study analysis, group discussions, workshops and guest presentations from industry experts.\n\nLearning will be delivered through a combination of problem-oriented, collaborative and project-based learning approaches which will enable you to develop skills such as creativity, communication, strategic thinking, entrepreneurship, teamwork and problem solving.  \n\nThe aims of the module are to: \n\nIntroduce you to the full spectrum of the real estate value chain and the links between them; \n\nExplore the emerging areas of real estate practice and their roles and functions in real estate markets;\n\nExplore the various environmental, social, economic and physical inefficiencies and challenges within the built environment sector and demonstrate the role of innovation and digital technology in addressing them;\n\nSupport you to develop problem-solving, innovative, and creative skills that can enable various dimensions of solutions to a wide range of challenges in the built environment industry.\n15 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will complete your dissertation over the summer.\n\n\n\n Core module:\n\n\nReal Estate Research Project\n\n\nThis core module is a major research project that offers you the opportunity to develop and manage an individual empirical research project of specialist surveying concern. During the module, you will get the opportunity to develop and apply research skills and develop an appreciation of the issues involved in managing a real estate research project, which may include sourcing and analysing property data in a research context. You will have the opportunity to gain experience in the key stages of undertaking a research project, including identifying a topic; conducting a review of existing knowledge; identifying research questions; selecting methods; designing and conducting a project of specialist surveying concern; and presenting the outcome of the project in a logical and coherent written format. In taking this module, you will be able to deepen your knowledge and experience of conducting research in an area of specialist surveying concern. \n\nThe module aims to give you the opportunity to experience conducting an original research project with supervisory guidance. More specifically, it aims to:\n\n- Enable you to develop skills in topic selection and refinement; research design skills and project management;\n\n- Let you develop an understanding of the role of research in relation to theoretical and practical dimensions of the surveying discipline;\n\n- Allow you to further and deepen knowledge in a chosen field of specialist surveying concern;\n\n- Offer you the opportunity to build on knowledge of specific research methods and analytical techniques and develop skills in independent research.\n60 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content of our courses is reviewed annually to make sure it's up-to-date and relevant.

Throughout this stage, interactive lectures will be used to explain worked examples with further scenarios for you to tackle to begin to develop and apply your knowledge and skills, as well as through weekly tutorials.\n\n \n\nDuring the module, you will get to use industry data to prepare your own valuations, and you will be taken through guidance set out by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors on working to the highest professional, ethical and sustainability standards.  \n\n \n\nThe aims of the module are to:\n\n1.       Explain and apply the basic financial maths valuation tools to simple client-focused scenarios;\n\n2.       Introduce and illustrate the five methods of valuation used across real estate core and specialist areas of work;\n\n3.       Explore and demonstrate the importance of robust data collection, analysis and presentation within professionally-defensible valuations; and\n\n4.       Guide you through the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors' standards to ensure work can be undertaken to meet the highest client-facing professional, ethical and sustainability standards.\n15 credits\n\n\nReal Estate Economics\n\n\nExploring and gaining understanding of the economics of real estate at the start of your studies will provide you with the foundations of knowledge needed across core and specialist areas such as valuation, development and investment. This module allows you to develop a deep understanding of the real estate market and you will be able to learn about how the market works, what influences it, and how it operates. The module also helps you to develop skills in analysing real estate data. \n\nThis module presents a comprehensive exploration of real estate economics, starting with the fundamentals and moving towards more advanced analysis. It begins with foundational knowledge on the structure of real estate markets, micro and macroeconomic influences, and core real estate sectors, including sustainable practice. You will be challenged to think about and apply this knowledge with a global perspective, by participating in workshops focusing on international real estate activities and practices. You will hear from industry experts on topics such as globally important markets, emerging issues, and case studies of market change. The latter part of the module equips you with analytical skills, featuring workshops on commercial and housing market analysis. Throughout the module, you'll be able to engage in practical exercises to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios, preparing you for dynamic roles in the real estate industry.\n\nThe aims of the module are to:\n\n1.

Provide an understanding of real estate market analysis.\n15 credits\n\n\nReal Estate Investment\n\n\nReal estate presents developers, investors and asset managers with both unique opportunities and risks. In this module you will be able to learn about the characteristics of real estate, the opportunities it provides for investors, and how it compares to other investment classes. You will be guided through the theories that can be used to inform investment decisions when building and managing a portfolio of real estate assets. You will get to use real estate data for UK and international global real estate markets to explore how these investment theories can be used in practice, and you will be able to develop and practise new skills to analyse a simulated international portfolio management task. Core principles and ideas are set out in lectures, and supported workshops will help you to develop skills in data analysis and understand how your growing professional specialist knowledge can inform your decision-making and analysis.\n\n The module will also explore important and contemporary topics in real estate investment, and you will be challenged to think about areas such as how sustainability is shifting the investment landscape, and how behaviours can affect decision-making and investment outcomes. The module will allow you to develop skills in combining your real estate investment knowledge and analytical skills in a professional report responding to a client-based portfolio management task.\n\n \n\nThe aims of the module are to:\n\n1.       Introduce and explore the characteristics of real estate and the opportunities and risks this provides.\n\n2.       Examine how investment theories can guide decision-making.\n\n3.       Enable development of digital numeracy skills and the application of these to data analysis and portfolio management scenarios.\n\n4.       Encourage skills in professional report writing and provision of evidenced recommendations for portfolio management.\n15 credits\n\n\nEmployability and Professional Skills\n\n\nAs professional skills become increasingly vital for workplace success, this module will allow you to develop a range of supporting skills that will enhance your learning experience at Sheffield and prepare you for a successful career. \n\nThe module has two elements: 1. Cultures of Learning and Professional Skills - understanding how we teach at Sheffield, how to get the most out of your study and how to develop key generic professional/soft skills 2. Employability Skills - preparing you for careers within planning, design, real estate, GIS and related professional areas.\n\n\n\nThe aims of this  module are: \n\n1. to provide a range of supporting skills for home and international students, which will help you get the most out of your learning in Sheffield\n\n2. to prepare you for professional employment and career development at the end of your studies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second semester focuses on the development, application and integration of knowledge and skills.\n\n\n\n Core modules:\n\n\nInvestment Valuation\n\n\nThis module builds on the principles of valuation introduced in the Autumn Semester. It focuses on the valuation of office, retail and industrial real estate, together comprising the most common type of commercial real estate, dominating the landscape of the built environment. The investment method of valuation, introduced in 'Applied Real Estate Valuation', is revisited and the basic principles are extended to allow a more advanced analysis of value. This is important as client requirements increasingly diverge with respect to investment criteria, and as economic and sustainability contexts shift.\n\n \n\nIn this module you are introduced to the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) approach to real estate valuation, an approach increasingly important for members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and offering transparency for clients and sensitivity and scenario analysis in the light of future uncertainties. Each week you will participate in interactive lectures where principles are introduced and explained through the use of client-focused scenarios, and you will have the opportunity to develop your knowledge and skills in DCF, supported by weekly tutorials. This module is based on developing DCF spreadsheets using excel, enabling you to develop employability skills in the areas of digital numeracy and commercial awareness. This approach explicitly places valuation within economic and political contexts, allowing scenarios to be explored as these wider contexts shift. You will be able to learn how to respond to different scenarios and client requirements. For example, you will see how DCF can be effectively used to assess the viability of improving the sustainability of real estate and how to respond and provide strategic advice to clients in the light of the challenges this brings. You will be guided through how to provide advice to clients considering purchasing real estate and how opportunities can be evaluated against target rates of return. Using feedback provided during 'Applied Real Estate Valuation' in the first semester, in this second semester module you will be able to deepen your skills in preparing and presenting a client-focused professional valuation report.\n\n \n\nThe aims of the module are to:\n\n1.       Enable you to develop skills in developing and using DCF valuation techniques in response to client requirements.\n\n2.       Reflect on the basic valuation inputs and extend the analysis to better reflect asset characteristics and economic contexts.\n\n3.       Allow you to deepen your skills in carrying out and presenting valuation work with regard to the highest professional and ethical standards.\n15 credits\n\n\nProperty Law\n\n\nManaging real estate assets is fundamental to their successful operation and ongoing viability. It is therefore core to the success of places and resilience in the built environment. Yet the complexities and legal systems involved in this management is little understood by many professionals involved in safeguarding the future of places. The liabilities of real estate owners and occupiers underpin the investment performance of real estate assets and in this module you will be introduced to this fascinating area.\n\n \n\nYou will be able to learn about a range of important areas for real estate professionals, such as the property law issues that can prevent or restrict new developments, and the legal responsibilities for asset managers, and how these issues can impact on property values. You will get to study and understand how to avoid acting with professional negligence in your career, and how to recognise and appreciate legal rights and obligations, including of buyers, sellers, landlords and tenants. Lectures are used to set out different issues and will use examples and case law to illustrate problems that can occur and how to recognise and avoid these. You will be able to develop and deepen your understanding through supported tutorials, where you will be able to ask questions and practise responding to client-focused scenarios.\n\n \n\nThe aims of the module are to:\n\n1.       Illustrate the importance and complexities of property law in asset and place management.\n\n2.       Explain and use examples to show how statute and case law underpin legal obligations of real estate professionals.\n\n3.       Consider how property law relates to the broader legal and fiscal background and prevailing market conditions, and how this impacts on real estate.\n15 credits\n\n\nReal Estate Planning and Development Project\n\n\nReal estate development involves several interconnected factors such as land acquisition, design and planning consent, construction and marketing / disposal. It requires developers to make informed decisions based on multiple appraisals of market, planning, financial and risk factors. Planning in particular plays a crucial role in shaping real estate development projects. It provides a framework for decision making, can promote sustainable development and ensure development projects contribute positively to the built environment. At the same time, planning can also impose constraints that can limit the scope and nature of projects. Studying the real estate development process will enhance your ability to analyse complex problems, develop effective solutions, and learn valuable decision-making skills.  \n\nThe module builds upon the principles of land and development introduced in the Autumn semester. It focuses on the interrelationship between real estate development and spatial planning and explores the main aspects of development appraisal.  You will work towards producing an assessment of the planning potential and viability considerations for a real-world development site in an integrated way that fully accounts for the relevant institutional and legal frameworks. The module therefore includes coverage of: market research, planning appraisal, financial appraisal (including financial appraisal using residual and cash-flow methods), sustainability considerations, sources and methods of development finance, sources and management of risk and uncertainty; and the influence of the planning system on real estate development and investment.\n\nThe aims of the module are to:\n\n- Enable you to assess development potential and understand the various influences upon it, including planning policy and design considerations\n\n- Allow you to develop a solution that offers the greatest likelihood of a successful outcome \n\n- Develop your appreciation of the theoretical and practical justification of the solution\n\n- Allow you to deepen your skills in project management, development appraisal, financial analysis and the clear presentation of complex information in professional business report form\n15 credits\n\n\nInnovation and Digital Transformation\n\n\nThe real estate profession is changing and in recent decades, real estate use, operations and service have evolved significantly as a result of demographic and socio-cultural changes and the advancement of digital technology. This module will introduce you to a wide range of innovative systems, digital tools and platforms that underpin contemporary real estate use and services. You will also be able to develop soft employability skills such as creativity, entrepreneurship, teamworking, collaboration and problem-solving. \n\nThe module allows you to understand the links between various segments of the real estate value chain and to appreciate the environmental, social, economic and physical (ESEP) inefficiencies and challenges within the sector. You will be introduced to a wide range of advanced digital tools such as Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, blockchain, virtual reality and drones and you will be able to learn about how these tools are creating a new ecosystem of digital technology within the real estate sector (commonly referred to as PropTech). You will also be challenged to critically reflect on existing innovative systems and digital tools within the real estate sector and to identify opportunities for more effective and efficient systems and approaches. The module will also introduce you to emerging concepts such as the sharing economy and operational real estate which have developed in the last couple of decades. Your learning will be supported by case study analysis, group discussions, workshops and guest presentations from industry experts.\n\nLearning will be delivered through a combination of problem-oriented, collaborative and project-based learning approaches which will enable you to develop skills such as creativity, communication, strategic thinking, entrepreneurship, teamwork and problem solving.  \n\nThe aims of the module are to: \n\nIntroduce you to the full spectrum of the real estate value chain and the links between them; \n\nExplore the emerging areas of real estate practice and their roles and functions in real estate markets;\n\nExplore the various environmental, social, economic and physical inefficiencies and challenges within the built environment sector and demonstrate the role of innovation and digital technology in addressing them;\n\nSupport you to develop problem-solving, innovative, and creative skills that can enable various dimensions of solutions to a wide range of challenges in the built environment industry.\n15 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will complete your dissertation over the summer.\n\n\n\n Core module:\n\n\nReal Estate Research Project\n\n\nThis core module is a major research project that offers you the opportunity to develop and manage an individual empirical research project of specialist surveying concern. During the module, you will get the opportunity to develop and apply research skills and develop an appreciation of the issues involved in managing a real estate research project, which may include sourcing and analysing property data in a research context. You will have the opportunity to gain experience in the key stages of undertaking a research project, including identifying a topic; conducting a review of existing knowledge; identifying research questions; selecting methods; designing and conducting a project of specialist surveying concern; and presenting the outcome of the project in a logical and coherent written format. In taking this module, you will be able to deepen your knowledge and experience of conducting research in an area of specialist surveying concern. \n\nThe module aims to give you the opportunity to experience conducting an original research project with supervisory guidance. More specifically, it aims to:\n\n- Enable you to develop skills in topic selection and refinement; research design skills and project management;\n\n- Let you develop an understanding of the role of research in relation to theoretical and practical dimensions of the surveying discipline;\n\n- Allow you to further and deepen knowledge in a chosen field of specialist surveying concern;\n\n- Offer you the opportunity to build on knowledge of specific research methods and analytical techniques and develop skills in independent research.\n60 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content of our courses is reviewed annually to make sure it's up-to-date and relevant.

Cultures of Learning and Professional Skills - understanding how we teach at Sheffield, how to get the most out of your study and how to develop key generic professional/soft skills 2. Employability Skills - preparing you for careers within planning, design, real estate, GIS and related professional areas.\n\n\n\nThe aims of this  module are: \n\n1. to provide a range of supporting skills for home and international students, which will help you get the most out of your learning in Sheffield\n\n2. to prepare you for professional employment and career development at the end of your studies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second semester focuses on the development, application and integration of knowledge and skills.\n\n\n\n Core modules:\n\n\nInvestment Valuation\n\n\nThis module builds on the principles of valuation introduced in the Autumn Semester. It focuses on the valuation of office, retail and industrial real estate, together comprising the most common type of commercial real estate, dominating the landscape of the built environment. The investment method of valuation, introduced in 'Applied Real Estate Valuation', is revisited and the basic principles are extended to allow a more advanced analysis of value. This is important as client requirements increasingly diverge with respect to investment criteria, and as economic and sustainability contexts shift.\n\n \n\nIn this module you are introduced to the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) approach to real estate valuation, an approach increasingly important for members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and offering transparency for clients and sensitivity and scenario analysis in the light of future uncertainties. Each week you will participate in interactive lectures where principles are introduced and explained through the use of client-focused scenarios, and you will have the opportunity to develop your knowledge and skills in DCF, supported by weekly tutorials. This module is based on developing DCF spreadsheets using excel, enabling you to develop employability skills in the areas of digital numeracy and commercial awareness. This approach explicitly places valuation within economic and political contexts, allowing scenarios to be explored as these wider contexts shift. You will be able to learn how to respond to different scenarios and client requirements. For example, you will see how DCF can be effectively used to assess the viability of improving the sustainability of real estate and how to respond and provide strategic advice to clients in the light of the challenges this brings. You will be guided through how to provide advice to clients considering purchasing real estate and how opportunities can be evaluated against target rates of return. Using feedback provided during 'Applied Real Estate Valuation' in the first semester, in this second semester module you will be able to deepen your skills in preparing and presenting a client-focused professional valuation report.\n\n \n\nThe aims of the module are to:\n\n1.       Enable you to develop skills in developing and using DCF valuation techniques in response to client requirements.\n\n2.       Reflect on the basic valuation inputs and extend the analysis to better reflect asset characteristics and economic contexts.\n\n3.       Allow you to deepen your skills in carrying out and presenting valuation work with regard to the highest professional and ethical standards.\n15 credits\n\n\nProperty Law\n\n\nManaging real estate assets is fundamental to their successful operation and ongoing viability. It is therefore core to the success of places and resilience in the built environment. Yet the complexities and legal systems involved in this management is little understood by many professionals involved in safeguarding the future of places. The liabilities of real estate owners and occupiers underpin the investment performance of real estate assets and in this module you will be introduced to this fascinating area.\n\n \n\nYou will be able to learn about a range of important areas for real estate professionals, such as the property law issues that can prevent or restrict new developments, and the legal responsibilities for asset managers, and how these issues can impact on property values. You will get to study and understand how to avoid acting with professional negligence in your career, and how to recognise and appreciate legal rights and obligations, including of buyers, sellers, landlords and tenants. Lectures are used to set out different issues and will use examples and case law to illustrate problems that can occur and how to recognise and avoid these. You will be able to develop and deepen your understanding through supported tutorials, where you will be able to ask questions and practise responding to client-focused scenarios.\n\n \n\nThe aims of the module are to:\n\n1.       Illustrate the importance and complexities of property law in asset and place management.\n\n2.       Explain and use examples to show how statute and case law underpin legal obligations of real estate professionals.\n\n3.       Consider how property law relates to the broader legal and fiscal background and prevailing market conditions, and how this impacts on real estate.\n15 credits\n\n\nReal Estate Planning and Development Project\n\n\nReal estate development involves several interconnected factors such as land acquisition, design and planning consent, construction and marketing / disposal. It requires developers to make informed decisions based on multiple appraisals of market, planning, financial and risk factors. Planning in particular plays a crucial role in shaping real estate development projects. It provides a framework for decision making, can promote sustainable development and ensure development projects contribute positively to the built environment. At the same time, planning can also impose constraints that can limit the scope and nature of projects. Studying the real estate development process will enhance your ability to analyse complex problems, develop effective solutions, and learn valuable decision-making skills.  \n\nThe module builds upon the principles of land and development introduced in the Autumn semester. It focuses on the interrelationship between real estate development and spatial planning and explores the main aspects of development appraisal.  You will work towards producing an assessment of the planning potential and viability considerations for a real-world development site in an integrated way that fully accounts for the relevant institutional and legal frameworks. The module therefore includes coverage of: market research, planning appraisal, financial appraisal (including financial appraisal using residual and cash-flow methods), sustainability considerations, sources and methods of development finance, sources and management of risk and uncertainty; and the influence of the planning system on real estate development and investment.\n\nThe aims of the module are to:\n\n- Enable you to assess development potential and understand the various influences upon it, including planning policy and design considerations\n\n- Allow you to develop a solution that offers the greatest likelihood of a successful outcome \n\n- Develop your appreciation of the theoretical and practical justification of the solution\n\n- Allow you to deepen your skills in project management, development appraisal, financial analysis and the clear presentation of complex information in professional business report form\n15 credits\n\n\nInnovation and Digital Transformation\n\n\nThe real estate profession is changing and in recent decades, real estate use, operations and service have evolved significantly as a result of demographic and socio-cultural changes and the advancement of digital technology. This module will introduce you to a wide range of innovative systems, digital tools and platforms that underpin contemporary real estate use and services. You will also be able to develop soft employability skills such as creativity, entrepreneurship, teamworking, collaboration and problem-solving. \n\nThe module allows you to understand the links between various segments of the real estate value chain and to appreciate the environmental, social, economic and physical (ESEP) inefficiencies and challenges within the sector. You will be introduced to a wide range of advanced digital tools such as Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, blockchain, virtual reality and drones and you will be able to learn about how these tools are creating a new ecosystem of digital technology within the real estate sector (commonly referred to as PropTech). You will also be challenged to critically reflect on existing innovative systems and digital tools within the real estate sector and to identify opportunities for more effective and efficient systems and approaches. The module will also introduce you to emerging concepts such as the sharing economy and operational real estate which have developed in the last couple of decades. Your learning will be supported by case study analysis, group discussions, workshops and guest presentations from industry experts.\n\nLearning will be delivered through a combination of problem-oriented, collaborative and project-based learning approaches which will enable you to develop skills such as creativity, communication, strategic thinking, entrepreneurship, teamwork and problem solving.  \n\nThe aims of the module are to: \n\nIntroduce you to the full spectrum of the real estate value chain and the links between them; \n\nExplore the emerging areas of real estate practice and their roles and functions in real estate markets;\n\nExplore the various environmental, social, economic and physical inefficiencies and challenges within the built environment sector and demonstrate the role of innovation and digital technology in addressing them;\n\nSupport you to develop problem-solving, innovative, and creative skills that can enable various dimensions of solutions to a wide range of challenges in the built environment industry.\n15 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will complete your dissertation over the summer.\n\n\n\n Core module:\n\n\nReal Estate Research Project\n\n\nThis core module is a major research project that offers you the opportunity to develop and manage an individual empirical research project of specialist surveying concern. During the module, you will get the opportunity to develop and apply research skills and develop an appreciation of the issues involved in managing a real estate research project, which may include sourcing and analysing property data in a research context. You will have the opportunity to gain experience in the key stages of undertaking a research project, including identifying a topic; conducting a review of existing knowledge; identifying research questions; selecting methods; designing and conducting a project of specialist surveying concern; and presenting the outcome of the project in a logical and coherent written format. In taking this module, you will be able to deepen your knowledge and experience of conducting research in an area of specialist surveying concern. \n\nThe module aims to give you the opportunity to experience conducting an original research project with supervisory guidance. More specifically, it aims to:\n\n- Enable you to develop skills in topic selection and refinement; research design skills and project management;\n\n- Let you develop an understanding of the role of research in relation to theoretical and practical dimensions of the surveying discipline;\n\n- Allow you to further and deepen knowledge in a chosen field of specialist surveying concern;\n\n- Offer you the opportunity to build on knowledge of specific research methods and analytical techniques and develop skills in independent research.\n60 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content of our courses is reviewed annually to make sure it's up-to-date and relevant.

Land provides the foundation, while planning outlines the vision. Development brings the vision to life, and professional ethical standards ensure stakeholders have the necessary knowledge and skills to perform their duties effectively, professionally and ethically, in accordance with the professional rules of conduct and regulations. A strong grasp of these interconnected elements will empower you to make informed decisions, mitigate risks, and create sustainable, thriving communities. By aligning development goals with ethical principles, you will develop an appreciation of how development can have a positive and lasting impact.\n\nThe module aims to:\n\n- Introduce you to the core knowledge and characteristics of land and development markets, with a particular focus on sustainability \n\n- Allow you to understand development appraisal techniques and how planning, design and risk influence developer profit and development feasibility\n\n- Enable you to the understand the importance of professional rules of conduct and the complexities of dealing with difficult situations in an ethically appropriate and defensible manner\n15 credits\n\n\nApplied Real Estate Valuation\n\n\nValuation is at the core of the real estate industry. It underpins work across multiple specialisms, such as buying and selling real estate assets; managing investment portfolios; developing new real estate; regenerating areas to enhance resilience and improve the local economy and sense of place; and ensuring sustainability in the built environment.  \n\n \n\nIn this module you will be able to learn about the basic building blocks of valuation, the financial maths tools that will stay with you throughout your studies and career. These are presented to you using client-focused scenarios, with many opportunities to practise and gain familiarity through both supported problem-solving tutorials and a bespoke online tool with built-in help and guidance. The module then moves onto the next stage and you will see how you can use these valuation tools to undertake more complex and applied professional work. This stage focuses on the five methods of valuation (comparable, investment, profits, residual and contractors) that you will need throughout your career and that will give you the flexibility to specialise as your interests develop. Throughout this stage, interactive lectures will be used to explain worked examples with further scenarios for you to tackle to begin to develop and apply your knowledge and skills, as well as through weekly tutorials.\n\n \n\nDuring the module, you will get to use industry data to prepare your own valuations, and you will be taken through guidance set out by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors on working to the highest professional, ethical and sustainability standards.  \n\n \n\nThe aims of the module are to:\n\n1.       Explain and apply the basic financial maths valuation tools to simple client-focused scenarios;\n\n2.       Introduce and illustrate the five methods of valuation used across real estate core and specialist areas of work;\n\n3.       Explore and demonstrate the importance of robust data collection, analysis and presentation within professionally-defensible valuations; and\n\n4.       Guide you through the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors' standards to ensure work can be undertaken to meet the highest client-facing professional, ethical and sustainability standards.\n15 credits\n\n\nReal Estate Economics\n\n\nExploring and gaining understanding of the economics of real estate at the start of your studies will provide you with the foundations of knowledge needed across core and specialist areas such as valuation, development and investment. This module allows you to develop a deep understanding of the real estate market and you will be able to learn about how the market works, what influences it, and how it operates. The module also helps you to develop skills in analysing real estate data. \n\nThis module presents a comprehensive exploration of real estate economics, starting with the fundamentals and moving towards more advanced analysis. It begins with foundational knowledge on the structure of real estate markets, micro and macroeconomic influences, and core real estate sectors, including sustainable practice. You will be challenged to think about and apply this knowledge with a global perspective, by participating in workshops focusing on international real estate activities and practices. You will hear from industry experts on topics such as globally important markets, emerging issues, and case studies of market change. The latter part of the module equips you with analytical skills, featuring workshops on commercial and housing market analysis. Throughout the module, you'll be able to engage in practical exercises to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios, preparing you for dynamic roles in the real estate industry.\n\nThe aims of the module are to:\n\n1. Explore the structure and operation of real estate markets, including the linkages between real estate and wider economy.\n\n2. Examine the impact of globalisation on real estate, including international market dynamics and practice.\n\n3. Provide an understanding of real estate market analysis.\n15 credits\n\n\nReal Estate Investment\n\n\nReal estate presents developers, investors and asset managers with both unique opportunities and risks. In this module you will be able to learn about the characteristics of real estate, the opportunities it provides for investors, and how it compares to other investment classes. You will be guided through the theories that can be used to inform investment decisions when building and managing a portfolio of real estate assets. You will get to use real estate data for UK and international global real estate markets to explore how these investment theories can be used in practice, and you will be able to develop and practise new skills to analyse a simulated international portfolio management task. Core principles and ideas are set out in lectures, and supported workshops will help you to develop skills in data analysis and understand how your growing professional specialist knowledge can inform your decision-making and analysis.\n\n The module will also explore important and contemporary topics in real estate investment, and you will be challenged to think about areas such as how sustainability is shifting the investment landscape, and how behaviours can affect decision-making and investment outcomes. The module will allow you to develop skills in combining your real estate investment knowledge and analytical skills in a professional report responding to a client-based portfolio management task.\n\n \n\nThe aims of the module are to:\n\n1.       Introduce and explore the characteristics of real estate and the opportunities and risks this provides.\n\n2.       Examine how investment theories can guide decision-making.\n\n3.       Enable development of digital numeracy skills and the application of these to data analysis and portfolio management scenarios.\n\n4.       Encourage skills in professional report writing and provision of evidenced recommendations for portfolio management.\n15 credits\n\n\nEmployability and Professional Skills\n\n\nAs professional skills become increasingly vital for workplace success, this module will allow you to develop a range of supporting skills that will enhance your learning experience at Sheffield and prepare you for a successful career. \n\nThe module has two elements: 1. Cultures of Learning and Professional Skills - understanding how we teach at Sheffield, how to get the most out of your study and how to develop key generic professional/soft skills 2. Employability Skills - preparing you for careers within planning, design, real estate, GIS and related professional areas.\n\n\n\nThe aims of this  module are: \n\n1. to provide a range of supporting skills for home and international students, which will help you get the most out of your learning in Sheffield\n\n2. to prepare you for professional employment and career development at the end of your studies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second semester focuses on the development, application and integration of knowledge and skills.\n\n\n\n Core modules:\n\n\nInvestment Valuation\n\n\nThis module builds on the principles of valuation introduced in the Autumn Semester. It focuses on the valuation of office, retail and industrial real estate, together comprising the most common type of commercial real estate, dominating the landscape of the built environment. The investment method of valuation, introduced in 'Applied Real Estate Valuation', is revisited and the basic principles are extended to allow a more advanced analysis of value. This is important as client requirements increasingly diverge with respect to investment criteria, and as economic and sustainability contexts shift.\n\n \n\nIn this module you are introduced to the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) approach to real estate valuation, an approach increasingly important for members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and offering transparency for clients and sensitivity and scenario analysis in the light of future uncertainties. Each week you will participate in interactive lectures where principles are introduced and explained through the use of client-focused scenarios, and you will have the opportunity to develop your knowledge and skills in DCF, supported by weekly tutorials. This module is based on developing DCF spreadsheets using excel, enabling you to develop employability skills in the areas of digital numeracy and commercial awareness. This approach explicitly places valuation within economic and political contexts, allowing scenarios to be explored as these wider contexts shift. You will be able to learn how to respond to different scenarios and client requirements. For example, you will see how DCF can be effectively used to assess the viability of improving the sustainability of real estate and how to respond and provide strategic advice to clients in the light of the challenges this brings. You will be guided through how to provide advice to clients considering purchasing real estate and how opportunities can be evaluated against target rates of return. Using feedback provided during 'Applied Real Estate Valuation' in the first semester, in this second semester module you will be able to deepen your skills in preparing and presenting a client-focused professional valuation report.\n\n \n\nThe aims of the module are to:\n\n1.       Enable you to develop skills in developing and using DCF valuation techniques in response to client requirements.\n\n2.       Reflect on the basic valuation inputs and extend the analysis to better reflect asset characteristics and economic contexts.\n\n3.       Allow you to deepen your skills in carrying out and presenting valuation work with regard to the highest professional and ethical standards.\n15 credits\n\n\nProperty Law\n\n\nManaging real estate assets is fundamental to their successful operation and ongoing viability. It is therefore core to the success of places and resilience in the built environment. Yet the complexities and legal systems involved in this management is little understood by many professionals involved in safeguarding the future of places. The liabilities of real estate owners and occupiers underpin the investment performance of real estate assets and in this module you will be introduced to this fascinating area.\n\n \n\nYou will be able to learn about a range of important areas for real estate professionals, such as the property law issues that can prevent or restrict new developments, and the legal responsibilities for asset managers, and how these issues can impact on property values. You will get to study and understand how to avoid acting with professional negligence in your career, and how to recognise and appreciate legal rights and obligations, including of buyers, sellers, landlords and tenants. Lectures are used to set out different issues and will use examples and case law to illustrate problems that can occur and how to recognise and avoid these. You will be able to develop and deepen your understanding through supported tutorials, where you will be able to ask questions and practise responding to client-focused scenarios.\n\n \n\nThe aims of the module are to:\n\n1.       Illustrate the importance and complexities of property law in asset and place management.\n\n2.       Explain and use examples to show how statute and case law underpin legal obligations of real estate professionals.\n\n3.       Consider how property law relates to the broader legal and fiscal background and prevailing market conditions, and how this impacts on real estate.\n15 credits\n\n\nReal Estate Planning and Development Project\n\n\nReal estate development involves several interconnected factors such as land acquisition, design and planning consent, construction and marketing / disposal. It requires developers to make informed decisions based on multiple appraisals of market, planning, financial and risk factors. Planning in particular plays a crucial role in shaping real estate development projects. It provides a framework for decision making, can promote sustainable development and ensure development projects contribute positively to the built environment. At the same time, planning can also impose constraints that can limit the scope and nature of projects. Studying the real estate development process will enhance your ability to analyse complex problems, develop effective solutions, and learn valuable decision-making skills.  \n\nThe module builds upon the principles of land and development introduced in the Autumn semester. It focuses on the interrelationship between real estate development and spatial planning and explores the main aspects of development appraisal.  You will work towards producing an assessment of the planning potential and viability considerations for a real-world development site in an integrated way that fully accounts for the relevant institutional and legal frameworks. The module therefore includes coverage of: market research, planning appraisal, financial appraisal (including financial appraisal using residual and cash-flow methods), sustainability considerations, sources and methods of development finance, sources and management of risk and uncertainty; and the influence of the planning system on real estate development and investment.\n\nThe aims of the module are to:\n\n- Enable you to assess development potential and understand the various influences upon it, including planning policy and design considerations\n\n- Allow you to develop a solution that offers the greatest likelihood of a successful outcome \n\n- Develop your appreciation of the theoretical and practical justification of the solution\n\n- Allow you to deepen your skills in project management, development appraisal, financial analysis and the clear presentation of complex information in professional business report form\n15 credits\n\n\nInnovation and Digital Transformation\n\n\nThe real estate profession is changing and in recent decades, real estate use, operations and service have evolved significantly as a result of demographic and socio-cultural changes and the advancement of digital technology. This module will introduce you to a wide range of innovative systems, digital tools and platforms that underpin contemporary real estate use and services. You will also be able to develop soft employability skills such as creativity, entrepreneurship, teamworking, collaboration and problem-solving. \n\nThe module allows you to understand the links between various segments of the real estate value chain and to appreciate the environmental, social, economic and physical (ESEP) inefficiencies and challenges within the sector. You will be introduced to a wide range of advanced digital tools such as Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, blockchain, virtual reality and drones and you will be able to learn about how these tools are creating a new ecosystem of digital technology within the real estate sector (commonly referred to as PropTech). You will also be challenged to critically reflect on existing innovative systems and digital tools within the real estate sector and to identify opportunities for more effective and efficient systems and approaches. The module will also introduce you to emerging concepts such as the sharing economy and operational real estate which have developed in the last couple of decades.

It underpins work across multiple specialisms, such as buying and selling real estate assets; managing investment portfolios; developing new real estate; regenerating areas to enhance resilience and improve the local economy and sense of place; and ensuring sustainability in the built environment.  \n\n \n\nIn this module you will be able to learn about the basic building blocks of valuation, the financial maths tools that will stay with you throughout your studies and career. These are presented to you using client-focused scenarios, with many opportunities to practise and gain familiarity through both supported problem-solving tutorials and a bespoke online tool with built-in help and guidance. The module then moves onto the next stage and you will see how you can use these valuation tools to undertake more complex and applied professional work. This stage focuses on the five methods of valuation (comparable, investment, profits, residual and contractors) that you will need throughout your career and that will give you the flexibility to specialise as your interests develop. Throughout this stage, interactive lectures will be used to explain worked examples with further scenarios for you to tackle to begin to develop and apply your knowledge and skills, as well as through weekly tutorials.\n\n \n\nDuring the module, you will get to use industry data to prepare your own valuations, and you will be taken through guidance set out by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors on working to the highest professional, ethical and sustainability standards.  \n\n \n\nThe aims of the module are to:\n\n1.       Explain and apply the basic financial maths valuation tools to simple client-focused scenarios;\n\n2.       Introduce and illustrate the five methods of valuation used across real estate core and specialist areas of work;\n\n3.       Explore and demonstrate the importance of robust data collection, analysis and presentation within professionally-defensible valuations; and\n\n4.       Guide you through the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors' standards to ensure work can be undertaken to meet the highest client-facing professional, ethical and sustainability standards.\n15 credits\n\n\nReal Estate Economics\n\n\nExploring and gaining understanding of the economics of real estate at the start of your studies will provide you with the foundations of knowledge needed across core and specialist areas such as valuation, development and investment. This module allows you to develop a deep understanding of the real estate market and you will be able to learn about how the market works, what influences it, and how it operates. The module also helps you to develop skills in analysing real estate data. \n\nThis module presents a comprehensive exploration of real estate economics, starting with the fundamentals and moving towards more advanced analysis. It begins with foundational knowledge on the structure of real estate markets, micro and macroeconomic influences, and core real estate sectors, including sustainable practice. You will be challenged to think about and apply this knowledge with a global perspective, by participating in workshops focusing on international real estate activities and practices. You will hear from industry experts on topics such as globally important markets, emerging issues, and case studies of market change. The latter part of the module equips you with analytical skills, featuring workshops on commercial and housing market analysis. Throughout the module, you'll be able to engage in practical exercises to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios, preparing you for dynamic roles in the real estate industry.\n\nThe aims of the module are to:\n\n1. Explore the structure and operation of real estate markets, including the linkages between real estate and wider economy.\n\n2. Examine the impact of globalisation on real estate, including international market dynamics and practice.\n\n3. Provide an understanding of real estate market analysis.\n15 credits\n\n\nReal Estate Investment\n\n\nReal estate presents developers, investors and asset managers with both unique opportunities and risks. In this module you will be able to learn about the characteristics of real estate, the opportunities it provides for investors, and how it compares to other investment classes. You will be guided through the theories that can be used to inform investment decisions when building and managing a portfolio of real estate assets. You will get to use real estate data for UK and international global real estate markets to explore how these investment theories can be used in practice, and you will be able to develop and practise new skills to analyse a simulated international portfolio management task. Core principles and ideas are set out in lectures, and supported workshops will help you to develop skills in data analysis and understand how your growing professional specialist knowledge can inform your decision-making and analysis.\n\n The module will also explore important and contemporary topics in real estate investment, and you will be challenged to think about areas such as how sustainability is shifting the investment landscape, and how behaviours can affect decision-making and investment outcomes. The module will allow you to develop skills in combining your real estate investment knowledge and analytical skills in a professional report responding to a client-based portfolio management task.\n\n \n\nThe aims of the module are to:\n\n1.       Introduce and explore the characteristics of real estate and the opportunities and risks this provides.\n\n2.       Examine how investment theories can guide decision-making.\n\n3.       Enable development of digital numeracy skills and the application of these to data analysis and portfolio management scenarios.\n\n4.       Encourage skills in professional report writing and provision of evidenced recommendations for portfolio management.\n15 credits\n\n\nEmployability and Professional Skills\n\n\nAs professional skills become increasingly vital for workplace success, this module will allow you to develop a range of supporting skills that will enhance your learning experience at Sheffield and prepare you for a successful career. \n\nThe module has two elements: 1. Cultures of Learning and Professional Skills - understanding how we teach at Sheffield, how to get the most out of your study and how to develop key generic professional/soft skills 2. Employability Skills - preparing you for careers within planning, design, real estate, GIS and related professional areas.\n\n\n\nThe aims of this  module are: \n\n1. to provide a range of supporting skills for home and international students, which will help you get the most out of your learning in Sheffield\n\n2. to prepare you for professional employment and career development at the end of your studies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second semester focuses on the development, application and integration of knowledge and skills.\n\n\n\n Core modules:\n\n\nInvestment Valuation\n\n\nThis module builds on the principles of valuation introduced in the Autumn Semester. It focuses on the valuation of office, retail and industrial real estate, together comprising the most common type of commercial real estate, dominating the landscape of the built environment. The investment method of valuation, introduced in 'Applied Real Estate Valuation', is revisited and the basic principles are extended to allow a more advanced analysis of value. This is important as client requirements increasingly diverge with respect to investment criteria, and as economic and sustainability contexts shift.\n\n \n\nIn this module you are introduced to the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) approach to real estate valuation, an approach increasingly important for members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and offering transparency for clients and sensitivity and scenario analysis in the light of future uncertainties. Each week you will participate in interactive lectures where principles are introduced and explained through the use of client-focused scenarios, and you will have the opportunity to develop your knowledge and skills in DCF, supported by weekly tutorials. This module is based on developing DCF spreadsheets using excel, enabling you to develop employability skills in the areas of digital numeracy and commercial awareness. This approach explicitly places valuation within economic and political contexts, allowing scenarios to be explored as these wider contexts shift. You will be able to learn how to respond to different scenarios and client requirements. For example, you will see how DCF can be effectively used to assess the viability of improving the sustainability of real estate and how to respond and provide strategic advice to clients in the light of the challenges this brings. You will be guided through how to provide advice to clients considering purchasing real estate and how opportunities can be evaluated against target rates of return. Using feedback provided during 'Applied Real Estate Valuation' in the first semester, in this second semester module you will be able to deepen your skills in preparing and presenting a client-focused professional valuation report.\n\n \n\nThe aims of the module are to:\n\n1.       Enable you to develop skills in developing and using DCF valuation techniques in response to client requirements.\n\n2.       Reflect on the basic valuation inputs and extend the analysis to better reflect asset characteristics and economic contexts.\n\n3.       Allow you to deepen your skills in carrying out and presenting valuation work with regard to the highest professional and ethical standards.\n15 credits\n\n\nProperty Law\n\n\nManaging real estate assets is fundamental to their successful operation and ongoing viability. It is therefore core to the success of places and resilience in the built environment. Yet the complexities and legal systems involved in this management is little understood by many professionals involved in safeguarding the future of places. The liabilities of real estate owners and occupiers underpin the investment performance of real estate assets and in this module you will be introduced to this fascinating area.\n\n \n\nYou will be able to learn about a range of important areas for real estate professionals, such as the property law issues that can prevent or restrict new developments, and the legal responsibilities for asset managers, and how these issues can impact on property values. You will get to study and understand how to avoid acting with professional negligence in your career, and how to recognise and appreciate legal rights and obligations, including of buyers, sellers, landlords and tenants. Lectures are used to set out different issues and will use examples and case law to illustrate problems that can occur and how to recognise and avoid these. You will be able to develop and deepen your understanding through supported tutorials, where you will be able to ask questions and practise responding to client-focused scenarios.\n\n \n\nThe aims of the module are to:\n\n1.       Illustrate the importance and complexities of property law in asset and place management.\n\n2.       Explain and use examples to show how statute and case law underpin legal obligations of real estate professionals.\n\n3.       Consider how property law relates to the broader legal and fiscal background and prevailing market conditions, and how this impacts on real estate.\n15 credits\n\n\nReal Estate Planning and Development Project\n\n\nReal estate development involves several interconnected factors such as land acquisition, design and planning consent, construction and marketing / disposal. It requires developers to make informed decisions based on multiple appraisals of market, planning, financial and risk factors. Planning in particular plays a crucial role in shaping real estate development projects. It provides a framework for decision making, can promote sustainable development and ensure development projects contribute positively to the built environment. At the same time, planning can also impose constraints that can limit the scope and nature of projects. Studying the real estate development process will enhance your ability to analyse complex problems, develop effective solutions, and learn valuable decision-making skills.  \n\nThe module builds upon the principles of land and development introduced in the Autumn semester. It focuses on the interrelationship between real estate development and spatial planning and explores the main aspects of development appraisal.  You will work towards producing an assessment of the planning potential and viability considerations for a real-world development site in an integrated way that fully accounts for the relevant institutional and legal frameworks. The module therefore includes coverage of: market research, planning appraisal, financial appraisal (including financial appraisal using residual and cash-flow methods), sustainability considerations, sources and methods of development finance, sources and management of risk and uncertainty; and the influence of the planning system on real estate development and investment.\n\nThe aims of the module are to:\n\n- Enable you to assess development potential and understand the various influences upon it, including planning policy and design considerations\n\n- Allow you to develop a solution that offers the greatest likelihood of a successful outcome \n\n- Develop your appreciation of the theoretical and practical justification of the solution\n\n- Allow you to deepen your skills in project management, development appraisal, financial analysis and the clear presentation of complex information in professional business report form\n15 credits\n\n\nInnovation and Digital Transformation\n\n\nThe real estate profession is changing and in recent decades, real estate use, operations and service have evolved significantly as a result of demographic and socio-cultural changes and the advancement of digital technology. This module will introduce you to a wide range of innovative systems, digital tools and platforms that underpin contemporary real estate use and services. You will also be able to develop soft employability skills such as creativity, entrepreneurship, teamworking, collaboration and problem-solving. \n\nThe module allows you to understand the links between various segments of the real estate value chain and to appreciate the environmental, social, economic and physical (ESEP) inefficiencies and challenges within the sector. You will be introduced to a wide range of advanced digital tools such as Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, blockchain, virtual reality and drones and you will be able to learn about how these tools are creating a new ecosystem of digital technology within the real estate sector (commonly referred to as PropTech). You will also be challenged to critically reflect on existing innovative systems and digital tools within the real estate sector and to identify opportunities for more effective and efficient systems and approaches. The module will also introduce you to emerging concepts such as the sharing economy and operational real estate which have developed in the last couple of decades. Your learning will be supported by case study analysis, group discussions, workshops and guest presentations from industry experts.\n\nLearning will be delivered through a combination of problem-oriented, collaborative and project-based learning approaches which will enable you to develop skills such as creativity, communication, strategic thinking, entrepreneurship, teamwork and problem solving.  \n\nThe aims of the module are to: \n\nIntroduce you to the full spectrum of the real estate value chain and the links between them; \n\nExplore the emerging areas of real estate practice and their roles and functions in real estate markets;\n\nExplore the various environmental, social, economic and physical inefficiencies and challenges within the built environment sector and demonstrate the role of innovation and digital technology in addressing them;\n\nSupport you to develop problem-solving, innovative, and creative skills that can enable various dimensions of solutions to a wide range of challenges in the built environment industry.\n15 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will complete your dissertation over the summer.\n\n\n\n Core module:\n\n\nReal Estate Research Project\n\n\nThis core module is a major research project that offers you the opportunity to develop and manage an individual empirical research project of specialist surveying concern. During the module, you will get the opportunity to develop and apply research skills and develop an appreciation of the issues involved in managing a real estate research project, which may include sourcing and analysing property data in a research context. You will have the opportunity to gain experience in the key stages of undertaking a research project, including identifying a topic; conducting a review of existing knowledge; identifying research questions; selecting methods; designing and conducting a project of specialist surveying concern; and presenting the outcome of the project in a logical and coherent written format. In taking this module, you will be able to deepen your knowledge and experience of conducting research in an area of specialist surveying concern. \n\nThe module aims to give you the opportunity to experience conducting an original research project with supervisory guidance. More specifically, it aims to:\n\n- Enable you to develop skills in topic selection and refinement; research design skills and project management;\n\n- Let you develop an understanding of the role of research in relation to theoretical and practical dimensions of the surveying discipline;\n\n- Allow you to further and deepen knowledge in a chosen field of specialist surveying concern;\n\n- Offer you the opportunity to build on knowledge of specific research methods and analytical techniques and develop skills in independent research.\n60 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content of our courses is reviewed annually to make sure it's up-to-date and relevant.

Throughout this stage, interactive lectures will be used to explain worked examples with further scenarios for you to tackle to begin to develop and apply your knowledge and skills, as well as through weekly tutorials.\n\n \n\nDuring the module, you will get to use industry data to prepare your own valuations, and you will be taken through guidance set out by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors on working to the highest professional, ethical and sustainability standards.  \n\n \n\nThe aims of the module are to:\n\n1.       Explain and apply the basic financial maths valuation tools to simple client-focused scenarios;\n\n2.       Introduce and illustrate the five methods of valuation used across real estate core and specialist areas of work;\n\n3.       Explore and demonstrate the importance of robust data collection, analysis and presentation within professionally-defensible valuations; and\n\n4.       Guide you through the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors' standards to ensure work can be undertaken to meet the highest client-facing professional, ethical and sustainability standards.\n15 credits\n\n\nReal Estate Economics\n\n\nExploring and gaining understanding of the economics of real estate at the start of your studies will provide you with the foundations of knowledge needed across core and specialist areas such as valuation, development and investment. This module allows you to develop a deep understanding of the real estate market and you will be able to learn about how the market works, what influences it, and how it operates. The module also helps you to develop skills in analysing real estate data. \n\nThis module presents a comprehensive exploration of real estate economics, starting with the fundamentals and moving towards more advanced analysis. It begins with foundational knowledge on the structure of real estate markets, micro and macroeconomic influences, and core real estate sectors, including sustainable practice. You will be challenged to think about and apply this knowledge with a global perspective, by participating in workshops focusing on international real estate activities and practices. You will hear from industry experts on topics such as globally important markets, emerging issues, and case studies of market change. The latter part of the module equips you with analytical skills, featuring workshops on commercial and housing market analysis. Throughout the module, you'll be able to engage in practical exercises to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios, preparing you for dynamic roles in the real estate industry.\n\nThe aims of the module are to:\n\n1.

In this module you will be able to learn about the characteristics of real estate, the opportunities it provides for investors, and how it compares to other investment classes. You will be guided through the theories that can be used to inform investment decisions when building and managing a portfolio of real estate assets. You will get to use real estate data for UK and international global real estate markets to explore how these investment theories can be used in practice, and you will be able to develop and practise new skills to analyse a simulated international portfolio management task. Core principles and ideas are set out in lectures, and supported workshops will help you to develop skills in data analysis and understand how your growing professional specialist knowledge can inform your decision-making and analysis.\n\n The module will also explore important and contemporary topics in real estate investment, and you will be challenged to think about areas such as how sustainability is shifting the investment landscape, and how behaviours can affect decision-making and investment outcomes. The module will allow you to develop skills in combining your real estate investment knowledge and analytical skills in a professional report responding to a client-based portfolio management task.\n\n \n\nThe aims of the module are to:\n\n1.       Introduce and explore the characteristics of real estate and the opportunities and risks this provides.\n\n2.       Examine how investment theories can guide decision-making.\n\n3.       Enable development of digital numeracy skills and the application of these to data analysis and portfolio management scenarios.\n\n4.       Encourage skills in professional report writing and provision of evidenced recommendations for portfolio management.\n15 credits\n\n\nEmployability and Professional Skills\n\n\nAs professional skills become increasingly vital for workplace success, this module will allow you to develop a range of supporting skills that will enhance your learning experience at Sheffield and prepare you for a successful career. \n\nThe module has two elements: 1. Cultures of Learning and Professional Skills - understanding how we teach at Sheffield, how to get the most out of your study and how to develop key generic professional/soft skills 2. Employability Skills - preparing you for careers within planning, design, real estate, GIS and related professional areas.\n\n\n\nThe aims of this  module are: \n\n1. to provide a range of supporting skills for home and international students, which will help you get the most out of your learning in Sheffield\n\n2. to prepare you for professional employment and career development at the end of your studies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second semester focuses on the development, application and integration of knowledge and skills.\n\n\n\n Core modules:\n\n\nInvestment Valuation\n\n\nThis module builds on the principles of valuation introduced in the Autumn Semester. It focuses on the valuation of office, retail and industrial real estate, together comprising the most common type of commercial real estate, dominating the landscape of the built environment. The investment method of valuation, introduced in 'Applied Real Estate Valuation', is revisited and the basic principles are extended to allow a more advanced analysis of value. This is important as client requirements increasingly diverge with respect to investment criteria, and as economic and sustainability contexts shift.\n\n \n\nIn this module you are introduced to the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) approach to real estate valuation, an approach increasingly important for members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and offering transparency for clients and sensitivity and scenario analysis in the light of future uncertainties. Each week you will participate in interactive lectures where principles are introduced and explained through the use of client-focused scenarios, and you will have the opportunity to develop your knowledge and skills in DCF, supported by weekly tutorials. This module is based on developing DCF spreadsheets using excel, enabling you to develop employability skills in the areas of digital numeracy and commercial awareness. This approach explicitly places valuation within economic and political contexts, allowing scenarios to be explored as these wider contexts shift. You will be able to learn how to respond to different scenarios and client requirements. For example, you will see how DCF can be effectively used to assess the viability of improving the sustainability of real estate and how to respond and provide strategic advice to clients in the light of the challenges this brings. You will be guided through how to provide advice to clients considering purchasing real estate and how opportunities can be evaluated against target rates of return. Using feedback provided during 'Applied Real Estate Valuation' in the first semester, in this second semester module you will be able to deepen your skills in preparing and presenting a client-focused professional valuation report.\n\n \n\nThe aims of the module are to:\n\n1.       Enable you to develop skills in developing and using DCF valuation techniques in response to client requirements.\n\n2.       Reflect on the basic valuation inputs and extend the analysis to better reflect asset characteristics and economic contexts.\n\n3.       Allow you to deepen your skills in carrying out and presenting valuation work with regard to the highest professional and ethical standards.\n15 credits\n\n\nProperty Law\n\n\nManaging real estate assets is fundamental to their successful operation and ongoing viability. It is therefore core to the success of places and resilience in the built environment. Yet the complexities and legal systems involved in this management is little understood by many professionals involved in safeguarding the future of places. The liabilities of real estate owners and occupiers underpin the investment performance of real estate assets and in this module you will be introduced to this fascinating area.\n\n \n\nYou will be able to learn about a range of important areas for real estate professionals, such as the property law issues that can prevent or restrict new developments, and the legal responsibilities for asset managers, and how these issues can impact on property values. You will get to study and understand how to avoid acting with professional negligence in your career, and how to recognise and appreciate legal rights and obligations, including of buyers, sellers, landlords and tenants. Lectures are used to set out different issues and will use examples and case law to illustrate problems that can occur and how to recognise and avoid these. You will be able to develop and deepen your understanding through supported tutorials, where you will be able to ask questions and practise responding to client-focused scenarios.\n\n \n\nThe aims of the module are to:\n\n1.       Illustrate the importance and complexities of property law in asset and place management.\n\n2.       Explain and use examples to show how statute and case law underpin legal obligations of real estate professionals.\n\n3.       Consider how property law relates to the broader legal and fiscal background and prevailing market conditions, and how this impacts on real estate.\n15 credits\n\n\nReal Estate Planning and Development Project\n\n\nReal estate development involves several interconnected factors such as land acquisition, design and planning consent, construction and marketing / disposal. It requires developers to make informed decisions based on multiple appraisals of market, planning, financial and risk factors. Planning in particular plays a crucial role in shaping real estate development projects. It provides a framework for decision making, can promote sustainable development and ensure development projects contribute positively to the built environment. At the same time, planning can also impose constraints that can limit the scope and nature of projects. Studying the real estate development process will enhance your ability to analyse complex problems, develop effective solutions, and learn valuable decision-making skills.  \n\nThe module builds upon the principles of land and development introduced in the Autumn semester. It focuses on the interrelationship between real estate development and spatial planning and explores the main aspects of development appraisal.  You will work towards producing an assessment of the planning potential and viability considerations for a real-world development site in an integrated way that fully accounts for the relevant institutional and legal frameworks. The module therefore includes coverage of: market research, planning appraisal, financial appraisal (including financial appraisal using residual and cash-flow methods), sustainability considerations, sources and methods of development finance, sources and management of risk and uncertainty; and the influence of the planning system on real estate development and investment.\n\nThe aims of the module are to:\n\n- Enable you to assess development potential and understand the various influences upon it, including planning policy and design considerations\n\n- Allow you to develop a solution that offers the greatest likelihood of a successful outcome \n\n- Develop your appreciation of the theoretical and practical justification of the solution\n\n- Allow you to deepen your skills in project management, development appraisal, financial analysis and the clear presentation of complex information in professional business report form\n15 credits\n\n\nInnovation and Digital Transformation\n\n\nThe real estate profession is changing and in recent decades, real estate use, operations and service have evolved significantly as a result of demographic and socio-cultural changes and the advancement of digital technology. This module will introduce you to a wide range of innovative systems, digital tools and platforms that underpin contemporary real estate use and services. You will also be able to develop soft employability skills such as creativity, entrepreneurship, teamworking, collaboration and problem-solving. \n\nThe module allows you to understand the links between various segments of the real estate value chain and to appreciate the environmental, social, economic and physical (ESEP) inefficiencies and challenges within the sector. You will be introduced to a wide range of advanced digital tools such as Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, blockchain, virtual reality and drones and you will be able to learn about how these tools are creating a new ecosystem of digital technology within the real estate sector (commonly referred to as PropTech). You will also be challenged to critically reflect on existing innovative systems and digital tools within the real estate sector and to identify opportunities for more effective and efficient systems and approaches. The module will also introduce you to emerging concepts such as the sharing economy and operational real estate which have developed in the last couple of decades. Your learning will be supported by case study analysis, group discussions, workshops and guest presentations from industry experts.\n\nLearning will be delivered through a combination of problem-oriented, collaborative and project-based learning approaches which will enable you to develop skills such as creativity, communication, strategic thinking, entrepreneurship, teamwork and problem solving.  \n\nThe aims of the module are to: \n\nIntroduce you to the full spectrum of the real estate value chain and the links between them; \n\nExplore the emerging areas of real estate practice and their roles and functions in real estate markets;\n\nExplore the various environmental, social, economic and physical inefficiencies and challenges within the built environment sector and demonstrate the role of innovation and digital technology in addressing them;\n\nSupport you to develop problem-solving, innovative, and creative skills that can enable various dimensions of solutions to a wide range of challenges in the built environment industry.\n15 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will complete your dissertation over the summer.\n\n\n\n Core module:\n\n\nReal Estate Research Project\n\n\nThis core module is a major research project that offers you the opportunity to develop and manage an individual empirical research project of specialist surveying concern. During the module, you will get the opportunity to develop and apply research skills and develop an appreciation of the issues involved in managing a real estate research project, which may include sourcing and analysing property data in a research context. You will have the opportunity to gain experience in the key stages of undertaking a research project, including identifying a topic; conducting a review of existing knowledge; identifying research questions; selecting methods; designing and conducting a project of specialist surveying concern; and presenting the outcome of the project in a logical and coherent written format. In taking this module, you will be able to deepen your knowledge and experience of conducting research in an area of specialist surveying concern. \n\nThe module aims to give you the opportunity to experience conducting an original research project with supervisory guidance. More specifically, it aims to:\n\n- Enable you to develop skills in topic selection and refinement; research design skills and project management;\n\n- Let you develop an understanding of the role of research in relation to theoretical and practical dimensions of the surveying discipline;\n\n- Allow you to further and deepen knowledge in a chosen field of specialist surveying concern;\n\n- Offer you the opportunity to build on knowledge of specific research methods and analytical techniques and develop skills in independent research.\n60 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content of our courses is reviewed annually to make sure it's up-to-date and relevant.

You will be guided through how to provide advice to clients considering purchasing real estate and how opportunities can be evaluated against target rates of return. Using feedback provided during 'Applied Real Estate Valuation' in the first semester, in this second semester module you will be able to deepen your skills in preparing and presenting a client-focused professional valuation report.\n\n \n\nThe aims of the module are to:\n\n1.       Enable you to develop skills in developing and using DCF valuation techniques in response to client requirements.\n\n2.       Reflect on the basic valuation inputs and extend the analysis to better reflect asset characteristics and economic contexts.\n\n3.       Allow you to deepen your skills in carrying out and presenting valuation work with regard to the highest professional and ethical standards.\n15 credits\nProperty Law: Managing real estate assets is fundamental to their successful operation and ongoing viability. It is therefore core to the success of places and resilience in the built environment. Yet the complexities and legal systems involved in this management is little understood by many professionals involved in safeguarding the future of places. The liabilities of real estate owners and occupiers underpin the investment performance of real estate assets and in this module you will be introduced to this fascinating area.\n\n \n\nYou will be able to learn about a range of important areas for real estate professionals, such as the property law issues that can prevent or restrict new developments, and the legal responsibilities for asset managers, and how these issues can impact on property values. You will get to study and understand how to avoid acting with professional negligence in your career, and how to recognise and appreciate legal rights and obligations, including of buyers, sellers, landlords and tenants. Lectures are used to set out different issues and will use examples and case law to illustrate problems that can occur and how to recognise and avoid these. You will be able to develop and deepen your understanding through supported tutorials, where you will be able to ask questions and practise responding to client-focused scenarios.\n\n \n\nThe aims of the module are to:\n\n1.       Illustrate the importance and complexities of property law in asset and place management.\n\n2.       Explain and use examples to show how statute and case law underpin legal obligations of real estate professionals.\n\n3.       Consider how property law relates to the broader legal and fiscal background and prevailing market conditions, and how this impacts on real estate.\n15 credits\nReal Estate Planning and Development Project: Real estate development involves several interconnected factors such as land acquisition, design and planning consent, construction and marketing / disposal. It requires developers to make informed decisions based on multiple appraisals of market, planning, financial and risk factors. Planning in particular plays a crucial role in shaping real estate development projects. It provides a framework for decision making, can promote sustainable development and ensure development projects contribute positively to the built environment. At the same time, planning can also impose constraints that can limit the scope and nature of projects. Studying the real estate development process will enhance your ability to analyse complex problems, develop effective solutions, and learn valuable decision-making skills.  \n\nThe module builds upon the principles of land and development introduced in the Autumn semester. It focuses on the interrelationship between real estate development and spatial planning and explores the main aspects of development appraisal.  You will work towards producing an assessment of the planning potential and viability considerations for a real-world development site in an integrated way that fully accounts for the relevant institutional and legal frameworks. The module therefore includes coverage of: market research, planning appraisal, financial appraisal (including financial appraisal using residual and cash-flow methods), sustainability considerations, sources and methods of development finance, sources and management of risk and uncertainty; and the influence of the planning system on real estate development and investment.\n\nThe aims of the module are to:\n\n- Enable you to assess development potential and understand the various influences upon it, including planning policy and design considerations\n\n- Allow you to develop a solution that offers the greatest likelihood of a successful outcome \n\n- Develop your appreciation of the theoretical and practical justification of the solution\n\n- Allow you to deepen your skills in project management, development appraisal, financial analysis and the clear presentation of complex information in professional business report form\n15 credits\nInnovation and Digital Transformation: The real estate profession is changing and in recent decades, real estate use, operations and service have evolved significantly as a result of demographic and socio-cultural changes and the advancement of digital technology.

It focuses on the valuation of office, retail and industrial real estate, together comprising the most common type of commercial real estate, dominating the landscape of the built environment. The investment method of valuation, introduced in 'Applied Real Estate Valuation', is revisited and the basic principles are extended to allow a more advanced analysis of value. This is important as client requirements increasingly diverge with respect to investment criteria, and as economic and sustainability contexts shift.\n\n \n\nIn this module you are introduced to the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) approach to real estate valuation, an approach increasingly important for members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and offering transparency for clients and sensitivity and scenario analysis in the light of future uncertainties. Each week you will participate in interactive lectures where principles are introduced and explained through the use of client-focused scenarios, and you will have the opportunity to develop your knowledge and skills in DCF, supported by weekly tutorials. This module is based on developing DCF spreadsheets using excel, enabling you to develop employability skills in the areas of digital numeracy and commercial awareness. This approach explicitly places valuation within economic and political contexts, allowing scenarios to be explored as these wider contexts shift. You will be able to learn how to respond to different scenarios and client requirements. For example, you will see how DCF can be effectively used to assess the viability of improving the sustainability of real estate and how to respond and provide strategic advice to clients in the light of the challenges this brings. You will be guided through how to provide advice to clients considering purchasing real estate and how opportunities can be evaluated against target rates of return.

I found the projects they were working on to be interesting, and I was surprised at the wide range of roles that exist within the industry. Knowing that I wanted to pursue a career in the world of real estate, I began searching for a course that would enable me to gain an in depth understanding of the variety of roles available within the industry.\nLooking back, I can certainly say that this masters has given me the in depth introduction to the sector that I was looking for. The course is clearly designed to give you a thorough understanding of valuation, investment valuation, economics, planning, landlord and tenant law, and development. Throughout my year at the University of Sheffield, teaching took a variety of forms. We participated in group projects, workshops, lectures, and were introduced to many Sheffield-based buildings and case-studies.\nUltimately, what sets the University of Sheffield’s course apart from others, is the support you receive. The lecturers are approachable and willing to give you the support you need, whether that be to help you understand a certain concept or plan your dissertation.\nSince graduating, I have started work as a Graduate Surveyor, within a commercial real estate advisory firm, and the course material prepared me for the work I am currently doing. As the course assignments mimicked real-life scenarios and reporting, I entered the workforce with a degree of confidence, that I would be able to carry out the work asked of me.

It can take longer at busy times.If you haven't received a decision on your application after eight weeks, we recommend that you contact the academic department directly. You can find their contact details via our find a PhD webpage.Before we make our decision, we may invite you to attend an interview with staff from your academic department. You can find information on what to expect in an interview in our guidance:InterviewsWhen we've made our decisionWhen we've made our decision, it will appear in your online application, and we'll also send you an email to confirm this.If we've offered you a study place, we'll provide you with an official electronic offer letter detailing any conditions and the amount payable for the tuition fees. The offer letter will be attached to our email and also available for you to download from your online application.If we haven't offered you a study place and you would like feedback on this decision, you should contact the academic department directly in writing.Offer typesIf we make you an offer, it will be either Conditional or Unconditional.A Conditional offer means there are requirements that you need to meet before you can start the course, for example a certain English language score, or a minimum grade in your current studies.An Unconditional offer means there are no further academic requirements that you need to meet.Conditional offersIf we've made you a Conditional offer, the conditions will be stated in your offer letter. When you've met these conditions, you should upload to your online application documents that prove it. When you've met all the conditions of your offer, we'll provide you with a new, Unconditional offer letter.The standard deadlines for meeting the conditions of an offer are provided on our key dates and deadlines page.If you have any problems attaching documents to your online application, please contact us.Calculating average final marks for International studentsWe normally determine the final mark of an international degree by calculating the average of all the module marks, weighted by credit value. For module marks assigned as a range, we use the mid-point of the range. Note that the average we calculate may differ from the average shown on your transcript.Unconditional offersAn Unconditional offer has no conditions. You just need to let us know whether or not you want to accept or decline our offer of a study place.Replying to your offerIn most cases, you can accept or decline the offer of a study place via your online application.

However, we encourage applicants to make a decision within three months of receiving an offer. Also, the sooner you accept an offer, the sooner you'll be able to make other arrangements (for example your accommodation or visa).You can accept only one Unconditional offer of a place. If you've received Unconditional offers for more than one course, you'll need to choose which course to accept. You should then decline the other offers.Withdrawing your applicationIf you want to withdraw from the application process, please contact us. We'll then update your application record.DeferralsIf we've offered you a study place and for unforeseen circumstances you can't attend at the start of your course, you can ask to defer your entry.You can request a deferral through your original online application, by clicking on the 'Request Deferral' link in the 'Your Applications' section.

You may wish to add admissions@sheffield.ac.uk to your address book to avoid important messages being marked as spam.\nIf you change your email address, please let us know by emailing us at admissions@sheffield.ac.uk, including your full name and applicant number.\nFor most taught courses, it normally takes academic departments around four weeks to make decisions on applications. It can take longer at busy times.\nFor some of our courses, we may invite you to attend an interview with staff from your academic department. You can find information on what to expect in an interview in our guidance:\nWhen we've made our decision, it will appear in your online application, and we'll also send you an email to confirm this.\nIf we've offered you a study place, we'll provide you with an official electronic offer letter detailing any conditions and the amount payable for the tuition fees. The offer letter will be attached to our email and also available for you to download from your online application.\nIf we haven't offered you a study place and you would like feedback on this decision, you should contact the academic department directly in writing. You can find their contact details under the relevant entry in our postgraduate taught course listings.\nIf we make you an offer, it will be either Conditional or Unconditional.\nA Conditional offer means that there are requirements that you need to meet before you can start the course, for example a certain English language score, or a minimum grade in your current studies.\nAn Unconditional offer means that there are no further academic requirements that you need to meet.\nIf we've made you a Conditional offer, the conditions will be stated in your offer letter. When you've met these conditions, you should upload to your online application documents that prove it. When you've met all the conditions of your offer, we'll provide you with a new, Unconditional offer letter.\nThe standard deadlines for meeting the conditions of your offer are provided on our key dates and deadlines page. A few courses use different deadlines. If this is the case for your course, it will be indicated in your offer letter.\nIf you have any problems attaching documents to your online application, please contact us.\nWe normally determine the final mark of an international degree by calculating the average of all the module marks, weighted by credit value. For module marks assigned as a range, we use the mid-point of the range. Note that the average we calculate may differ from the average shown on your transcript.\nAn Unconditional offer has no conditions. You just need to let us know whether or not you want to accept or decline our offer of a study place.\nIn most cases, you can accept or decline the offer of a study place via your online application. If you're not able to do this, please let us know your decision by emailing us at admissions@sheffield.ac.uk. When you accept an offer, you also accept our Terms and Conditions upon Acceptance of an Offer.\nExcept where indicated in the offer letter, there are no specific deadlines for accepting an offer. However, we encourage applicants to make a decision within three months of receiving an offer. Also, the sooner you accept an offer, the sooner you'll be able to make other arrangements (for example your accommodation or visa).\nYou can accept only one Unconditional offer of a place. If you've received Unconditional offers for more than one course, you'll need to choose which course to accept. You should then decline the other offers.\nIf you're an International applicant, we'll normally ask you to pay a deposit on your tuition fee after you accept an Unconditional offer. We'll tell you more about this, including how you can pay, in your Unconditional offer letter.\nTuition fee deposits\nIf you want to withdraw from the application process, please contact us. We'll then update your application record.\nIf we've offered you a study place and you will be unable to attend at the start of your course, you may be able to defer your entry to the next admission point. Most postgraduate taught courses have one admission per year, at the start of the autumn semester in September/October.\nFor most courses, you can request a deferral through your original online application by clicking on the 'Request Deferral' link in the 'Your Applications' section. Requesting a deferral will deactivate your current offer, so you should only request one when you're sure that you can't start on the original start date. If you aren't sure, we would advise you to submit a new application for the next admission point, when applications open for that year.\nIf the academic selectors approve your request, we'll send you an amended offer letter with a deferred start date.\nYou should submit your deferral request by the deadline published on our key dates webpage. You can defer your application a maximum of two times. If want to defer for a third time, we'll ask you to re-apply.\nDeferral requests are reviewed by our admissions selectors, then we'll let you know the decision. Please note that we can't always review deferral requests when we receive them, and we can't issue deferred offers until after the new admissions year has begun, usually in September. We'll acknowledge receipt of your request within two weeks.\nUniversity of Sheffield offer-holders are entitled to access the members area of our website, MUSE (My University of Sheffield Environment). Using MUSE is the easiest way to book to attend departmental open days, apply for University accommodation and scholarships and, when the time comes, complete pre-registration tasks.\nAfter we've issued your offer, we'll email you with a username and invite you to activate your account. More information is available on our webpages:\nMUSE for offer-holders\nWhen you have accepted your Conditional or Unconditional offer, you can apply online for University accommodation.
