The Real Estate Business and Professional Practice Module has a strong emphasis on personal and professional development with a twin focus on business and professional values and contemporary real estate business and practice.\nThis module enables students to develop understanding of the financial, technical and market context of the appraisal of investments in general and the appraisal of real estate in particular.\nThe aim of this module is to introduce students to basic concepts of finance to be used within the context of investment appraisal of assets and real estate in particular. Students will be able to extract information from company accounts and to understand how the investment and financing decisions can be separated. They will be able to apply and critically evaluate different techniques for the pricing of investments. The module will enable students to understand the decision to invest in any real estate project using a rigorous and consistent framework.\nThe aim of this module is to develop the students’ understanding of the real estate business and professional practice. It places a significant emphasis on developing the students commercial awareness of the sector, its key players and the wider environment within which it operates. The module has two principal areas of focus: (i) understanding the relevance of contemporary business and professional values to professional practice in the real estate sector and (ii) developing commercial awareness through classroom based lectures- seminars and through engagement with a variety of curricular and extra-curricular activities including field work, visiting speaker seminars and workshops on professional development.\nThis module covers the economic principles underlying urban and rural economics, planning, and real estate commercial and residential markets.\nThe initial focus of the second semester is on specialised knowledge with students choosing three 20 credit electives from three baskets of options. The compulsory Real Estate Opportunities Module is a capstone module focused on the integration and application of core and specialised skills towards the end of the semester.\nStudents must choose either REMF67 Independent Study (20 credits) or REMDISS Real Estate and Planning Dissertation (40 credits) as their project module.\nStudents taking the Independent Study must pick 60 credits of modules, one module from each basket; students taking the dissertation must pick 40 credits of modules, one module from 2 baskets.\nThe aim of this ‘capstone’ module is to integrate and apply both core and specialised knowledge obtained in the MSc Real Estate or MSc Real Estate Finance Programmes and to demonstrate originality in the understanding and systematic application of this knowledge. Students work as part of team to complete three group assignments related to an International Field Trip, an Industry Challenge and a Real Estate Strategy Game. The module has a strong emphasis on ‘experiential’ learning.\nThe aim of this module is to integrate and apply both core and specialised knowledge obtained in the MSc Real Estate Programme and to demonstrate originality in the understanding and systematic application of this knowledge.\nThe Real Estate and Planning Dissertation module provides a vehicle for an in-depth understanding of a chosen area of real estate economics, real estate finance and investment practice. Depending on the student's interest, this independent study requires students to select a relevant topic or issue in their programme area for further research and analysis. They will also be specifically required to display academic rigour in carrying out an agreed research programme, in presenting findings, and in producing a high quality, fully referenced dissertation that is supported by appropriate quantitative, qualitative and/or illustrative data.\nThis module builds on the REMF60 Real Estate Investment Appraisal module and studies the market valuation process; as distinct from the wider appraisal process. It examines both the valuation process and valuation methods, as well as preparing students for the workplace, it critically examines property valuation practice at both a theoretical and applied level.\nThe module aims to provide students with an understanding of: the nature of the real estate development process including the activities, agencies, events, relationships, skills and tasks involved; the factors which influence the process and its outcomes; and the types, characteristics, utility and quality of buildings and schemes. The module also explores the methodologies involved in the appraisal and financing of development projects.\nThis module aims to provide students with knowledge of market structures and the pricing of financial products available for indirect investments in real estate, in order to develop a critical understanding of the different features of real estate securities. It challenges the implications that specific characteristics of private real estate assets have on the pricing of such securities.\nInvestment in rural land and property has been a significant element of the UK countryside for generations but the sector is seeing substantial change, with traditional family and institutional owners being joined by new investors, whether for individual or corporate investment.\nRural property has been seen as a conservative but safe asset, often demonstrating contra-cyclical performance, and thus attracting investors seeking to balance more speculative asset classes in their portfolios. Traditionally agriculture has been the focus of this investment, but emerging markets are gaining ground in the rural sector, particularly in terms of natural capital and ecosystem services.\nThose operating in this sphere need to demonstrate technical knowledge in various areas, from an understanding of the core influences on rural land as an asset class to the ability to analyse and project long-term financial performance. The purpose of the module is intended to introduce students, including those who wish to make a career in the rural sector, to the range of financial, economic and asset management skills required to offer strategic advice in this area.\nHistoric buildings and sites are a major part of the built environment. Many will be hundreds of years old, but there are also more modern buildings considered as heritage. The construction industry’s work is evenly split between new-build and work to existing buildings, some of which will have some statutory protection, such as being listed.\nThe module is about understanding how commercial real estate markets work in an international context. It covers three distinct, but interrelated areas - topics in international market analysis - analysis of European real estate markets - introduction to global market analysis. The module aims to provide the student with a comprehensive understanding of the key issues in and approaches to the analysis of commercial real estate markets in an international context. It critically evaluates the functioning and principal characteristics of commercial real estate markets, key global players and the real estate sectors in both established and emerging markets.\nThis module is designed to help students develop a conceptual and practical understanding of the legal environment in which real estate operates in England and Wales.\nThere is an ongoing and critical role for planning to help address environmental and climate change-related issues globally and locally. Environmental planning has developed as an important policy field in its own right, it is closely intertwined with spatial planning more generally and features its own rationalities, types of knowledge and skills. Spatial planning policy and practice can facilitate efficient land use, prescribe environmentally friendly types of construction and sustainable mobility, and, crucially, make places more adaptable and resilient to impacts from climate change. The module provides students with an understanding of the range of issues and tools deployed to address environmental planning challenges using a blend of theory and practice-based examples.\nAn understanding of rural property law and valuation is key for property consultants working in the rural sector. This module is designed to help prepare students for providing advice on rural landlord and tenant law and valuation issues in professional practice. It is largely based on the law as applied to property in England and Wales, although content on the differing statutory codes in Scotland and Northern Ireland is included, where relevant.\nThe Real Estate Asset Management – REMF44 module explores the real estate management process; it is evaluated from the perspective of both investors and public/corporate occupiers. The students will be able to apply qualitative and quantitative techniques to analyse the real estate management process and thus make a better judgment on investment and tenure opportunities. Underpinning the module is the application of practical tools and conceptual understanding of the real estate management business.\nThis module aims to enable students to develop and deepen their understanding of the concepts of investment strategy, portfolio selection and performance measurement and their application to property markets. It also aims to further develop students' analytic capacity. Upon completion of the module, students should have an understanding of key theoretical concepts in investment strategy, be able to appraise critically published work in the field and apply this knowledge to the analysis of practical real estate problems.\nThis module will provide students with an awareness of the economic principles that underpin residential property markets and relevant government policies.\nHousing has always been a fundamental basis for human life. Recently though, it has also grown to become the world’s largest asset class, powered by three decades of rapid global house price inflation. What happens in housing markets therefore affects almost everything; from financial market stability, to wealth inequalities; from national productivity, to rates of child birth.\nThis module focuses on developing a conceptual understanding of sustainable development principles and their applications in real estate markets. The focus is on the adoption of sustainability and ESG in the UK property industry throughout real estate life cycles, including how this is relevant to and manifests itself at various life cycle stages, i.e. development, design, construction, operation, refurbishment, retrofitting and regeneration. The module also focuses on drivers and barriers for the adoption of sustainable development principles for a range of stakeholders in the property industry, including the business case for sustainability and building resilience.\nThis module is designed to provide a theoretical and practical understanding of urban regeneration. It will focus on the relationship between the economic, social, environmental and political forces shaping approaches to urban regeneration, offering an overview of the evolution of urban regeneration policy and practice, with a focus on the UK context.\nModules or course content marked as optional are indicative and may be subject to change.

Traditionally agriculture has been the focus of this investment, but emerging markets are gaining ground in the rural sector, particularly in terms of natural capital and ecosystem services. \nThose operating in this sphere need to demonstrate technical knowledge in various areas, from an understanding of the core influences on rural land as an asset class to the ability to analyse and project long-term financial performance. The purpose of the module is intended to introduce students, including those who wish to make a career in the rural sector, to the range of financial, economic and asset management skills required to offer strategic advice in this area. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcademic authors\nAngela Cropley\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcademic authors\nNicholas Millard\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n      More info\nAcademic authors\nAngela Cropley\nAcademic authors\nNicholas Millard\nMore info\nHeritage and Development\n                                  (REMF59)\n                            \n\n                20 [10 ECTS credits]\n              \n\n\nHistoric buildings and sites are a major part of the built environment.

Environmental planning has developed as an important policy field in its own right, it is closely intertwined with spatial planning more generally and features its own rationalities, types of knowledge and skills. Spatial planning policy and practice can facilitate efficient land use, prescribe environmentally friendly types of construction and sustainable mobility, and, crucially, make places more adaptable and resilient to impacts from climate change. The module provides students with an understanding of the range of issues and tools deployed to address environmental planning challenges using a blend of theory and practice-based examples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcademic authors\nGavin Parker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcademic authors\nChristopher Maidment\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n      More info\nAcademic authors\nGavin Parker\nAcademic authors\nChristopher Maidment\nMore info\nRural Property Law and Valuation\n                                  (REMRPLV)\n                            \n\n                20 [10 ECTS credits]\n              \n\n\nAn understanding of rural property law and valuation is key for property consultants working in the rural sector.

It can also be used as an introduction for those intending to continue with further study on the programme.\nThe supported e-learning format enables participants to manage their study time efficiently and with flexibility, at distance.\nThis module presents concepts of real estate finance, both theoretically and empirically. It can be seen as a course in corporate finance (funding and valuation) applied to real estate topics. It is particularly relevant for investment appraisal because it presents models to determine the discount rate in real estate investment decisions and it reconciles types of cash flows and discount rates to obtain investment values.\nThis module develops the theory and practice of appraisal for individual property investments, mainly in the context of the commercial and industrial real estate investment markets. It will consider different bases of value, different approaches to appraisal, required returns, yields, how cash flow is generated and how property investment relates to other asset markets.\nThis module aims to provide students with knowledge of market structures and the pricing of financial products available for indirect investments in real estate, in order to develop a critical understanding of the different features of real estate securities. It challenges the implications that specific characteristics of private real estate assets have on the pricing of such securities.\nThe module will present and analyse several sources of funding and their pricing. The process of raising equity for private real estate investment will be introduced and examined. As far as debt funding is concerned, alongside traditional methods (e.g. private lending and mortgages), the module will review structured products and hybrid forms of financing. Particular emphasis will be given to the implications of different funding structures on returns that are achieved or are achievable by equity investors.\nParticipants who successfully complete the face to face courses of the Investment Education Programme will receive the IPF Diploma from the Investment Property Forum.\nThis is an essential foundation property investment course for financial analysis and combines an introduction to basic property investment mathematics and statistics with applications to property valuation and portfolio management.\nYou will learn:\nThe course will also cover:\nBy the end of the course, you should be able to:\nSuitable for anyone wishing to improve their knowledge of financial mathematics or experience in finance and investment.\nPlease note that the content of this course focuses very much on mathematics, statistics and excel.

This new funding allows us to provide further financial support to high-potential applicants.\nIf you’re considering postgraduate study, now is a great time to apply!\nThere are two levels of scholarships awards available for 2025 entry - The Henley Business School Excellence Scholar and the Henley Business School Excellence Scholar – Dean’s List. The difference in the scholarships is reflected in the amount awarded as a tuition fee discount and the wording on the certificate that you receive.\nHome students: Henley Business School Excellence Scholars will be awarded £2,500. In exceptional cases a candidate may be selected for a Dean’s List award and allocated up to £5,000.\nInternational students: Henley Business School Excellence Scholars will typically be awarded between £3,000-£5,000 as a tuition fee waiver. Outstanding candidates selected for the Dean’s List will be allocated up to £10,000.\nScholarships are automatically awarded and consider several factors prioritising quality, based on an Admissions dept assessment of the application. The panel will also consider the World Bank PPP Conversion Factor to offer potentially higher amounts of funding to low- and middle- income countries to widen access to UK HE from countries with lower income levels. All scholarships are awarded as a reduction in tuition fees.\nAwarding commences in November and concludes in July. If you are successful, you will receive an email from the Henley Scholarships Team shortly after your offer. This typically takes up to two weeks but may take up to four weeks during busy periods.\n£970,000 awarded in four stages to reflect the application cycle and timings from different regions, with the goal of supporting a fair and equal distribution of awards. Any unclaimed allocation will be rolled forward to the next period.\nFull details will be provided in your scholarship award notification. You need to accept within four weeks of the award offer, and you will need pay a deposit to secure your place on your programme.\nAll applications will be treated separately, so if you hold offers for multiple programmes, each will be judged on its own merits. It is possible to receive a scholarship for more than one course.\nNo. Outstanding candidates can be recognised and rewarded with the Dean’s List awards.\nHenley Business School and/or University of Reading Alumni receive a 20% discount off tuition fees for 2025 entry, which is applied to the first year of tuition fees in the case of full-time students or split over two years for part-time students. The alumni discount can be combined with a scholarship. Eligible students will qualify automatically, so no additional application is needed.\nNo, you will automatically be contacted by email if you are awarded a scholarship. Your application remains eligible for a scholarship throughout the application process, so even if you are not awarded immediately your application will continue to be reviewed and considered and you will be automatically contacted if successful. We aim to get back to you as quickly as possible and ideally within four weeks. The time may be shorter (or longer) depending on the volume of applications received.\nPlease note that scholarship application is via the University of Reading applicant hub once an offer has been made. You can only apply when you have received an offer (conditional or unconditional). When you view your offer in the hub you will see the link to apply for scholarship(s) relevant to your offer. Find out more information on the AfRES Scholarship, including the application deadline and scholarship value.\nIf you have any questions, please contact us by email at postgraduate@henley.ac.uk or by phone on +44 (0)118 378 7593.\nThis site uses cookies to improve your user experience.

No separate scholarship application is needed unless it is for a specialist scholarship such as the AfRES Scholarship\n• You will be notified by email if your application is accepted for a scholarship. We aim to respond to those who have been awarded a scholarship within 4 weeks of receiving your offer to study – this may fluctuate depending on the point in the application cycle.\n• Only successful scholarship awardees will be notified.\n• If offered a scholarship, it must be accepted within 4 weeks of the scholarship offer date. After this deadline, scholarship offers will be withdrawn and reallocated.\n• Unclaimed scholarships funds will be reallocated, meaning that offer holders who did not receive a scholarship initially will be automatically reconsidered. So, if you did not receive a scholarship at the point of application, you are still eligible to receive a scholarship and will be notified automatically if you are subsequently awarded funds",
