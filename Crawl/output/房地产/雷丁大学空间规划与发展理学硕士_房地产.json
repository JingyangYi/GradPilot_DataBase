Moreover, you will also start your independent study (40 credits) that runs over the whole year.\nThis module covers the economic principles underlying urban and rural economics, planning, and real estate commercial and residential markets.\nThis module takes students through the process of preparing a policy framework, whilst exploring the application of planning theory to understand how this might influence the plan-making process. The module aims to instil core knowledges around planning theory and plan-making, within the context of understanding the different geographies for planning and the different stakeholders involved. These knowledges are integrated with the core professional skills of team-working and evidence gathering.\nThis module takes students through the initial stages of preparing a development proposal, from initial site observation and context analysis to proposal development in response to a client brief. The module aims to instil core knowledges for site planning and place-making, including sustainable urban design, integrated with key skills for professional practice, including observation, policy analysis, three-dimensional visualisation and creative synthesis. The module will enable students to develop a strong foundation in the knowledges, skills and attitudes necessary to respond creatively to a client brief, to prepare development proposals that respond to contemporary planning concerns to create well-designed places.\nThis module gives students the opportunity to carry out an in-depth Independent Study into a planning and development-related topic of their choice.\nThe first part of the module introduces students to the process of choosing and defining a research proposal, alongside developing core academic and professional skills. The second part of the module introduces research philosophies and methods in both qualitative and quantitative methods. A field trip to a European city will give students the opportunity to apply these research methods in a controlled environment. During the summer period students will draw on their learning and secondary data collection to develop their in-depth Independent Study, supported by a programme of group supervisory tutorials.\nThe focus of the second semester is on fostering more in-depth core knowledge in Planning and Development (40 credits), as well as acquiring specialised knowledge and skills in an area of interest, through the selection of two further modules (one from each basket, 40 credits) and the completion of an independent study, which includes a field trip component.\nExamples of specialised areas are as follows:\n•\tEnvironment (Environmental Planning and Policy; Sustainability and Real Estate)\n•\tDevelopment (Heritage and Development; Urban Regeneration)\n•\tPlanning (Comparative International Planning Studies; Housing Markets and Policy)\n•\tRural (Rural Property Law and Valuation; Sustainability and Real Estate)\nThrough this module students will analyse a site specific scenario, assessing it within the context of planning law, regulation and policy and exploring its implications for different stakeholders. The module aims to instil core knowledges around professionalism, ethics and planning law, complimented by guest lectures addressing contemporary issues in spatial planning. These knowledges are integrated with the core professional skills of negotiation and professional judgement.\nTaking the module will enable students to develop a strong foundation in the knowledges, skills and attitudes necessary to assess individual planning proposals, whilst taking account of how they are influenced by stakeholder relationships, policy and legal frameworks.\nThis module takes students through the process of appraising a development proposal, in the context of real estate development theories and processes. The module aims to instil core knowledges for real estate development, including theories of real estate development, integrated with key skills for professional practice, including appraising the viability of a development proposal and reflecting on the influence of financial considerations alongside issues such as sustainability and high-quality design. Additionally, the module introduces students to the principles of working with a client.\nThe aim of this module is to compare planning practices and systems worldwide and draw lessons from such comparisons. The module will enable students to appreciate and critique different systems of planning as well as compare planning systems. It sets the context, history and development of planning in a given country, region or state and then explores that system through particular issues/themes/techniques (e.g.: housing, community planning, zoning, etc.) associated with planning. The module thus provides an opportunity to develop a global view of how planning is practised, and the advantages and problems of different planning systems set against their political, economic, social and cultural context. By also discussing different themes in planning, the module allows for an appreciation of the versatility of planning in contributing to resolving various economic, social, environmental and cultural issues.\nHistoric buildings and sites are a major part of the built environment. Many will be hundreds of years old, but there are also more modern buildings considered as heritage. The construction industry’s work is evenly split between new-build and work to existing buildings, some of which will have some statutory protection, such as being listed.\nThere is an ongoing and critical role for planning to help address environmental and climate change-related issues globally and locally. Environmental planning has developed as an important policy field in its own right, it is closely intertwined with spatial planning more generally and features its own rationalities, types of knowledge and skills. Spatial planning policy and practice can facilitate efficient land use, prescribe environmentally friendly types of construction and sustainable mobility, and, crucially, make places more adaptable and resilient to impacts from climate change. The module provides students with an understanding of the range of issues and tools deployed to address environmental planning challenges using a blend of theory and practice-based examples.\nThis module is designed to provide a theoretical and practical understanding of urban regeneration. It will focus on the relationship between the economic, social, environmental and political forces shaping approaches to urban regeneration, offering an overview of the evolution of urban regeneration policy and practice, with a focus on the UK context.\nThis module will provide students with an awareness of the economic principles that underpin residential property markets and relevant government policies.\nHousing has always been a fundamental basis for human life. Recently though, it has also grown to become the world’s largest asset class, powered by three decades of rapid global house price inflation. What happens in housing markets therefore affects almost everything; from financial market stability, to wealth inequalities; from national productivity, to rates of child birth.\nThis module focuses on developing a conceptual understanding of sustainable development principles and their applications in real estate markets. The focus is on the adoption of sustainability and ESG in the UK property industry throughout real estate life cycles, including how this is relevant to and manifests itself at various life cycle stages, i.e. development, design, construction, operation, refurbishment, retrofitting and regeneration. The module also focuses on drivers and barriers for the adoption of sustainable development principles for a range of stakeholders in the property industry, including the business case for sustainability and building resilience.\nInvestment in rural land and property has been a significant element of the UK countryside for generations but the sector is seeing substantial change, with traditional family and institutional owners being joined by new investors, whether for individual or corporate investment.\nRural property has been seen as a conservative but safe asset, often demonstrating contra-cyclical performance, and thus attracting investors seeking to balance more speculative asset classes in their portfolios. Traditionally agriculture has been the focus of this investment, but emerging markets are gaining ground in the rural sector, particularly in terms of natural capital and ecosystem services.\nThose operating in this sphere need to demonstrate technical knowledge in various areas, from an understanding of the core influences on rural land as an asset class to the ability to analyse and project long-term financial performance. The purpose of the module is intended to introduce students, including those who wish to make a career in the rural sector, to the range of financial, economic and asset management skills required to offer strategic advice in this area.\nPart-time students will be enrolled with us for two years and, in each year of their study, they will take three compulsory modules and one optional module:\nModules or course content marked as optional are indicative and may be subject to change. Please note, constraints in timetable scheduling may mean you are unable to take some optional modules at the same time as others.\nWe continue to offer partial scholarships for the course, based on academic merit.

During the summer period students will draw on their learning and secondary data collection to develop their in-depth Independent Study, supported by a programme of group supervisory tutorials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcademic authors\nChristopher Maidment\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n      More info\nAcademic authors\nChristopher Maidment\nMore info\nThe focus of the second semester is on fostering more in-depth core knowledge in Planning and Development (40 credits), as well as acquiring specialised knowledge and skills in an area of interest, through the selection of two further modules (one from each basket, 40 credits) and the completion of an independent study, which includes a field trip component.\nExamples of specialised areas are as follows:\n•\tEnvironment (Environmental Planning and Policy; Sustainability and Real Estate)\n•\tDevelopment (Heritage and Development; Urban Regeneration)\n•\tPlanning (Comparative International Planning Studies; Housing Markets and Policy)\n•\tRural (Rural Property Law and Valuation; Sustainability and Real Estate)\nPlanning 2 - Law, Negotiation and Ethics\n                                  (REMP57)\n                            \n\n                20 [10 ECTS credits]\n              \n\n\nThrough this module students will analyse a site specific scenario, assessing it within the context of planning law, regulation and policy and exploring its implications for different stakeholders. The module aims to instil core knowledges around professionalism, ethics and planning law, complimented by guest lectures addressing contemporary issues in spatial planning. These knowledges are integrated with the core professional skills of negotiation and professional judgement.\nTaking the module will enable students to develop a strong foundation in the knowledges, skills and attitudes necessary to assess individual planning proposals, whilst taking account of how they are influenced by stakeholder relationships, policy and legal frameworks. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcademic authors\nChristopher Maidment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcademic authors\nGavin Parker\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n      More info\nAcademic authors\nChristopher Maidment\nAcademic authors\nGavin Parker\nMore info\nDevelopment 2: Process and Viability\n                                  (REMP62)\n                            \n\n                20 [10 ECTS credits]\n              \n\n\nThis module takes students through the process of appraising a development proposal, in the context of real estate development theories and processes. The module aims to instil core knowledges for real estate development, including theories of real estate development, integrated with key skills for professional practice, including appraising the viability of a development proposal and reflecting on the influence of financial considerations alongside issues such as sustainability and high-quality design. Additionally, the module introduces students to the principles of working with a client.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcademic authors\nClaudia Murray\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcademic authors\nZiyou Wang\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n      More info\nAcademic authors\nClaudia Murray\nAcademic authors\nZiyou Wang\nMore info\nComparative International Planning Studies\n                                  (REMP19)\n                            \n\n                20 [10 ECTS credits]\n              \n\n\nThe aim of this module is to compare planning practices and systems worldwide and draw lessons from such comparisons. The module will enable students to appreciate and critique different systems of planning as well as compare planning systems. It sets the context, history and development of planning in a given country, region or state and then explores that system through particular issues/themes/techniques (e.g.: housing, community planning, zoning, etc.) associated with planning. The module thus provides an opportunity to develop a global view of how planning is practised, and the advantages and problems of different planning systems set against their political, economic, social and cultural context. By also discussing different themes in planning, the module allows for an appreciation of the versatility of planning in contributing to resolving various economic, social, environmental and cultural issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcademic authors\nKaio Nogueira\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n      More info\nAcademic authors\nKaio Nogueira\nMore info\nHeritage and Development\n                                  (REMF59)\n                            \n\n                20 [10 ECTS credits]\n              \n\n\nHistoric buildings and sites are a major part of the built environment. Many will be hundreds of years old, but there are also more modern buildings considered as heritage.

Environmental planning has developed as an important policy field in its own right, it is closely intertwined with spatial planning more generally and features its own rationalities, types of knowledge and skills. Spatial planning policy and practice can facilitate efficient land use, prescribe environmentally friendly types of construction and sustainable mobility, and, crucially, make places more adaptable and resilient to impacts from climate change. The module provides students with an understanding of the range of issues and tools deployed to address environmental planning challenges using a blend of theory and practice-based examples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcademic authors\nGavin Parker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcademic authors\nChristopher Maidment\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n      More info\nAcademic authors\nGavin Parker\nAcademic authors\nChristopher Maidment\nMore info\nUrban Regeneration\n                                  (REMP34)\n                            \n\n                20 [10 ECTS credits]\n              \n\n\nThis module is designed to provide a theoretical and practical understanding of urban regeneration.

Recently though, it has also grown to become the world’s largest asset class, powered by three decades of rapid global house price inflation. What happens in housing markets therefore affects almost everything; from financial market stability, to wealth inequalities; from national productivity, to rates of child birth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcademic authors\nAlexandros Skouralis\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n      More info\nAcademic authors\nAlexandros Skouralis\nMore info\nSustainability and Real Estate\n                                  (REMF55)\n                            \n\n                20 [10 ECTS credits]\n              \n\n\nThis module focuses on developing a conceptual understanding of sustainable development principles and their applications in real estate markets. The focus is on the adoption of sustainability and ESG in the UK property industry throughout real estate life cycles, including how this is relevant to and manifests itself at various life cycle stages, i.e. development, design, construction, operation, refurbishment, retrofitting and regeneration. The module also focuses on drivers and barriers for the adoption of sustainable development principles for a range of stakeholders in the property industry, including the business case for sustainability and building resilience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcademic authors\nJorn van de Wetering\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n      More info\nAcademic authors\nJorn van de Wetering\nMore info\nInvestment in Rural Assets\n                                  (REMIRAS)\n                            \n\n                20 [10 ECTS credits]\n              \n\n\nInvestment in rural land and property has been a significant element of the UK countryside for generations but the sector is seeing substantial change, with traditional family and institutional owners being joined by new investors, whether for individual or corporate investment. \nRural property has been seen as a conservative but safe asset, often demonstrating contra-cyclical performance, and thus attracting investors seeking to balance more speculative asset classes in their portfolios. Traditionally agriculture has been the focus of this investment, but emerging markets are gaining ground in the rural sector, particularly in terms of natural capital and ecosystem services. \nThose operating in this sphere need to demonstrate technical knowledge in various areas, from an understanding of the core influences on rural land as an asset class to the ability to analyse and project long-term financial performance. The purpose of the module is intended to introduce students, including those who wish to make a career in the rural sector, to the range of financial, economic and asset management skills required to offer strategic advice in this area. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcademic authors\nAngela Cropley\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcademic authors\nNicholas Millard\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n      More info\nAcademic authors\nAngela Cropley\nAcademic authors\nNicholas Millard\nMore info\nHenley Business School Excellence Scholarships\nHenley Business School and Reading University Alumni Discount\nApply now\nView our Scholarships\nApply now\nView our scholarships\n[DEFINITION_LIST]\nLocation: Henley Whiteknights\n[DEFINITION_LIST]\nSubject area(s): Real Estate & Planning\n[DEFINITION_LIST]\nStart date: September 2025\n[DEFINITION_LIST]\nDuration: 12 months full-time, 24 months part-time\n[DEFINITION_LIST]\nAttendance: Full-time\n            ,\n                                  Part-time\n[DEFINITION_LIST]\nProgramme Director: Christopher Maidment\n[CARD]\nAcademic authors\nAcademic authors\nYi Wu\n[CARD]\nAcademic authors\nYi Wu\n[CARD]\nAcademic authors\n[CARD]\nYi Wu\n[CARD]\nAcademic authors\nAcademic authors\nGavin Parker\n[CARD]\nAcademic authors\nGavin Parker\n[CARD]\nAcademic authors\n[CARD]\nGavin Parker\n[CARD]\nAcademic authors\nAcademic authors\nAngelique Chettiparamb\n[CARD]\nAcademic authors\nAngelique Chettiparamb\n[CARD]\nAcademic authors\n[CARD]\nAngelique Chettiparamb\n[CARD]\nAcademic authors\nAcademic authors\nChristopher Maidment\n[CARD]\nAcademic authors\nChristopher Maidment\n[CARD]\nAcademic authors\n[CARD]\nChristopher Maidment\n[CARD]\nAcademic authors\n[CARD]\nChristopher Maidment\n[CARD]\nAcademic authors\n[CARD]\nGavin Parker\n[CARD]\nAcademic authors\nAcademic authors\nClaudia Murray\n[CARD]\nAcademic authors\nClaudia Murray\n[CARD]\nAcademic authors\n[CARD]\nClaudia Murray\n[CARD]\nAcademic authors\nAcademic authors\nZiyou Wang\n[CARD]\nAcademic authors\nZiyou Wang\n[CARD]\nAcademic authors\n[CARD]\nZiyou Wang\n[CARD]\nAcademic authors\nAcademic authors\nKaio Nogueira\n[CARD]\nAcademic authors\nKaio Nogueira\n[CARD]\nAcademic authors\n[CARD]\nKaio Nogueira\n[CARD]\nAcademic authors\nAcademic authors\nHenry Russell\n[CARD]\nAcademic authors\nHenry Russell\n[CARD]\nAcademic authors\n[CARD]\nHenry Russell\n[CARD]\nAcademic authors\n[CARD]\nGavin Parker\n[CARD]\nAcademic authors\n[CARD]\nChristopher Maidment\n[CARD]\nAcademic authors\nAcademic authors\nEmma Street\n[CARD]\nAcademic authors\nEmma Street\n[CARD]\nAcademic authors\n[CARD]\nEmma Street\n[CARD]\nAcademic authors\nAcademic authors\nAlexandros Skouralis\n[CARD]\nAcademic authors\nAlexandros Skouralis\n[CARD]\nAcademic authors\n[CARD]\nAlexandros Skouralis\n[CARD]\nAcademic authors\nAcademic authors\nJorn van de Wetering\n[CARD]\nAcademic authors\nJorn van de Wetering\n[CARD]\nAcademic authors\n[CARD]\nJorn van de Wetering\n[CARD]\nAcademic authors\nAcademic authors\nAngela Cropley\n[CARD]\nAcademic authors\nAngela Cropley\n[CARD]\nAcademic authors\n[CARD]\nAngela Cropley\n[CARD]\nAcademic authors\nAcademic authors\nNicholas Millard\n[CARD]\nAcademic authors\nNicholas Millard\n[CARD]\nAcademic authors\n[CARD]\nNicholas Millard",

It will consider different bases of value, different approaches to appraisal, required returns, yields, how cash flow is generated and how property investment relates to other asset markets.\nThis module aims to provide students with knowledge of market structures and the pricing of financial products available for indirect investments in real estate, in order to develop a critical understanding of the different features of real estate securities. It challenges the implications that specific characteristics of private real estate assets have on the pricing of such securities.\nThe module will present and analyse several sources of funding and their pricing. The process of raising equity for private real estate investment will be introduced and examined. As far as debt funding is concerned, alongside traditional methods (e.g. private lending and mortgages), the module will review structured products and hybrid forms of financing. Particular emphasis will be given to the implications of different funding structures on returns that are achieved or are achievable by equity investors.\nParticipants who successfully complete the face to face courses of the Investment Education Programme will receive the IPF Diploma from the Investment Property Forum.\nThis is an essential foundation property investment course for financial analysis and combines an introduction to basic property investment mathematics and statistics with applications to property valuation and portfolio management.\nYou will learn:\nThe course will also cover:\nBy the end of the course, you should be able to:\nSuitable for anyone wishing to improve their knowledge of financial mathematics or experience in finance and investment.\nPlease note that the content of this course focuses very much on mathematics, statistics and excel.

This new funding allows us to provide further financial support to high-potential applicants.\nIf you’re considering postgraduate study, now is a great time to apply!\nThere are two levels of scholarships awards available for 2025 entry - The Henley Business School Excellence Scholar and the Henley Business School Excellence Scholar – Dean’s List. The difference in the scholarships is reflected in the amount awarded as a tuition fee discount and the wording on the certificate that you receive.\nHome students: Henley Business School Excellence Scholars will be awarded £2,500. In exceptional cases a candidate may be selected for a Dean’s List award and allocated up to £5,000.\nInternational students: Henley Business School Excellence Scholars will typically be awarded between £3,000-£5,000 as a tuition fee waiver. Outstanding candidates selected for the Dean’s List will be allocated up to £10,000.\nScholarships are automatically awarded and consider several factors prioritising quality, based on an Admissions dept assessment of the application. The panel will also consider the World Bank PPP Conversion Factor to offer potentially higher amounts of funding to low- and middle- income countries to widen access to UK HE from countries with lower income levels. All scholarships are awarded as a reduction in tuition fees.\nAwarding commences in November and concludes in July. If you are successful, you will receive an email from the Henley Scholarships Team shortly after your offer. This typically takes up to two weeks but may take up to four weeks during busy periods.\n£970,000 awarded in four stages to reflect the application cycle and timings from different regions, with the goal of supporting a fair and equal distribution of awards. Any unclaimed allocation will be rolled forward to the next period.\nFull details will be provided in your scholarship award notification. You need to accept within four weeks of the award offer, and you will need pay a deposit to secure your place on your programme.\nAll applications will be treated separately, so if you hold offers for multiple programmes, each will be judged on its own merits. It is possible to receive a scholarship for more than one course.\nNo. Outstanding candidates can be recognised and rewarded with the Dean’s List awards.\nHenley Business School and/or University of Reading Alumni receive a 20% discount off tuition fees for 2025 entry, which is applied to the first year of tuition fees in the case of full-time students or split over two years for part-time students. The alumni discount can be combined with a scholarship. Eligible students will qualify automatically, so no additional application is needed.\nNo, you will automatically be contacted by email if you are awarded a scholarship. Your application remains eligible for a scholarship throughout the application process, so even if you are not awarded immediately your application will continue to be reviewed and considered and you will be automatically contacted if successful. We aim to get back to you as quickly as possible and ideally within four weeks. The time may be shorter (or longer) depending on the volume of applications received.\nPlease note that scholarship application is via the University of Reading applicant hub once an offer has been made. You can only apply when you have received an offer (conditional or unconditional). When you view your offer in the hub you will see the link to apply for scholarship(s) relevant to your offer. Find out more information on the AfRES Scholarship, including the application deadline and scholarship value.\nIf you have any questions, please contact us by email at postgraduate@henley.ac.uk or by phone on +44 (0)118 378 7593.\nThis site uses cookies to improve your user experience.
