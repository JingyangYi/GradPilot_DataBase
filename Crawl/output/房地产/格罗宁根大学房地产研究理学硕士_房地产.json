Our programme emphasizes the\nimportance of stakeholder engagement, moving beyond just bricks and\nmortar to focus on the households and firms that shape real estate\nmarkets.\nWe seek committed applicants who recently finished their\nbachelor programme in the field of Social Sciences who want to make\nan impact in the world, and who want to apply their intellectual\ngifts to contribute to the real estate industry.

RES) offers a unique one-year intensive\neducational programme in real estate to prepare you to become a\nleader in the real estate industry.\nUG's MSc. RES offers 10 ECTS in optional courses where you are\nable to specialize in your field of interest (e.g. finance,\neconomics, geography, planning, management, law).\nStudents have an option to pursue internships or other\nopportunities. However, there is little room in our programme for\nintensive 3 or 6-months internships as the programme is only\none-year. Therefore, we highly encourage our students to combine an\ninternship with thesis writing at a renowned firm in the field of\nreal estate or other related fields that impact the real estate\nindustry. Students who want to pursue intensive internships during\nthe Master programme without combining it with thesis writing\nextend their programme, on average, with 6 months. Students also\nhave an option to study abroad, but the same dilemmas often arise\nif one cannot combine it with thesis writing.\nWe offer a pre-master programme for students who are not\ndirectly admissible to this master.

Before starting my master I\nstudied Real Estate Management at the Hanzehogeschool. After my\nstudies I started working at the international Real Estate\nconsultancy Cushman & Wakefield, I've been employed here for\nthe last five years.\nDuring the master programme in Real Estate Studies\nyou will learn to approach real estate and the environment from an\nacademic perspective. What I found interesting was learning to\napproach the practice of real estate from a theoretical viewpoint.\nDoing this allows you to find explanations for how we deal with\nquestions regarding real etate issues. As a result of this approach\nyou can see that many topics can be reduced to a number of basic\ntheories which are still very relevant in practice when entering\nthe real estate work force as a professional.\nAfter graduating in January 2014, I immediately started working\nat the taxation department of Cushman & Wakefield in Amsterdam.\nI started out as a trainee to learn more about the necessary job\nskills. Next to this, personal development was an important aspect\nof the training. After 2,5 years I was ready to start at a more\ncommercial function, so I switched to the Office Agency team at\nCushman & Wakefield in which I advise occupants and owners when\nrenting, buying and selling office real estate.\nLooking back at the previous five years, I can conclude that I\nhave strongly developed myself as a real estate professional\nregarding both job specific as well as personal skills. A personal\nhighlight was winning the Real Estate Young Talent Award 2018. This\nis a yearly award in which five young professionals are nominated\nby an expert jury. After participating in public debates, writing\nblogs and gathering online votes I was the happy winner of this\nprize.\nAll in all this master programme has provided a strong and\nstable basis for a successful career in the Real Estate\nbusiness.\n- Tim de Vries\nThis infographic shows in which workfield alumni of the master's\nprogramme ended up, and is based on alumni who graduated between\n2022 and 2024. As is visible, the majority of the alumni have found\na job relevant to their field of study within 6 months since\ngraduating.\nWe seek focused and committed applicants who recently finished\ntheir bachelor programme in the field of Social Sciences, who want\nto make a real difference in the world, and who want to apply their\nintellectual gifts to contribute to the real estate industry. You\nwill be joining a diverse group of students and professionals who\nall share a passion for scientific rigour applied to solve complex\nsocietal issues in real estate and other fields that impact the\nreal estate industry.\nOur project based work is designed to develop your research\nskills and introduce you to group working.

It offers a Master in Real Estate Studies that integrates financial engineering, location theory and planning. You will be trained in integrating financial and economic-geographic skills with knowledge of local institutions. This programme is RICS accredited.\n> Master Real Estate Studies\nThe programme of the master Real Estate Studies consists of the following courses. Click on the course title to go to the full course description, information about lecturers, literature and time period. The courses in this programme have been scored against the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Find a general overview of how  all of our programmes relate to the SDGs.\nValue and value creation are central concepts of Corporate Finance. The value of an asset depends on the size, the timing and the risk of the expected cash flows generated by an asset. In this course you will learn how to determine the value of any asset. You will apply these techniques to value financial securities and investment opportunities of companies.\nThe square meter price of land in a metropolitan city like New York may be many times that of peripheral cities, while real estate construction costs may be the same in both places. Public squares and city parks seem to have no economic value but may generate major attractiveness to private real estate around them. In this context, understanding how economic processes shape configurations of real estate and land is of major importance. The course is designed first to develop students scientific analytical thinking about the sustainable value of real estate and land developments and second to improve their skills in measuring and analyzing these value changes.\nRelated SDG: 11 sustainable cities and communities\nThis course analyzes real estate markets in a global and institutional comparative approach. Specifically, we will analyze the international real estate markets from three aspects. First, user demand for real estate. Second, we will investigate real estate from the perspective of investors. Third, institutional settings within which international real estate markets operate are also key to understanding the functioning of international real estate markets. The course deals with institutions, differences in institutions, and the functioning of markets across housing and commercial real estate markets.\nThe real estate markets have become global, making the real estate profession an international enterprise. At the same time global, commercial brokers report huge differences among local real estate markets. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the risk and return characteristics associated with investing in both residential and commercial real estate. This course analyzes real estate markets in a global and institutional comparative approach. The course deals with institutions, differences in institutions, and the functioning of markets across housing and commercial real estate markets.\nThis course focuses on data analysis & quantitative methods that are used in real estate – broadly defined. The aim is to apply quantitative methods to real estate concepts and associated problems.\nPlanning and evaluation are key concepts in Real Estate Development (RED). This course covers concepts & principles in real estate discussing its actors, development process and real estate submarkets. During the course you must write a RED investment proposal incorporating different applications from RED planning & economics.\nFor an overview of possible courses, please visit our course catalogue Ocasys.\nThe master thesis is based on research done by yourself, whether or not with a company or another institution. Ultimately, the thesis has to result in a sound synthesis, in which you reflect on the used methods and the results of the research.\n[HTML_TABLE]\nLast modified: | 05 April 2023 12.09 p.m.\n[CARD]\nCourses master Real Estate Studies\n[CARD]\nFunctional\nFunctional\n\n                                Provides basic functions and uses anonymized cookies.\n[CARD]\nFunctional\nProvides basic functions and uses anonymized cookies.\n[CARD]\nFunctional\n[CARD]\nProvides basic functions and uses anonymized cookies.\n[CARD]\nStandard\nStandard\n\n                                Provides optimal operation and uses video cookies, among others.\n[CARD]\nStandard\nProvides optimal operation and uses video cookies, among others.\n[CARD]\nStandard\n[CARD]\nProvides optimal operation and uses video cookies, among others.\n[CARD]\nComplete\nComplete\n\n                                Provides personalized content and uses marketing cookies.\n[CARD]\nComplete\nProvides personalized content and uses marketing cookies.\n[CARD]\nComplete\n[CARD]\nProvides personalized content and uses marketing cookies.",

This programme allows the study of Spatial Sciences in\nthe broadest possible way and it trains students to become good\nresearchers.\nThe two-year Research Master in Spatial Sciences has two key\nfeatures. First, it allows students maximum scientific freedom to\nlearn and discover. Second, it lets students develop serious\nscientific research skills. Throughout the programme we take\ninspiration from Einstein's words: 'I have no special talents. I am\nonly passionately curious'. Research Master students don't have to\nbe extraordinarily talented or gifted. But students need to have a\npassionate curiosity about people and places. With this driving\ncuriosity the research master Spatial Sciences is a good\nchoice.\nMaximum scientific freedom to learn and\ndiscover\n\nStudents can design their own programme by choosing courses\naccording to their own interests. They can choose courses from all\nSpatial Sciences master programmes: environmental and\ninfrastructure planning, economic geography, population studies,\nsocio-spatial planning, or real estate studies and they may also\ninclude courses from other faculties.\nSerious development of research skills\n\nStudents become a good researcher by experiencing a series of\ncarefully designed research settings. They will participate in a\njoint multidisciplinary research challenge with other ReMa\nstudents. They will receive one-to-one individual research training\nfrom an URSI staff member involved in the tWIST research programme\nof our faculty. They will do a research internship at an\noutstanding research institute. The research experiences will be\nboth big and small: they will range from the final master thesis\ntaking several months to small half an hour researches as part of\nthe scientific diary. Students will be trained in a wide array of\nresearch methods.\nTrack\n\nIf you want to combine thorough training in scientific research\nwith a thematic specialization on islands and sustainability, we\noffer a track in Islands and Sustainability\nSpecializations\n\nThe Research Master offers a specialization option. Students\ncombine the courses of a one-year FSS master within the two-year\nResearch Master programme. They receive a formal specialization on\ntheir diploma supplement. Check all of our master's\nprogrammes to find your specialization.\nFor a top level education in geography and planning you choose\nGroningen!\nFor more information about the courses in this programme, please\nvisit https://www.rug.nl/frw/education/master-info-frw/courses-master-spatial-sciences\nIt is also possible to do the course Research Internship at a\nResearch Institute (RIRI) for 15 EC, where you replace a 5 EC part\nof Thematic Theoretical Specialization for 5 EC extra RIRI.\nStudents should have a Bachelor's degree in a discipline related\nto Regional Studies, such as Human Geography and Planning,\nEnvironment and Infrastructure Planning, or Urban Studies.

Its relevance is in addressing\nspatial aspects of the key societal challenges and emerging\ntechnological transitions of today.\nOur research programme is titled TRACE (TRAnsformations, Communities\nand Environments). Our ambition is to create scientific and\nsocietal impact by undertaking cutting-edge research at the\ninterface of people, places, and planning in rural and urban\nsettings, especially at local and regional scales, in the\nNetherlands, Europe and globally.\nThe Study Programme consists of different courses in the field\nof Spatial Sciences, related to the topics in TRACE. The specific\ncourses depend on the individual student’s interests.\nStudents have the opportunity to develop their own educational\npathway according to their preferences and motivations.\nTop researchers\nThe researchers who participate in the programme are actively\nworking on international and national research projects and bring\ntheir experiences to their teaching. For example:\nStudying the Research Master in Spatial Sciences at Groningen\nUniversity has been motivational. The research master is a two-year\nprogramme enabling you to deepen your knowledge of courses and\nmethodologies. In my case it has allowed me the time and the space\nto reflect on my interest within human geography and put this into\npractice through my research.\nThe standard of teaching at the Faculty of Spatial\nSciences is very high with staff who are understanding and\nprofessional. Having studied in Scotland for my bachelor, adjusting\nto a new education system had some challenges. I felt however that\nthe programme accommodated international students and their\ntransition to a new education system.\nOne of the highlights of this course was the opportunity to do\nan internship. I undertook this internship in Brussels with a\nresearch institute specialising in urban mobility. The internship\nwas a great experience in improving my collaboration skills with\nother researchers, while pushing me out of my comfort zone\nacademically. Working in the capital city of Europe allowed me to\nexplore the complexity and intersectional nature of urban\nmobility.\nThis master has encouraged me to pursue a career in mobility,\nand I am excited to start my thesis centered around this topic.\n- Sorcha Macintyre\nThis infographic shows in which workfield alumni of the master's\nprogramme ended up, and is based on alumni who graduated between\n2022 and 2024.
