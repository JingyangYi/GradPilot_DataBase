This applies even if you're studying abroad or have dual Australian citizenship.\nEntry points offer varying study durations and admission criteria based on the relevance of your prior studies.\nMeeting the published entry requirements for this course does not guarantee selection.\nWhere our admission criteria includes a minimum Weighted Average Mark (WAM) and/or specific subject criteria, these are based on University of Melbourne grades and subjects. If you've studied elsewhere, we'll assess your relevant prior studies and equivalent grades. Your final WAM may be adjusted depending on your previous institution's accreditation, subject grading, and pass marks.\nYou may have the option to enrol in specific single subjects through the University's Community Access Program, even if you are not enrolled in a course. Completing these prerequisite subjects may qualify you for entry into this course. This option is not available to student visa holders or applicants. Learn more about single subject study.\nYou can use our graduate coursework grade conversion eligibility calculator to get an indication of whether you are eligible for this course based on your previous studies and Weighted Average Mark (WAM).\nAll applicants to the University of Melbourne must satisfy the English language requirements. This may be achieved in a number of ways, including recognised previous study taught and assessed entirely in English or an approved English language test. If you are from a non-English speaking background, the required standard of English for this degree is one of the following English proficiency test scores:\nIf you need to undertake an English language test, you must meet one of the scores* below:\nWhen assessing applications, the Selection Committee will consider your previous studies and academic performance.\nThe Selection Committee may request additional information to clarify any aspect of an application, according to the University’s Academic Board rules regarding selection instruments.\nWe encourage domestic students to explore eligibility for Graduate Access Melbourne (GAM). GAM offers an opportunity for admission to this course even if your tertiary marks are below the standard entry requirements. GAM applicants may also be considered for financial bursaries and Commonwealth Supported Places (CSPs) where available.\nGAM categories include coming from a rural area, being an Indigenous Australian, experiencing financial hardship or personal difficulties, having refugee status, or living with a disability or medical condition. In assessing applications, we look to balance opportunity and your capacity to succeed.\nPrior studies may be credited towards your degree and potentially reduce the duration of your course. This is known as Advanced Standing (also known as credit or recognition of prior learning).\nContact-support \n    How can we help?\n• Arrow-right  \n          #8\n         \n          in graduate employability worldwide\n• Arrow-right  \n          #19\n         \n          university in the world\n• Course code:\n         MC-PROP\n• English language test score requirements\n              Chevron-down\n• If you need to undertake an English language test, you must meet one of the scores* below:\n               \n    IELTS\n   \n    6.5\n   \n  with no band less than 6.0\n    TOEFL\n   \n    79+\n   \n  with writing 21; speaking 18; reading 13; listening 13\n    PEARSON\n   \n    64+\n   \n  with no communicative skill below 60\n    CAMBRIDGE\n   \n    176+\n   \n  with no skill less than 169 \n                *Accepted tests: IELTS (Academic English Only); TOEFL Internet-based test; Pearson Test of English Academic; Cambridge English: Advanced/Certificate of Advanced English (CAE).
