Increasing homelessness demands new affordable housing. Climate change requires adaptive and sustainable building methods. An aging population needs senior-friendly homes and neighborhoods. Remote work and online retail necessitate the repurposing of commercial buildings.\nThe UCLA MRED program builds on the Luskin School’s mission to create agents of change, focusing on public service, sustainability and equity. From planning to finance to design, decisions about what to build and where to build influence equity and sustainability in ways that are often neglected in traditional real estate development programs.\nLearn More\nGet in Touch\n\nSean Campbell\nAssociate Director of Admissions & Recruitment\nsean@luskin.ucla.edu\n(310) 825-8957\nSchedule an appointment here!\nUpcoming Info Sessions\nRequest Info\nInfo Sessions\n[GRID_TABLE]\nRequest Info\nInfo Sessions\n[GRID_TABLE]\nContact UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs\r\n3250 Public Affairs Building - Box 951656Los Angeles, CA 90095-1656\nCampus Resources   Maps, Directions, Parking\nDirectory\nContact\nAcademic Calendar\nCareers\nDiversity\nUniversity of California\nTerms of Use\nFollow \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nThe statements on this page represent the views of people affiliated with the Luskin School of Public Affairs and do not necessarily represent the views of the University of California, or UCLA or its Chancellor.\nPosts and comments by individuals at UCLA on social media channels may not reflect the opinions or policies of UCLA, the University of California or the Luskin School, nor its benefactors and academic partners.\nThe statements on this page represent the views of people affiliated with the Luskin School of Public Affairs and do not necessarily represent the views of the University of California, or UCLA or its Chancellor.\nPosts and comments by individuals at UCLA on social media channels may not reflect the opinions or policies of UCLA, the University of California or the Luskin School, nor its benefactors and academic partners.\n[CARD]\nUCLA Master of Real Estate Development (MRED)\nPrepare for the future of real estate\n[CARD]\nApply\n[CARD]\nInfo Sessions\n[CARD]\nMore Info\n[CARD]\nMore Info\n[CARD]\nLearn More\n[CARD]\nLearn More\n[CARD]\nLearn More\n[CARD]\nFull Listing of Industry Partners\n[CARD]\nLearn More\n[CARD]\nRequest Info\n[CARD]\nApply\n[CARD]\nInfo Sessions",
