Each year, approximately 30-35 applicants are admitted as students.\nSuccessful candidates often complete an undergraduate or graduate degree in a discipline as a basis for work in real estate. Traditionally related disciplines include: engineering, construction, architecture, planning, economics, finance, business, and law.\nMost admitted students have strong academic records coupled with three to five years professional experience in related professions. Related professions include real estate brokers, construction managers, city planners, architects, commercial loan officers, consultants, financial analysts, or engineers.\nWe do not offer part-time, online, or special student status.\nThe application portal for the 2025-26 academic year will open September 1, 2024.\nPlease visit MIT Graduate Admissions for:\nAll candidates are required to have completed microeconomics at the college level. A student who is otherwise qualified but deficient in this course may be admitted provisionally and required to satisfy the prerequisite before enrolling.\nGRE/GMATS Optional\nApplicants to the MSRED program are strongly encouraged but not required to submit GMAT or GRE scores with their applications.\nGMAT or GRE quantitative scores are particularly useful to the admissions committee in evaluating applicants who do not have work experience in engineering, finance and accounting, or economics or who do not have an academic record of achievement in quantitative fields.  A significant number of courses in the MSRED program require students to apply practical quantitative skills.\nIf English is not your native language (regardless of your educational background) you must either submit either TOELF or IELTS test scores or apply for an English Language Test Waiver (due by 12/15 of the application year)\nThe Center for Real Estate offers a limited number of fellowships for which MSRED students may apply. Applications for the CRE fellowships/fellow programs are submitted via the online MSRED Application.\nInformation about MITs financial support for graduate students is available on the OGE website.\nClosing the GAAP is a volunteer-based, student-run program that provides assistance to applicants from communities historically underrepresented in higher education and the real estate industry.\nCandidates with less than three years of experience should apply through the Young Leaders Program (YLP). Up to 10% of a typical incoming class are participants in the YLP.\nIn order to pursue a dual degree program at MIT you need to apply to each program separately. Once admitted, you must then satisfy the requirements of both programs in order to receive both degrees. Normally, students complete a dual degree program in two years plus one additional term.\nVisit our FAQ page for answers to frequently asked questions about admissions to the Master’s degree program in real estate as well as program-related questions.\n• Graduate application requirements\n• Standardized test requirements\n• Terms of enrollment\n• Special requirements",
