      "content": "[HEADING] Overview\n[HEADING] SEARCH\nThe Master of Science in Real Estate (MSc(RE)) programme approaches real estate from a business and economic perspective. The aims of the programme are threefold. The first aim is to introduce students to real estate assets and markets, within the overall framework of law, institutions, and urban economies. The second aim is to provide students with the theoretical insights and analytical skills to identify and evaluate real estate investment opportunities in both private and public sectors, including land development, asset management, financial market transactions (e.g. REIT), and innovative land conversion ventures (e.g. PERE). The third aim is to equip students with the necessary management skills to understand and participate in functional and general management of enterprises active in real estate markets.\nMSc(RE), including all its majors, is recognized by RICS and both the General Practice Division and Planning & Development Division of HKIS.\nEach year we target to admit about 60 MSc(RE) students, full-time and part-time.  Students come from all over the world – each class typically has a mix of 10 different nationalities.  Most of them come from top 300 or reputable universities around the world, including Australia, Canada, China, Germany, U.K. and U.S.A.  Their undergraduate majors are mainly business, architecture, engineering, social sciences and law.  They all have a strong interest in real estate through their work or personal experience – they might want to make a career change, become a professional, promote to a senior position, or manage a family business.  Students will have a lot of opportunities to learn from each other, as many  come from real estate related sectors such as developers, landlords, asset managers and professional consultants.\nLearning Outcomes\nAfter completion of the programme, graduates will be able to:\n• Communicate effectively with other related professionals in the real estate and construction industries;\n• Apply relevant theory to practice as it applies to real estate development and investment to suit different organizational and regional contexts;\n• Integrate relevant knowledge in real estate development and investment with other disciplines in order to enhance professional practice skills;\n• Apply critical thinking, analytical as well as research skills to investigate issues within the real estate industry in a local, regional and global context;\n• Implement effective development and investment strategies to real estate and construction projects.\n• History\n• HKUrbanLabs\n• Asia’s Global University\n• Faculty

Real Estate\n \n\nOverview\n\n\nHOME / Programmes / Real Estate and Construction / Master of Science in Real Estate \n\n\nThe Master of Science in Real Estate (MSc(RE)) programme approaches real estate from a business and economic perspective. The aims of the programme are threefold. The first aim is to introduce students to real estate assets and markets, within the overall framework of law, institutions, and urban economies. The second aim is to provide students with the theoretical insights and analytical skills to identify and evaluate real estate investment opportunities in both private and public sectors, including land development, asset management, financial market transactions (e.g. REIT), and innovative land conversion ventures (e.g. PERE). The third aim is to equip students with the necessary management skills to understand and participate in functional and general management of enterprises active in real estate markets.\nMSc(RE), including all its majors, is recognized by RICS and both the General Practice Division and Planning & Development Division of HKIS.\nEach year we target to admit about 60 MSc(RE) students, full-time and part-time.  Students come from all over the world – each class typically has a mix of 10 different nationalities.  Most of them come from top 300 or reputable universities around the world, including Australia, Canada, China, Germany, U.K. and U.S.A.  Their undergraduate majors are mainly business, architecture, engineering, social sciences and law.  They all have a strong interest in real estate through their work or personal experience – they might want to make a career change, become a professional, promote to a senior position, or manage a family business.  Students will have a lot of opportunities to learn from each other, as many  come from real estate related sectors such as developers, landlords, asset managers and professional consultants.\nLearning Outcomes\nAfter completion of the programme, graduates will be able to:\n\nCommunicate effectively with other related professionals in the real estate and construction industries;\nApply relevant theory to practice as it applies to real estate development and investment to suit different organizational and regional contexts;\nIntegrate relevant knowledge in real estate development and investment with other disciplines in order to enhance professional practice skills;\nApply critical thinking, analytical as well as research skills to investigate issues within the real estate industry in a local, regional and global context;\nImplement effective development and investment strategies to real estate and construction projects.",

to professionals working in the field of Smart Built Environment.The built environment faces digital transformation, health and safety, digital trust, carbon neutrality and other sustainability issues. MSc(DMBA) offers cutting-edge knowledge and a new way of working with digital twin technologies, building information modelling (BIM), geographic information system (GIS), artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML), PropTech, blockchain and metaverse/gaming technologies available in the MetaBIM Research Lab (one of the HKUrbanLabs at the Faculty of Architecture) that focuses on Internationalisation, Innovation, Interdisciplinarity, Impact and A.I.With the learning experience of disruptive digital technologies, students will be able to close the gap between virtual and reality while managing the built assets, for example, through the effective use of a single source of information within a Common Data Environment (CDE) and other digital twin technologies, setting up information requirements for asset owners, developing a successful project execution plan, understanding standards harmonisation across a project's life-cycle, and integrating Systems of Systems (SoS) and other organisational processes to ensure the built assets can last longer and perform better.Overall, students, through classwork, case method courses, tech simulations, and semester-long projects, will learn and develop skills in:‧ Strategic technology management, developing skills in the direction of digital twin technologies, CDE, BIM, GIS, AI/ML, PropTech, blockchain and metaverse/game technologies‧ Change management in organisations and projects‧ Team building, collaborative design, project management and built assets management‧ Understanding and managing interdisciplinary and cross-cultural differences in teams‧ Understanding the life-cycle of the best-practice project, information and built assets management experiences for the Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Owner-operated (AECO) industry‧ Broadening their global horizon regarding innovation and contextualising digital tools for a smart built environment on such issues as carbon neutrality and sustainability goals, e.g. the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).The course is designed to provide real estate and construction professionals (e.g. facilities managers, asset managers, architects, designers, surveyors, civil and structural engineers) with advanced education in key aspects of the land conversion or development process that involve decisions using digital technologies related to the through-life operation of built assets in both the private and public sectors. We aim to train future leaders to drive the transformation of the world's largest ecosystem and to reshape the next generation of smart built environment in Hong Kong and the GBA region.The programme is offered with contributions from the local industry and internationally renowned visiting professors. It is professionally accredited by the Chartered Institute of Building (CIOB), and the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS).
