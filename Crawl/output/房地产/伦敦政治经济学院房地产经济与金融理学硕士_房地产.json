You'll acquire significant theoretical and technical knowledge to equip you to understand urban economic processes, price determination in land and real property markets, and their interrelation with investment markets, investment analysis and portfolio choice as well as the impact of land use regulations, transport, public policy and socio-economic change. This programme will appeal if you wish to work, or are already working, in a specialised area relating to property and urban analysis, real estate finance or investment analysis.\nThe programme benefits from a partnership with the Investment Property Forum (IPF), which has included the programme on their selected list of graduate courses that it judges provide the relevant skills necessary for those operating in the property investment market. This recognition comes with a number of benefits for our master's graduates, including fast-track membership to the forum. In addition, the programme has an agreement with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS), thus conferring professional recognition.\nThe Masters in Real Estate Economics and Finance is accredited by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS). Students who pass their degree will automatically gain accreditation.\nYou're not required to do any preparatory reading for MSc Real Estate Economics and Finance (unless specifically noted in your offer letter), but if you'd like to prepare, the following is relevant to the programme:\nUpper second class honours degree (2:1) or equivalent with background in economic analysis, and good analytical, quantitative and technical skills.\nIn exceptional cases, when a candidate has a very strong academic background in a related discipline but insufficient background in (micro-) economics, as a condition of admission candidates may be required to take an LSE summer school course in Intermediate Microeconomics and obtain a specified grade.\nPlease note that due to the high demand for places on the MSc Real Estate Economics and Finance, those accepted on to this programme won't normally be granted a programme transfer. If you don't intend to follow the programme, you must withdraw your application prior to Registration and apply directly to your new programme choice using the LSE online application system.\nFind out more about the ESRC-funded pathway onto a PhD programme\nPlease select your country from the dropdown list below to find out the entry requirements that apply to you.\nEnglish language requirements\nThe English language requirement for this programme is Standard.

Most delays and confusion are caused when applicants do not follow our instructions.\nYou must apply early, as competition for programmes at LSE is intense. Your application will not be considered until we have received all your supporting documents. Wherever possible you should submit all of your documents with your online application. You should expect to wait an average of 8 weeks for a decision when applying for a taught programme; decisions for a research programme may take longer than this.\nImportant:  LSE expects all applicants to complete their application materials without the use of paid agents or other paid professional assistance. The use of such services may lead to the rejection of application materials, the revocation of an admissions offer, cancellation of admission, or involuntary withdrawal from the University.\nUnscrupulous agents have been known to charge large sums to applicants, and then to submit fraudulent transcripts and references. They have refused to allow applicants access to their own records on our Graduate Applicant Portal Applicants have been left unable to attend LSE and having to sue the agent for financial redress. Agents who claim to 'guarantee' entry to LSE are lying. All applications are considered on their own merits and all applicants can and should submit their own information.\nNOTICE: Please be aware of an issue that has come to our attention regarding email junk/spam filters. Some email software is filtering LSE emails to the spam/junk or ‘Deleted Items/Bin’ folder so please make sure to check there for important information regarding your application. If you do find any of our emails in any of these folders, please make sure to add the domain @lse.ac.uk to your ‘Safe Senders’ or ‘Never Block’ list. Emails will be sent to you automatically from our database system once you have begun your online application and as your application progresses through each step in the process (application created; application submitted; application downloaded for processing). We will then send you a further email each time there is an update to the status of your application, including any requests for further information and the programme selectors’ decision on your application. It is essential that you ensure you can successfully receive our emails as soon as you begin your application.\nYou will need to create an account in the online application system using your email address. You should use the same email address for your application and any enquiries to us. You do not need to complete the online application form at one sitting; you can return to your partially completed application by logging back into the system using the email address and password you create at the start of the process.\nYou may submit an application via the online application system only ONCE within the application cycle (October 2024 to September 2025), so before submitting your application you should ensure that you have included all of the information you would like the selectors to review. Any further changes after your application has been submitted must be requested via the Graduate Applicant Portal and will be subject to our current processing times.\nYou must upload all of your supporting documents and nominate two referees via the online application system. The online application allows you to submit your complete application securely and quickly. Your submitted application will not be processed and considered until we have received all the required supporting documents, including a reference from each of the referees you nominate on your online application.\nIf you encounter any technical issues while completing your application, please use the “technical support” link located in the bottom-left corner of the application portal to contact us. If you begin a further new application you will not be able to transfer any information, documents, or references between them.\nWhen completing your initial online application, you may choose up to two programmes in order of preference. If you are applying for two programmes, please submit a separate statement of academic purpose for each programme. Your choices will be considered in sequence, and it is only possible to hold one offer of a place, so if you are offered a place on your first-choice programme you will not be considered for your second-choice unless you specifically request it. If you receive an offer on your first choice, and wish us to send your second choice to be considered too, please use the Add/Amend programmes form on the Graduate Applicant Portal, selecting your current second choice programme as the programme you wish to be considered for.\nIf you are unsuccessful in your application to both of your initially chosen programmes and you wish to be considered for further, additional choices, you may do this by submitting the Add/Amend programmes via the Graduate Applicant Portal and paying an additional administrative fee of £105. You should not use this form to add choices 3 and 4 before receiving a decision on each of your original programme choices, unless you wish to withdraw your initial programme choices.\nPlease note that changing your programme choices after you have submitted your online application may cause significant delays to your application being considered.\nYou are not permitted to submit an application using the online application system more than ONCE in the same admissions cycle. If you submit a second online application within the same admissions cycle, it will not be considered. To apply to further programmes after you have submitted your initial online application, you must use the process above.\nAll applications must be accompanied by supporting documents. Some of these are required by all applicants, others are only needed for specific programmes. Details of specific requirements are given on the programme pages.\nPlease consult our guide to supporting documents for full information about what you will need.\nPlease do not send supporting documents directly to departments as this will delay your application.\nPlease remember that it is your responsibility to ensure that your application is complete, including both references, your statement of academic purpose and CV, your transcript(s), the application assessment fee, and, where applicable, GRE/GMAT scores, your research proposal and/or your sample of written work.\nLSE has developed a number of programmes which are administered jointly with other institutions such as Peking University in China and University of Southern California in the USA.

There are also funding opportunities from external organisations, research councils and governments around the world.\nEvery graduate student is charged a fee for their programme. If you receive an offer, you will be informed of the relevant tuition fee amount in your offer letter.\nTuition fee amounts\nTuition fee amounts are listed on the individual programme pages. The table of fees shows the latest tuition amounts for all programmes offered by the School.\nIn some cases the amount of tuition fees you will need to pay, and any financial support you are eligible for, will depend on whether you are classified as a Home or Overseas student, otherwise known as your fee status.\nLSE assesses your fee status based on guidelines provided by the Department of Education.\nFurther information about fee status classification.\nFee reductions\nStudents who completed undergraduate study at LSE and are beginning taught graduate study at the School are eligible for a fee reduction of 10 per cent of the fee. Some programmes, such as executive programmes, are excluded from this fee reduction.\nFurther information\nAlumni discountFees and Student FinanceLSE Student Fees Policy\nWe broadly estimate that you should allow about £1,300-£1,500 per month for all living expenses, including accommodation, travel, food, laundry, study costs, and other personal expenses. This will vary depending on your lifestyle and requirements, so it's important you do your own research.\nPlease note that if you will be applying for a visa, you will have to provide evidence of sufficient funds, and these amounts may vary.\nMore details on living costs and making a budget.\nGraduate Support Scheme\nLSE Master's Awards\nDonor-funded awards for Home fee status students\nProgramme-related funding\nAnniversary Scholarships\nLSE Access to Education Graduate Scholarship\nCountry based awards\nThe School makes available scholarships for students from specific regions of the world:\nCountry-based awards for taught master's students: A - C\nCountry-based awards for taught master's students: D - K\nCountry-based awards for taught master's students: L - Q\nCountry-based awards for taught master's students: R - Z\nHow to apply\nSee Applying for an LSE scholarship\nFor 2025 entry, LSE will be offering studentships to new PhD students in the form of LSE PhD Studentships, LSE ESRC Studentships and LAHP AHRC Studentships.\nThese awards are open to high calibre students of all nationalities studying across all research areas at the School.\nLSE PhD Studentships\nLSE PhD Studentships are tenable for four years and cover full fees and an annual stipend. They are available for UK, EU and international students undertaking research in any LSE discipline, with annual renewal subject to satisfactory academic performance.\nThese awards will be made solely on the basis of outstanding academic merit and research potential. This relates both to your past academic record and to an assessment of your likely aptitude to complete a PhD in your chosen topic in the time allocated.\nESRC funding\nLSE has an Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) Doctoral Training Partnership (DTP) and has ESRC studentships in a number of programmes across 19 departments. These studentships are available for students of all nationalities.\nThe structure and duration of the studentship offered will depend on a candidate's previous academic experience, and social research training & experience. ESRC studentships are applicable to both full-time and part-time study. We can discuss part-time options with you if you are interested in applying. They cover full fees (for international students, LSE will cover the difference between UK and overseas fees) and an annual stipend.\nIndividual programme entries detail which programme are eligible for ESRC funding.\nAHRC funding\nLSE is part of LAHP (London Arts and Humanities Partnership), which is funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council. Students of all nationalities can apply for one of these studentships.\nStudentships are tenable for three years and they cover full fees (for international students, LSE will cover the difference between UK and overseas fees) and an annual stipend. UKRI expects all projects to be designed in a way that enables students to submit within their funded period.\nLSE Departments that typically host AHRC studentships are International History, Media and Communications, Philosophy and Law, but students from other disciplines (for example, Anthropology, Gender Studies and International Development), can also apply if their research falls within the remit of AHRC, as explained here.\nLSE CSC Scholarship\nLSE is proud to partner with the China Scholarship Council (CSC) to offer the LSE-CSC Scholarship. This prestigious scholarship supports outstanding students from China in pursuing their research degree at LSE.\nLSE is pleased to offer up to eight scholarships each academic year. These scholarships are tenable for up to four years and recipients must be enrolled in a full time study mode.\nDepartment-specific funding\nCheck the programme-related funding page for PhD funding opportunities.\nHow to apply\nExcept for LAHP studentships (see below), academic departments nominate students for the funding opportunity they may be eligible for.

They are available for UK, EU and international students undertaking research in any LSE discipline, with annual renewal subject to satisfactory academic performance.\nThese awards will be made solely on the basis of outstanding academic merit and research potential. This relates both to your past academic record and to an assessment of your likely aptitude to complete a PhD in your chosen topic in the time allocated.\nESRC funding\nLSE has an Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) Doctoral Training Partnership (DTP) and has ESRC studentships in a number of programmes across 19 departments. These studentships are available for students of all nationalities.\nThe structure and duration of the studentship offered will depend on a candidate's previous academic experience, and social research training & experience. ESRC studentships are applicable to both full-time and part-time study. We can discuss part-time options with you if you are interested in applying.

UKRI expects all projects to be designed in a way that enables students to submit within their funded period. \nLSE Departments that typically host AHRC studentships are International History, Media and Communications, Philosophy and Law, but students from other disciplines (for example, Anthropology, Gender Studies and International Development), can also apply if their research falls within the remit of AHRC, as explained here.\nLSE CSC Scholarship\nLSE is proud to partner with the China Scholarship Council (CSC) to offer the LSE-CSC Scholarship. This prestigious scholarship supports outstanding students from China in pursuing their research degree at LSE. \nLSE is pleased to offer up to eight scholarships each academic year.

If you have a greater need, and you submit a personal statement with your Graduate Financial Support Application, you will be considered for other LSE scholarships which can offer a higher level of funding.\nAfter you submit your application for admission to LSE, you will be given access to the Graduate Applicant Portal. This allows you to track all aspects of your application for admission and will include a link to the LSE Graduate Financial Support online application.\nThe deadline for completing the form for those starting at LSE in 2025 is 07 May 2025 (application will close at 5pm UK time).

We encourage you to submit your test results with your application (please fill in the relevant section of the application form). Any offer of admission will be subject to proof of your score.\nIf you have not taken a test by the time you apply, your application can still be considered without it, but any offer will be conditional on the required score. Please note that people applying via Sciences Po to Double Degree programmes must meet the requirement at the point they apply.\nYou can meet our language requirements in the following ways:\nYou are a national and resident of Canada or one of the UKVI list of majority English-speaking countries below (whose first language is English). If it is not clear elsewhere in your application, please provide an indication that English was the language of instruction in your primary/secondary education or\nYou have successfully completed an undergraduate degree (of at least three years duration), a postgraduate taught degree (of at least one year) or a PhD in one of those countries listed below or\nYou have passed a recognised English language test at an appropriate level. Our preferred tests are listed below. We expect you to reach the required level at a single setting of the test, but may accept IELTS One Skill Retake at the discretion of the selectors. If you have achieved the required score in this way, please send us your results so that we can consider them.\nPlease note that 2+2 undergraduate degrees where less than three years has been spent in a majority English-speaking country and degrees taken at overseas campuses of English speaking institutions in non majority English speaking countries (eg Chinese campuses of UK institutions) are insufficient to meet our requirements and you will be required to supply a test score. The same is true for students of the University of London International Programme (UoLIP) whose study has not been undertaken in a majority English-speaking country.\nEnglish tests must be less than two years old on 1 October 2025.\nThe condition we set depends on your programme - see the English language test requirements table below. If you are set an English language condition, we encourage you to book a test at your earliest opportunity.\nIf you are unable to take one of our preferred tests, it may be possible for you to take an alternative test such as Duolingo or IELTS Indicator and supplement your score by taking the LSE Language Centre Assessment. To request this option, you should complete the extenuating circumstances form on the GAP, providing any existing test scores and giving the reasons why you are unable to take one of the tests below.
