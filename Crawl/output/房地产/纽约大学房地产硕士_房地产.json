The Office of Admissions will not accept TOEFL or IELTS scores that are older than two years.\nCan I request a waiver for the English Language Proficiency Requirements?\n\nA TOEFL or IELTS waiver may be requested for the following reasons:\n\nIf an official letter is submitted by the institution stating all classes were conducted in English. Please upload this letter directly to your application along with your transcripts.\nIf it is stated on the academic transcript or school website that all classes are conducted in English.\nIf a graduate degree was conducted in English or the institution is in a country where English is the only primary language.\nIf the applicant completed 3 years of undergraduate studies at an institution where English is the medium of instruction and 1 year at their international institution.\n\n A TOEFL/IELTS waiver can only be granted after the submission of your application.\nWhat is the Video and Writing Reflection?\n\nThe Video and Writing Reflection - Powered by Kira Talent, is an online assessment tool designed to evaluate video questions and written assessments. This assessment allows the Admissions Committee to analyze skills we value such as collaboration and global-mindedness, integrity, critical and analytical thinking skills, and effective written and oral communication. The Kira assessment incorporates various components to evaluate applicants, including 1 video question and a timed writing activity.\nDuring the online assessment, you will be asked a series of questions, given prep time, and a set amount of time to respond. The assessment is brief and will take 20 to 30 minutes to complete.\n\nVideo & Written Reflection Explained\nWhen should I register for the Video and Writing Reflection?\n\nTo expedite the processing of your application, we recommend that applicants register and complete the Kira assessment promptly upon creating their graduate application. The Kira Assessment link can take 24–48 hours to appear in your application.\nHow long does it take to complete the Video and Writing Reflection?\n\nThe assessment is brief and will only take you 20–30 minutes to complete. The system allows for unlimited practice sessions but once you start the formal interview questions, you only get one chance. This allows us to capture your candid responses.\nWhen does Admissions receive my Video and Writing Reflection score?\n\nIt typically takes 3-4 weeks for the Admissions Office to receive the score.\nHelp! I’m having technical difficulties during the Video and Writing Reflection.\n\nIf you have any questions, or cannot complete Kira, please email support@kiratalent.com.\nWhat technology will I need to complete the Video and Writing Reflection?\n\nTo complete this requirement, you will need a desktop or laptop computer with a functioning webcam, microphone, and internet connection.\nI didn’t prepare for the Video and Writing Reflection. Can I retake it?\n\nApplicants may not retake the Kira. The questions asked on the Kira assessment are meant to be candid responses to allow us to understand your critical thinking skills through spontaneous answers.\nCan I defer my enrollment if offered admission?\n\nIf you are accepted, you may have the option to defer your enrollment directly through the online enrollment form. You will be given the option to defer your enrollment for up to one year from your original acceptance term. Please note that deferrals are typically only granted based on significant, extenuating circumstances.\nCan I reapply if my application is denied?\n\nStudents who have been denied admission will not be permitted to reapply to any program at the School of Professional Studies for one academic year—this includes applying as a non-matriculant student.\nHow do I confirm my decision to enroll?\n\nTo reserve your place in the program, please complete the online enrollment form (Reply Form) accessible via your acceptance letter.\nHow do I submit my tuition deposit?\n\nAs noted on your acceptance message, the tuition deposit is non-refundable and will be applied to your first term's tuition when you enroll. Your acceptance is only final once we receive your non-refundable deposit. The preferred methods of payment are credit card or electronic check.\nIf those options are not available to you, you may mail your tuition check or money order by your deposit deadline payable to  \"New York University\" at the following address:\nNYU BURSAR OFFICE\n383 Lafayette St\nNew York, NY 10003\nATTN: Tuition Deposit\nThe check or money order must be in US funds only; be sure to include your University ID number and Enrollment Term in the memo section.\nHow do I apply for an I-20?\n\nOnce you have activated your NetID, you will be able to complete the I-20 request form on the student portal. If you need assistance with the process, you should contact the NYU Office of Global Services (OGS) directly.\nWhere can I find my Net ID?\n\nTo obtain and activate your NetID, visit NYU Start. If you encounter difficulty in activating your NetID, contact the Help Desk for technical assistance at AskITS@nyu.edu or 212-998-3333.\nI have been accepted for a degree I no longer want. Can I change my program?\n\nYou may request a program change, however, we highly encourage you to first speak with your current academic advisor to discuss your academic and career goals. NYU SPS graduate programs are highly specialized degrees and when applicants submit their initial application they are expected to understand how the degree aligns with their academic and professional goals.\nIf you choose to move forward with a program change application, please note that this is not an automatic admission to the new program and your request may be accepted or denied. If your program change is approved, you will receive an email confirming the approved change. If, however, your change of program application is denied, you will have the choice to enroll in your initial degree program. The Admissions Committee will re-review your master’s degree application, based on your new program of choice. Please allow 3-4 weeks for this new application to be reviewed and processed. Please complete the program change application and submit it to the Admissions Office at sps.admissions@nyu.edu.\nNote that program changes through the NYU SPS Office of Admissions are for new students only. If you have completed any coursework towards an SPS degree, please contact your academic adviser for additional information regarding program changes as a current student.\n[GRID_TABLE]\n96%\n\n\nworking or in school in 6 months [1]\nworking or in school in 6 months [1]\nworking or in school in 6 months [1]\n$76K\n\n\nmean starting salary of master’s graduates [1]\nmean starting salary of master’s graduates [1]\nmean starting salary of master’s graduates [1]\n19%\n\n\nof master’s students attend part-time\nof master’s students attend part-time\nof master’s students attend part-time\n44%\n\n\nmaster’s students taking at least some classes online [2]\nmaster’s students taking at least some classes online [2]\nmaster’s students taking at least some classes online [2]\n62%\n\n\ninternational students\ninternational students\ninternational students\n[CARD]\nFall 2025 - Open\nROUND\n[CARD]\nSpring 2026 - Open\nROUND\n[CARD]\nSummer 2026 - Application Opens August 2025\nROUND\n[CARD]\nFall 2026 - Application Opens August 2025\nROUND\n[CARD]\nDAUS Instant Decision Day\n[CARD]\nUndergraduate Information Session\n[CARD]\nGraduate Studies Information Session\n[CARD]\n$26,502\nper term for full-time (10-12 credits)\n[CARD]\n$26,502\n[CARD]\nper term for full-time (10-12 credits)\n[CARD]\n$2,575\nper credit for part-time\n[CARD]\n$2,575\n[CARD]\nper credit for part-time\n[CARD]\nFor me, it’s about embracing different cultures and thriving in unfamiliar environments while finding inspiration in every journey.”\n[CARD]\nThe master's program helped me learn more about real-life scenarios that could happen for events as small as 100 people and as big as 10,000.\"\n[CARD]\nNYU has name-brand recognition amongst many employers.\"\n[CARD]\nEmbrace every opportunity and challenge with an open mind and a full heart.\"\n[CARD]\nHave a Question?\nHave a Question?\nNot sure where to begin, want more information, or need help completing your application?
