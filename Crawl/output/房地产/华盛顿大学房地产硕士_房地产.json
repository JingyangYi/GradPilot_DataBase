      "content": "Graduate Non-Matriculated Students (GNM)\nUnder certain conditions, we may offer enrollment in the Real Estate graduate courses to Graduate Non-Matriculated students (GNM). The purpose of GNM enrollment is to allow qualified students to earn limited graduate credit in a particular area of need. Applicants who meet graduate admissions standards may be enrolled as GNM students and may apply up to a maximum of 12 credits earned while so enrolled toward graduate degree requirements if later accepted into the Master in Science and Real Estate (MSRE) degree program. Individuals interested in applying credits earned while enrolled as a GNM student in the MSRE or another graduate program must contact the respective program(s) to find out if and how those credits may be transferrable.\nFor more information about GNM status at the University of Washington, please visit the Graduate School’s Graduate Non-Matriculated Students page at the following link\nHow to Apply\nWe welcome your application as a Graduate Non-Matriculated student. The GNM program’s primary goal is to enable students to take graduate level courses in order to explore the professional field of Real Estate.\nDeadline dates for submission of GNM application materials are as follows:\nAutumn Quarter: August 15\nWinter Quarter: November 15\nSpring Quarter: February 15\nSummer Quarter: May 1\nOnline Application\nApplication for Admission to the Graduate School\nGNM applicants must submit an application through the Graduate School’s Application for Admission to the Graduate School web page, available at https://www.grad.washington.edu/applForAdmiss/. Once you designate the program you are applying for, you will be prompted for the required application materials. GNM applicants are advised to contact the Program to notify them of their application submission in order to facilitate a timely review of their application.\nStatement of Purpose\nPrepare a one or two page statement as to your reasons for undertaking graduate study in Real Estate and your plans for future study; please describe portions of your background that you feel are particularly relevant to your application. The statement of purpose should be submitted via the Graduate School’s Application for Admission to the Graduate School web page at https://www.grad.washington.edu/applForAdmiss/.\nLetter of Recommendation\nGNM applicants are required to submit one academic letter of recommendation. The letter must be submitted directly to the Real Estate program in an envelope sealed by the recommender. We suggest applicants provide their evaluator with a copy of the statement of purpose in order to facilitate the evaluation.\nComplete Set of Transcripts\nApplicants must list and submit transcripts for all collegiate institutions they have attended, including the University of Washington. Unofficial transcripts should be uploaded to the online application.\nGNM Application Review\nApplications are reviewed by the Graduate Program Coordinator and the Admissions Committee. You will be notified of the status of your application after the evaluation is completed.\nAcceptance to the GNM program is on a quarter by quarter basis; your application will be reviewed again should you wish to continue in the program for more than one quarter. All GNM courses are available on a space available basis only. If you are offered admission to the Real Estate program as a GNM student and you decline to take classes, you must then reapply for any future quarter during which you would like to be enrolled.\nGNM students who decide to pursue the MSRE degree must make a separate application. Admission to the MSRE program is normally for Autumn quarter. Space permitting, Winter quarter applications to the MSRE program are considered.\nMore Information\n• For further information on GNM status, please visit the About Non-Degree Enrollment page on the UW Non-Degree Enrollment website at http://www.outreach.washington.edu/nondegree/about/.\n• For helpful information for approved GNM applicants, please visit the Registration Steps for Graduate Nonmatriculated Students page on the UW Non-Degree Enrollment website at: http://www.outreach.washington.edu/nondegree/register/steps_gnm.asp.",
