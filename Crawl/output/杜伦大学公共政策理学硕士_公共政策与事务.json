Our custom-designed MSc in Public Policy critically examines global policy concerns, exploring the reasons why decisions are made and how these decisions impact different areas of society.\nCovering all aspects of the policy process from agenda setting to evaluation, the curriculum has been developed to equip you with the skills to examine diverse policy issues, make evidence-driven decisions, and evaluate their success or failure. Whether you are looking for a role with an NGO or government, or simply looking to advance your private sector role with a cutting-edge ability to evaluate how policy decisions will shape your industry, this course gives you the skills to advance your career. \nWith modules covering public policy and data analysis, the course hones your ability to analyse and interpret data to address global public policy questions. The diverse range of policy and analytical modules provide you with bespoke skills. The capstone project allows you to put your learning into practice by collaborating with an external organisation to address key policy-related questions. This evidence-based project prepares you for future employment providing you with hands-on experience and showcasing your qualifications and practical problem-solving skills.\nThe course is multidisciplinary, drawing on politics, economics, social policy, and sociology. It is likely to appeal to those looking to pursue a career in policy planning, political consultancy, and financial services, as well as policy-based roles in local and national government, international development and NGOs.Course structureYear 1 modulesCore modules:Public Policy explores how policy is made across the world, including the impact of diverse institutional arrangements. In this module you will analyse the intersection of political behaviour and institutional governance in policy formation.\nOne from:\nQuantitative Methods and Analysis, for those without prior data analysis experience. This module is an introductory route to data analysis. You will cover elements of research design, statistical analysis, and learn about data collection.\nFull Stack Research Design, for those with prior data analysis experience. This module delves into data analysis approaches to policy evaluation, including regression modelling.\nAnd: \nCausal Inference offers hands-on expertise in causal inference methods for data analysis, exploring (quasi-)experimental designs and techniques for understanding whether policies work and why.\nThe Capstone Project is an opportunity to collaborate with NGOs or government departments to address a policy challenge and provide strategic analysis to refine your future direction.Dissertation \nThe Dissertation in Public Policy is a substantial piece of independent work in an aspect of public policy of your choice.The 10,000-word dissertation is the culmination of the MSc, bringing together elements of learning from across the course.Optional modules:Plus up to three optional modules from a selection, which in recent years have included:\nSurveys, Survey Experiments, and AnalysisCommunicating Quantitative Evidence: Visualisations, Narratives and TablesAdvanced Topics in Public PolicyMaking the Leap from Evidence to PolicyNatural Language Processing for Public PolicyThe Politics of the European UnionGlobal Governance\nCreate Your Own Prospectus\r\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n            Explore Our Scholarships\r\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n            Meet Our Students\r\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n            Book an Open Day\nCreate Your Own Prospectus\nCreate Your Own Prospectus\nCreate Your Own Prospectus\nExplore Our Scholarships\nExplore Our Scholarships\nExplore Our Scholarships\nMeet Our Students\nMeet Our Students\nMeet Our Students\nBook an Open Day\nBook an Open Day\nBook an Open Day\nLearning\r\n  \n\nTeaching is centred around the School of Government and International Affairs, a vibrant learning community and home to multiple research centres and institutes. \nPostgraduate taught modules are delivered via smaller group seminars, allowing you to further explore the subject through critical discussion with peers and larger lectures that provide grounding in each topic. Our data analysis topics will often involve computer room tuition for hands-on opportunities to consider how data can be used to inform us about particular policy challenges. The core module Public Policy includes a simulation, during which students can showcase their skills at navigating the policy process. \nThe capstone project provides a valuable opportunity to apply these skills as part of a team to support one of several government organisations, private businesses, or NGOs in using their data to better understand policy problems, challenges, or evaluate how a new policy may change their own practice. \nThe MSc dissertation makes up a significant proportion of your course. To support you in this, you will be appointed a dissertation supervisor based on a broad match with your dissertation topic. Your supervisor will provide personalised support and one-to-one meetings at all stages of the dissertation process. AssessmentOur assessment methods allow you to showcase what you have learned, and align with what you might do in your future career. Throughout the course, you will craft policy briefs, analyse data, produce reports, and collaborate in a group for the capstone project. All students will participate in a simulation, showcasing skills in problem-solving and navigating the policy process.\nDepending on the modules studied, assessments may include policy briefs, simulations, exams, data exercises, and essays. The variety of methods is designed to demonstrate a well-rounded evaluation of your knowledge and skills.\nThe course culminates in a 10,000-word dissertation which is conducted and written up as an independent piece of work with support from your appointed supervisor. The dissertation is worth one-third of your final mark.\n\n \n\n\r\n    Entry requirements\r\n  \n\n2:1 UK undergraduate degree, or equivalent, in any social science.

As part of its commitment to enhancing the applicant experience, this procedure has been established to deal with complaints from applicants in a fair and transparent manner. The University recognises that complaints may provide useful feedback from applicants and, where appropriate, will be used to improve the admissions process.\nThese procedures explain how applicants to undergraduate and postgraduate programmes may make a complaint, both informal and formal. Applicants who have a complaint to make should raise it as soon as possible, as matters that are dealt with informally at an early stage have the best chance of being resolved effectively. Only when the informal procedures have been exhausted and the applicant remains dissatisfied should a formal complaint be made.\nPlease note:\nFormal complaints can only be made once an application has been submitted to the University.\nComplaints about the Durham University International Study Centre (DUISC) should not be made using this process and should instead be made to Study Group\nIf you have any questions about our Admissions Policies, please ask us.\nTel: +44 (0)191 334 1000\nThe Palatine CentreDurham UniversityStockton RoadDurhamDH1 3LE\n• Notification of Academic and Personal Details for Admission, Matriculation and Registration Purposes\n• Regulations for Undergraduate Matriculation\n• Regulations for Postgraduate Matriculation\n• Policy for applicants under 18\n• Student Protection Plan\n• Criminal Convictions Policy\n• Complaints Procedure for Applicants\n• Applicant Complaint Form\n• Guidance for completing the Complaint Form\n• Code of Practice on behaviour in Admissions Complaints\n• Ask Us\n[GRID_TABLE]\nAdmissions Policy\nAdmissions Policy\nOur Admissions Policies\r\n        \nOur Admissions Policies are based on the core principles of fairness, transparency, consistency and operating a professional admissions process. \n\n\r\n          Our aim is to operate a fair and transparent admissions process to select the most able and motivated applicants who can best benefit from a Durham University education.
