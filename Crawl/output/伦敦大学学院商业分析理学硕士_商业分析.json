These entry requirements apply to all our Teacher Training PGCE courses.\nA first or second-class UK Bachelor’s degree in an appropriate subject, or an overseas qualification of an equivalent standard from a recognised higher education institution is normally required.\nCandidates who are judged not to have sufficient subject knowledge for certain secondary PGCE courses may be required to undertake a Subject Knowledge Enhancement (SKE) course. The length of SKE varies depending on the need of the individual – from eight-week ‘refresher’ or ‘booster’ courses, through to more extensive 36-week courses.\nFor some courses, applicants whose degree qualifications are lower than 2:2 standard may be admitted if they can demonstrate an appropriate academic background at master’s level and above and/or significant postgraduate experience in the relevant field.\nPlease note that we will not consider applicants to any Initial Teacher Education (ITE) programmes that already hold the professional teaching qualification that the intended UCL PGCE programme leads to - QTS, QTLS, EYTS. For example, an applicant who already holds Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) is ineligible to apply for any ITE course that leads to QTS.\nFor all courses, a GCSE, or comparable qualification, at grade C or 4 is required in English Language and Mathematics.\nFor Primary education, (pupils aged 3–11) and Early Years Initial Teacher Training (EYITT) working with children aged 0-5; a GCSE grade C or 4 is also required in a science subject (we do not accept Additional Science or Applied Science). Please note that the PGCE Primary (Specialist Mathematics) course requires a GCSE grade 5 in Mathematics.\nWe do not accept English taught as a second language or English Literature to meet our GCSE English Language requirements.\nWe do not accept BTEC, functional skills or Access qualifications in place of GCSEs.\nApplicants who do not offer a GCSE in English Language or Mathematics at grade 4 may demonstrate an equivalent standard by completing either the Mathematics Foundation, Mathematics Higher or English from Equivalency Testing or A Star Equivalency and achieve at least a grade 4.\nFor GCSE Science we will accept either Combined Science or Biology taken with one of these providers.\nIf you are made an offer you will be required to successfully complete Occupational Health and Disclosure Barring Service (DBS) Enhanced Disclosure checks.\nFrom October 2024, the Occupational Health Check is £100 and, depending on your DBS requirements, there may be an additional fee between £12.75 to £25.50, depending on the number of documents checked, if you submit your DBS Enhanced Disclosure check via a UK Post Office.\nAll teacher training candidates who are offered a place at UCL must be certified as meeting national requirements for physical and mental fitness to teach, as set by the Department for Education. We apply the Fitness to Teach requirement to all our PGCE candidates who must complete a health questionnaire for scrutiny by our occupational health provider.\nIf you are offered a place on a teacher training courses, you will be asked to apply for an Enhanced, Child-workforce, fee paid Disclosure certificate from the Disclosure Barring Service (DBS). A satisfactory certificate is a condition of entry to the course, as we need to assess your suitability for access to children and vulnerable adults. This document will contain details of any cautions, convictions, reprimands, warnings or bindovers recorded against your name (even where they would ordinarily be considered spent) or confirm that you have none.\nIf the ITE Admissions team is able to confirm that you hold a DBS certificate valid for entry to a UCL PGCE course, which is also registered with the DBS Update Service, you will not be required to complete a new DBS check linked to UCL. If you do not have a valid DBS Update Service subscription then you will need to complete a new DBS linked to UCL. Maintaining a subscription to the DBS Update Service throughout the PGCE course is recommended.\nIf you have lived, worked, studied or travelled in any single country outside of the UK for six continuous months or more, in the last five years, you will be required to obtain a Certificate of Good Conduct from the relevant country/countries. Please note that absences of less than six weeks, from a country outside of the UK are not considered as a break in residency. Please note that the police check should be applied for within one month of your departure date to ensure the police certificate issued covers the period you were in a country.\nPossession of a criminal record will not necessarily bar you from entry to your chosen course of study. If your disclosure certificate reveals details about an offence or other matter, we will ask you to provide a brief written account of the circumstances of the incident(s) and any mitigating factors that you feel are relevant, in order to make an informed decision on your suitability for admission. Please refer to our policy statement on the recruitment of ex-offenders.\nFurther information about the Enhanced Disclosure check will be provided in our offer letter, if your application to UCL is successful.\nStudents who are enrolled on an initial teacher training course at UCL which will involve a placement with a primary school or setting in its later years provision and/or early years provision (nursery and reception classes) need to be aware of the requirements of the following:\nAccording to the above legislation, it is an offence for a student teacher who is disqualified from working in early years childcare or relevant later years childcare to do so or to be directly involved in the management of such provision. Please see our guidance document for more information on the grounds for disqualification.\nBoth the Act and Regulations mean that we will ask offer holders for certain UCL courses to provide a self-declaration form to UCL.\nEarly years childcare includes any supervised activity for a young child which takes place on a school’s premises during or outside of the normal school day.  A child is considered a ‘young child’ for the period up to 1 September after their 5th birthday.  Any teaching placements in nursery and reception classes will be classed as early years childcare.\nLater years childcare includes provision by a school for children who are not in early years but who are under the age of 8, which takes place on a school’s premises outside of the normal school day. This includes wraparound care before and after the school day, such as breakfast clubs and after school care. It does not include teaching during the school day or extended school hours for co-curricular activities such as sports activities.\nWe have set out below what this means for your application depending on which teacher training course you have applied to study on.\nIf you are offered a place on the above courses, including through the IOE Lead Partner Direct route, you will be required to submit a self-declaration form before you enrol. This form will ask you to declare whether you have been disqualified from a childcare role. More information on how to complete and submit this form will be sent to all successful applicants.\nYour employer will be responsible for making sure that you are not disqualified from a childcare role.\nIf you are offered a place on the above courses, including through the IOE Lead Partner Direct route, you will be required to sign a declaration confirming that you have read the information regarding childcare disqualification and return this to UCL. More information on how to complete and submit this form will be sent to all successful applicants.\nIf you are a successful applicant who is then placed in a nursery or reception class you will be asked to complete the childcare disqualification declaration before you go on placement. This will ask you to declare whether you have been disqualified from working in a childcare role. If, at this stage, it becomes clear that any of the disqualification criteria apply to you then UCL will ensure that you are not placed in an early years childcare placement.\nIf any of the disqualification criteria apply to you and you will be undertaking a placement in early years childcare as part of your UCL initial teacher training course, then you will not be able to enrol on your initial teacher training course at UCL unless you have a waiver from Ofsted before the commencement of the course.\nThe disqualified individual must apply for the waiver from Ofsted themselves. For more information, please see the guidance issued by Ofsted.\nAll EYITT, Primary and Secondary Trainees will be assured against a set of fundamental Mathematics and English skills by the end of their teacher training.\nSchool experience is not a mandatory entry requirement for our PGCE courses. For this reason, you do not need to have completed school experience prior to applying. However, we tend to find that applicants with experience perform better if invited to interview and we would therefore recommend that you endeavour to gain experience as soon as it becomes practical to do so. If you have future experience already arranged, please be sure to mention this in your application.\nThe English language level for teacher training programmes is UCL Level 2.\nUCL requires two suitable references.\nIt is expected that one of your references will be academic and from someone who has taught you at degree level, unless you have been out of higher education for more than five years.\nAs two references are required, you may provide one professional reference in place of the second academic reference.\nYou will be asked to enter the details of your referees in your application form. Your referees will be sent an email asking them to write a reference for you and to submit it online. For EYITT PGCE applicants, referees will be contacted as soon as the application is submitted. For all other PGCE programmes, referees will be contacted when you accept your conditional offer.\nPlease ensure you have spoken to your chosen referees so that they are expecting the invitation and are happy to provide a reference for you online.\nWhen providing the email address for your referee, where possible please use an academic or professional address rather than a personal address, e.g. [john.smith@university.ac.uk] rather than [johnsmith@hotmail.com].

Get in touch.\n[HEADING] Prospective student enquiries\n[HEADING] Prospective Students Graduate\nEarly Years Initial Teacher Training (EYITT) courses are designed for those already working with, or those seeking to work with, babies and children from birth to five years old.\nParticipants will leave the courses as reflective practitioners, fostering positive relationships with parents, carers and children, as well as with other professionals. There are two routes, both of 12 months’ duration: mainstream and employment based.\nEarly Years teachers can work in all private, voluntary and independent (PVI) early years settings, as well as free schools, academies and independent schools which can employ teaching staff without the requirement for QTS.\nMainstream route\nSuitable for new graduates and career changers who will not be employed in an early years setting during the training.\nEmployment based route\nFor people already employed in an early years setting or phase of a school.

Tuition fees are subject to an annual increase of up to 5% annually (except for Overseas UG fees and all PG Taught fees which are now fixed at the rate at entry), which should be accounted for when you are applying for a programme.\nFees are normally quoted at the full-time rate, except where the programme is offered part-time or modular/flexible only. Fees for part-time or modular study are normally charged pro-rata to the appropriate full-time Master's fee taken in an academic session. Most fees are quoted in GBP, but some are in other currencies.\nUCL's tuition fees are set annually and cover registration, tuition and supervision for each academic year, or part of the academic year that you are enrolled.

Fees for part-time or modular study are normally charged pro-rata to the appropriate full-time Master's fee taken in an academic session. Most fees are quoted in UK Pounds but some are in other currencies.\nDetails about fees for individual programmes can be found on the specific programme information pages.\nResearch programmes at UCL may be subject to an Additional Fee Element (AFE). The AFE is applied to cover additional costs related to consumables, equipment and materials and other items (excluding student visas) which are not included in the composite tuition fee listed in the fees schedule and is, therefore, applied to a minority of programmes.\nAs each PhD programme is unique in its nature, the AFE is calculated on a student by student basis and is determined by the supervisor. The AFE is banded into four fixed amounts: £1,000, £2,500, £5,000 and £10,000, with one further band for variable sums over £10,000. Please contact your supervisor directly for advice on whether or not your programme will incur an AFE. Please note that you will be informed in your offer letter of any AFE you will be required to pay.\nAt some UK institutions the AFE may be referred to as bench fees.\nThe level of tuition fee charged will also depend on whether you are classified as a UK or Overseas student. It is likely that you will already know into which category you will fall, but this will be confirmed if you are offered a place to study at UCL. Your fee classification plays no part in deciding whether or not to offer you a place to study at UCL.\nEach student's fee classification is determined in accordance with the 2007 Education (Fees and Awards) (England) Regulations (SI No. 779) and subsequent amendments, and is based upon information that you have provided on your application.\nFor full-time and part-time students your tuition fee will normally be quoted on your offer letter. For flexible/modular students, fees will be assessed according to the number of credits selected, therefore a fee will not be quoted on your offer letter.\nYou must pay at least 1/3 of your tuition fee before or at enrolment to be fully enrolled, or provide a letter of sponsorship indicating who should be invoiced for your fee.\nStudents can pay in three equal instalments; the first before or at enrolment, the second by 7 February and the third by 2 May. No charge is made for paying in instalments, and no more than three instalments are permitted. No discount is offered for paying in full at the start of your programme.\nUCL requires successful applicants to postgraduate taught programmes to pay a tuition fee deposit.\nFor Full-time and Part-time offer holders a fee deposit will be charged at 10% of the first year fee.\nFor flexible/modular offer holders a £500 fee deposit will be charged.\nThere is usually no fee deposit required for PG Dip and PG Cert applicants.\nPayment of the deposit allows applicants to demonstrate their commitment to attending their chosen programme of study at UCL and aids UCL in its student number planning. Once a successful applicant is enrolled on their programme of study, the deposit will form part of the total tuition fee, as quoted on the offer of admission.\nPlease note that the required tuition fee deposit must be paid in full by the deadline specified in the offer of admission, which will usually be no earlier than 1 April for entry the following September.\nSome programmes will have earlier deadlines and you should consult your offer letter for the deadline which applies to you.\nPlease take time to read UCL's tuition fee deposit policy. Payment of the tuition fee deposit (in full or in part) will be considered as acceptance of the terms detailed in the policy.\nFind out all you need to know about tuition fee deposits for postgraduate study with our frequently asked questions.\nFind out all you need to know about our tuition fee deposits policy for 2025 entry.\nThe UK has now formally left the EU. Students from the EU, EEA and Switzerland who start their programme of study in 2021 or later will no longer be eligible for the UK (Home) fee status and will pay fees at the Overseas rate.\n• Graduate degrees\n• Taught degrees Taught Degrees\nApplying for Graduate Taught Study at UCL\n• Taught degrees\n• Taught Degrees\n• Applying for Graduate Taught Study at UCL\n• Taught degrees\n• Taught Degrees\n• Applying for Graduate Taught Study at UCL\n• Research degrees\n• Research Degrees\n• Funded Research Opportunities\n• Doctoral School\n• Funded Doctoral Training Programmes\n• Applying for Graduate Research Study at UCL\n• Teacher training\n• Teacher Training\n• Early Years PGCE courses\n• Primary PGCE courses\n• Secondary PGCE courses\n• Further Education PGCE programme\n• Entry requirements\n• How to apply\n• The IOE approach\n• Teacher training in the heart of London\n• Why choose UCL?\n• Why choose UCL?\n• Entrepreneurship\n• Inspiring facilities and resources\n• Careers and employability\n• UCL Impact\n• Your global alumni community\n• Your wellbeing\n• Postgraduate Students' Association\n• Your life in London\n• Your life in London\n• Accommodation\n[GRID_TABLE]\nHome \n\n\nTuition fees\nFinancial matters are a concern for all students and careful planning is important.

Please contact your supervisor directly for advice on whether or not your programme will incur an AFE. Please note that you will be informed in your offer letter of any AFE you will be required to pay.At some UK institutions the AFE may be referred to as bench fees.\nTuition fee classification  \n  \nThe level of tuition fee charged will also depend on whether you are classified as a UK or Overseas student. It is likely that you will already know into which category you will fall, but this will be confirmed if you are offered a place to study at UCL. Your fee classification plays no part in deciding whether or not to offer you a place to study at UCL.Each student's fee classification is determined in accordance with the 2007 Education (Fees and Awards) (England) Regulations (SI No. 779) and subsequent amendments, and is based upon information that you have provided on your application.\nRead more on student fees and funding\nPaying your tuition fee   \n  \nFor full-time and part-time students your tuition fee will normally be quoted on your offer letter. For flexible/modular students, fees will be assessed according to the number of credits selected, therefore a fee will not be quoted on your offer letter.You must pay at least 1/3 of your tuition fee before or at enrolment to be fully enrolled, or provide a letter of sponsorship indicating who should be invoiced for your fee.Students can pay in three equal instalments; the first before or at enrolment, the second by 7 February and the third by 2 May. No charge is made for paying in instalments, and no more than three instalments are permitted. No discount is offered for paying in full at the start of your programme.\nTuition fee deposits  \n  \nUCL requires successful applicants to postgraduate taught programmes to pay a tuition fee deposit.For Full-time and Part-time offer holders a fee deposit will be charged at 10% of the first year fee.For flexible/modular offer holders a £500 fee deposit will be charged.There is usually no fee deposit required for PG Dip and PG Cert applicants.Payment of the deposit allows applicants to demonstrate their commitment to attending their chosen programme of study at UCL and aids UCL in its student number planning. Once a successful applicant is enrolled on their programme of study, the deposit will form part of the total tuition fee, as quoted on the offer of admission.Please note that the required tuition fee deposit must be paid in full by the deadline specified in the offer of admission, which will usually be no earlier than 1 April for entry the following September.Some programmes will have earlier deadlines and you should consult your offer letter for the deadline which applies to you.Please take time to read UCL's tuition fee deposit policy. Payment of the tuition fee deposit (in full or in part) will be considered as acceptance of the terms detailed in the policy.\nSee all programmes that do not require a tuition fee deposit\nFee deposit FAQs  \n  \nFind out all you need to know about tuition fee deposits for postgraduate study with our frequently asked questions.\nRead our fee deposit FAQs\nTuition fee deposits policy   \n  \nFind out all you need to know about our tuition fee deposits policy for 2025 entry.\nRead our tuition fee deposits policy\nA note for EU students  \n  \nThe UK has now formally left the EU.
