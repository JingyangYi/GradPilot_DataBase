They build your skills in research and communication, encouraging you to adopt strategies for gathering and organising information, analysing complex evidence, evaluating propositions and articulating arguments for different audiences. As well as pursuing independent research, you will work with fellow students to coordinate and participate in a research colloquium.\nYou will choose from optional modules focused around the literary, documentary, visual and material culture of ancient Greece and Rome. These modules shed light on the lived experiences of people in Classical antiquity.\nAdditional options in Classical and Near Eastern Archaeology allow you to expand beyond Greece and Rome to the Mediterranean and the Near East, and to work with objects in our Garstang Museum collection. You can develop skills in ancient Greek or Latin language. You may also apply to study abroad at the British School of Athens or the British School of Rome as an accredited part of your degree.\nThis variety allows you to tailor the MA to suit your interests, and prepares you for completing a dissertation on the agreed topic of your choice.\nThe programme is designed for graduates in Classics, Classical Studies, Classical Civilisation, Ancient History and other relevant disciplines who wish to broaden and deepen their understanding of the Classical Greco-Roman world and its legacy.\nDiscover what you'll learn, what you'll study, and how you'll be taught and assessed.\nOn the Classics and Ancient History MA full-time programme you take 30 credits of required modules and two optional modules totalling 30 credits in each semester.\nRegistration onto language modules is determined by ability level.\nNot all combinations of optional modules are possible.

Independent study is carried out alongside this via producing a written portfolio. This work enables you to strengthen your research skills and topic-specific knowledge, whilst building key employability skills associated with team work and developing practice-based understanding of event organization.\nOptional modules in Classical and Near Eastern Archaeology offer sessions in handling and evaluating archaeological remains.\nIn years when they are running, full-time students may apply to attend a residential postgraduate course at the British Schools of Athens (CLAH898) or Rome (CLAH899). Places on the courses are awarded by the schools on academic merit.  Successful applicants receive practical skills training and develop knowledge and understanding of an aspect of ancient Greece or Rome, and benefit from the expertise, resources and facilities available at an international institute for advanced research.\nOptional ancient Greek or Latin language modules involve frequent contact sessions (two or three per week). The different language modules available cater for different levels of prior knowledge, therefore those at complete beginner to advanced levels will be supported in language learning.\nYou are continually supported in your dissertation work by a dissertation supervisor, who will discuss progress and offer feedback on draft writing.\nAssessments are fundamentally research-based; they require students to identify and marshal resources, evaluate and analyse evidence from critically informed perspectives, and to develop robust arguments. This is achieved through a varied portfolio of assessment activities depending on the module.\nThe optional modules: ‘Truth and Lies’ (CLAH851), ‘Spaces and Places’ (CLAH853), ‘The Body’ (CLAH852) and ‘Praise and Blame’ (CLAH858) require you to complete a 5,000 word essay on a research project. This assessment assists in building towards the longer 15-20,000 word required Dissertation.  Optional modules in Classical and Near Eastern Archaeology involve similar essay assessments, plus other assessment tasks such archaeological reports and catalogues.\nOptional ancient languages modules involve unseen exams (with a dictionary) to assess linguistic competence and comprehension.  From intermediate language level onwards, these are balanced with critical exercises and commentaries to assess interpretation and translation, which include a research component. The language modules are the only modules on the course to assess via exam.\nRequired modules in Research Skills and Methodologies introduce a range of other activities through which research can be presented and reflected upon in other formats, including blogs, journals, posters, and oral presentations.  These varied assessments engage you with the techniques of research appropriate to your subject specialisms whilst familiarising you with different communication strategies and technologies.  Through the diverse assessment approach of the programme you are therefore provided with preparation for further research and enhanced employability.\nWe have a distinctive approach to education, the Liverpool Curriculum Framework, which focuses on research-connected teaching, active learning, and authentic assessment to ensure our students graduate as digitally fluent and confident global citizens.\nThe Liverpool Curriculum framework sets out our distinctive approach to education.

session support from your dissertation supervisor.\nWithin the core module ‘Research Event’ (CLAH854) you will work together with fellow students to articulate a research question and pursue it through organizing, participating in and reflecting on a research event, or colloquium. Independent study is carried out alongside this via producing a written portfolio. This work enables you to strengthen your research skills and topic-specific knowledge, whilst building key employability skills associated with team work and developing practice-based understanding of event organization.\nOptional modules in Classical and Near Eastern Archaeology offer sessions in handling and evaluating archaeological remains.\nIn years when they are running, full-time students may apply to attend a residential postgraduate course at the British Schools of Athens (CLAH898) or Rome (CLAH899). Places on the courses are awarded by the schools on academic merit.  Successful applicants receive practical skills training and develop knowledge and understanding of an aspect of ancient Greece or Rome, and benefit from the expertise, resources and facilities available at an international institute for advanced research.\nOptional ancient Greek or Latin language modules involve frequent contact sessions (two or three per week). The different language modules available cater for different levels of prior knowledge, therefore those at complete beginner to advanced levels will be supported in language learning.\nYou are continually supported in your dissertation work by a dissertation supervisor, who will discuss progress and offer feedback on draft writing.\nHow you're assessed\nAssessments are fundamentally research-based; they require students to identify and marshal resources, evaluate and analyse evidence from critically informed perspectives, and to develop robust arguments. This is achieved through a varied portfolio of assessment activities depending on the module.\nThe optional modules: ‘Truth and Lies’ (CLAH851), ‘Spaces and Places’ (CLAH853), ‘The Body’ (CLAH852) and ‘Praise and Blame’ (CLAH858) require you to complete a 5,000 word essay on a research project. This assessment assists in building towards the longer 15-20,000 word required Dissertation.  Optional modules in Classical and Near Eastern Archaeology involve similar essay assessments, plus other assessment tasks such archaeological reports and catalogues.\nOptional ancient languages modules involve unseen exams (with a dictionary) to assess linguistic competence and comprehension.  From intermediate language level onwards, these are balanced with critical exercises and commentaries to assess interpretation and translation, which include a research component. The language modules are the only modules on the course to assess via exam.\nRequired modules in Research Skills and Methodologies introduce a range of other activities through which research can be presented and reflected upon in other formats, including blogs, journals, posters, and oral presentations.  These varied assessments engage you with the techniques of research appropriate to your subject specialisms whilst familiarising you with different communication strategies and technologies.  Through the diverse assessment approach of the programme you are therefore provided with preparation for further research and enhanced employability.\nLiverpool Hallmarks\nWe have a distinctive approach to education, the Liverpool Curriculum Framework, which focuses on research-connected teaching, active learning, and authentic assessment to ensure our students graduate as digitally fluent and confident global citizens.\nThe Liverpool Curriculum framework sets out our distinctive approach to education.
