Novel treatments are required to meet this challenge as the efficacy of antimicrobial interventions, including the potency of vaccines, continues to decline. The discovery of novel preventative and therapeutic interventions are now critically dependent upon a detailed mechanistic understanding of disease processes, their impact upon human pathobiology and the feasibility of therapeutically targeting such mechanisms.\nWith a view to training a generation of infection biologists equipped with the skills to tackle this global challenge, the MSc in Infection Biology provides outstanding academic and research training in the molecular and cellular basis of host-microbe interactions in health and disease.\nYou will learn directly from internationally recognised scientists through joint research, thereby securing a sustained interaction with expert mentors for the duration of the course. The course provides research training in fundamental aspects of infectious diseases, microbial (viral, bacterial, helminth and fungal) pathogenesis, host interactions, antimicrobial immunity, and antimicrobial therapy. For the talented student this course provides an excellent training prior to registration for a PhD.\nThis course will equip you with:\nFollow us on our dedicated       Twitter page\n for updates from the course team.\nPhD with integrated master's\nIf you're planning to undertake a PhD after your master's, our       Integrated PhD programme\n will enable you to combine your postgraduate taught course with a related PhD project in biology, medicine or health.\nYou can also visit this page for       examples of projects\n related to integrated master's courses.\nVisit       The Lydia Becker Institute of Immunology and Inflammation\n to find out more about immunology research at The University of Manchester.\nThis course aims to:\nThe course comprises an induction period, sessions to introduce research areas and fundamental background knowledge, two linked research projects (initial literature research and proposal development, followed by a minimum of 25 weeks related laboratory research).\nLecture unit: Host-Microbe Interactions in Health and Disease\nThe unit aims to provide you with in depth, up to date understanding of the molecular basis of host-pathogen interactions in healthy and diseased settings. Specifically, the mechanisms by which bacteria, fungi, viruses, parasites are able to colonise and establish infections will be addressed as well the pathogen/host interactions that subvert/modify the ability of the host to respond to infections. Microbial pathogenesis will be explored, illustrated by studying selected infections in detail that will serve as illustrative paradigms relating to the wider field. Therapeutic, diagnostics and vaccination strategies will be explored, as well as epidemiology and clinical presentation of relevant diseases.\nTechnologies workshops\nThese will provide practical training in advanced research methods, giving you exposure to techniques which you may otherwise not be exposed to through your projects. Each session will be led by an expert and will consist of an explanation of the technique, followed by a practical demonstration including, where relevant, hands-on experience and data analysis.\nJournal clubs\nIn these sessions, you will meet to review and discuss relevant research papers. Each session will be led by a senior researcher who will suggest papers for discussion.\nResearch seminars\nYou will be expected to attend departmental seminar programmes. This will include presentations provided by external speakers.\nResearch projects\nYou will complete one extended research project during the year, designed to give you practical experience of laboratory research. The experience gained will help you develop and focus your research skills in modern biomedical research laboratories. Research projects will be written up and formally evaluated. Upon commencing the course you will be issued with a list of potential research projects and appropriate reading material.\nThe lecture unit will include presentations from research groups that describe the breadth of research opportunities available, and will be able to discuss projects with potential supervisors.\nGrant writing exercise\nThe grant writing exercise will provide hands-on experience of the grant writing process from the initial idea to the submission and peer review of the proposal.\nThe course unit details given below are subject to change, and are the latest example of the curriculum available on this course of study.\nThe Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health provides a range of       research facilities\n to help researchers in the Faculty to carry out ground-breaking work in biological, medical and health sciences.\nThe University of Manchester offers extensive       library and online services\n to help you get the most out of your studies.\n• View tabs\n• View full page\n• a detailed theoretical and practical understanding of molecular microbiology and antimicrobial immunology;\n• a thorough understanding of methods for analysing the biological functions and physiological relevance of microbial virulence factors and host responses to pathogenic challenge;\n• a working knowledge of mechanistic approaches to problem-solving in molecular and cellular biomedical science;\n• an understanding of a wide repertoire of cutting edge scientific methods including flow cytometry, single cell technologies, next generation sequencing, imaging and proteomics;\n• transferable skills in critical reasoning and reflection, collaborative team working, scientific communication, use of IT/health informatics, innovation in the application of knowledge to practice and logical/systematic approaches to solving problems and making decisions.\n• equip you with a detailed theoretical and practical understanding of molecular microbiology and immunology, delivered in-context during laboratory-based research and self-directed research of the literature;\n• ensure you have a working understanding of the application of a wide repertoire of advanced scientific methods at the cutting edge of scientific research and diagnostics, including flow cytometry, single cell technologies, imaging, next generation sequencing and proteomics;\n• enable you to integrate molecular and cellular information to understand the genetic basis of microbial virulence, host responses to pathogen challenge, the complexity of infectious disease, diagnostics, antimicrobial therapies and antimicrobial resistance;\n• give you an understanding of the principles of modelling of host and microbial aspects of infection to help characterise the host-pathogen interaction;\n• equip you with an understanding of methods for analysing the biological functions and physiological relevance of microbial virulence factors and host responses to pathogenic challenge;\n• provide you with a working knowledge of mechanistic approaches to problem-solving in molecular and cellular biomedical science;\n• give you transferable skills in critical reasoning and reflection, collaborative team working, communication, use of IT/health informatics, innovation in the application of knowledge to practice and logical/systematic approaches to solving problems and making decisions.\n• In our unique technology workshops you will learn how to harness modern research and diagnostic technologies including single cell methodologies, live cell imaging, CRISPR, flow cytometry, proteomics, and next generation sequencing to address cutting-edge questions in infectious diseases research.\n• You will learn from clinician scientists and global leaders in infectious diseases, diagnostic and drug discovery research, by attending our fortnightly seminars in infection.\n• In our grant writing unit, you will learn how to budget for, and become competitive in, securing funding for scientific research programmes.\n• You will receive direct one-to-one support from infectious disease experts during a 5 month project.\n[HTML_TABLE]\nTitle | Code | Credit rating | Mandatory/optional\nResearch Project 1 | BIOL66121 | 30 | Mandatory\nResearch Project 2 | BIOL66132 | 90 | Mandatory\nTechnologies Workshops | BIOL68911 | 15 | Mandatory\nHost-pathogen interactions in health and disease | BIOL68921 | 15 | Mandatory\nJournal Club Tutorial Unit | BIOL68931 | 15 | Mandatory\nGrant Application Writing | BIOL68942 | 15 | Mandatory\nResearch Methods (Non-Credit) | MEDN69920 | 0 | Mandatory\n[GRID_TABLE]\nAttend an open day\nDownload our course brochure\nDiscover more about Biosciences",
