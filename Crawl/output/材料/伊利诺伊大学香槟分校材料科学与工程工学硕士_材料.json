      "content": "[HEADING] Print Options\nfor the degree of Master of Engineering in Materials Engineering\nThis program is not accepting applications for academic year(s) 2022-2027.\nAdmission\nStudents with bachelor's or master's degrees in the natural sciences or engineering will be considered for admission if they have a grade point average of at least 3.00 (A = 4.00) for the last two years of undergraduate study. The general test of the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) is required. Admission is possible for the spring semester, but most admissions are for the fall semester. Full details of admission requirements are on the department's graduate admissions Web site.\nAll applicants whose native language is not English must submit a minimum TOEFL score of 104 (iBT), 257 (CBT), or 613 (PBT); or minimum International English Language Testing System (IELTS) academic exam scores of 7.5 overall and 6.0 in all subsections. Applicants may be exempt from the TOEFL if certain criteria are met. Full admission status is granted for those taking the TOEFL or IELTS since the scores required for admission to MatSE are above the minimum scores demonstrating an acceptable level of English language proficiency.\nFor the M.Eng. degree program students must have had a B.S. degree in MatSE or a related field (e.g., B.S. degrees in Metallurgy, Polymers or Ceramics, or with concentrations in Materials Chemistry, Condensed Matter Physics, etc.). Students in the program are not expected to continue in and do not have automatic admission to the Ph.D. program in MatSE. The M.Eng. degree is a professional degree.\nFinancial Aid\nFinancial aid is available in the form of research assistantships, teaching assistantships, and partial fellowships for students in the Ph.D. programs. Except for special circumstances, MatSE does not provide financial aid to students in the M.S. and M.Eng. programs. All applicants, regardless of U.S. citizenship, whose native language is not English and who wish to be considered for teaching assistantships must demonstrate spoken English language proficiency by achieving a minimum score of 50 on the Test of Spoken English (TSE), 24 on the speaking subsection of the TOEFL iBT, or 8 on the speaking subsection of the IELTS. For students who are unable to take the TSE, iBT, or IELTS, a minimum score of 4CP is required on the EPI test, offered on campus. All new teaching assistants are required to participate in the Graduate Academy for College Teaching conducted prior to the start of the semester.\nThe Department of Materials Science & Engineering (MatSE) offers graduate programs leading to degrees of Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy in Materials Science & Engineering. The department is consistently ranked among the top programs in the nation (undergraduate and graduate) by U.S. News and World Report. It offers opportunities to specialize in Nanoscale Science and Technology, Materials for Energy and the Environment, Materials for Medicine, and Mechanical Properties and Materials for Extreme Conditions with strong research programs in all of the areas.\nFor additional details and requirements, please refer to the department's Graduate Degree Requirements Handbook and the Graduate College Handbook.\nOther Requirements and Conditions\nStudents who are admitted to the M. Eng. program are responsible for finding a suitable internship. Department or college staff may be able to help students in their search for a suitable placement suitable internship but the department does not guarantee a placement. The MSE 585 internship requires approval by the departmental Director of Graduate Studies to insure that it matches the student’s individual career objectives and meets the learning goals of the program. Students taking an internship as part of their undergraduate B.S program should also check with the Director of Graduate Studies; his/her approval is required if the student is already accepted in the combined B.S./M.Eng. Program. Students returning to the university after having had materials engineering employment experience, if it is deemed appropriate, may use that as their internship and base their report on that experience\nMaterials Science & Engineering\nDepartment Head: Nancy Sottos\nAssociate Head of Graduate Programs: Moonsub Shim\nMaterials Science & Engineering website\nMaterials Science & Engineering faculty\nGraduate Programs in Materials Science & Engineering\nGraduate Program Contact: Ashley Phillips Smith\n201 Materials Science and Engineering Bldg, 1304 W Green St, Urbana, IL 61801\n(217) 333-1441\nMaterials Science & Engineering email\nGrainger College of Engineering\nGrainger College of Engineering website\nAdmissions\nMaterials Science & Engineering Admissions\nGraduate College Admissions & Requirements\nSend Page to Printer\nPrint this page.\nDownload Page (PDF)\nThe PDF will include all information unique to this page.\n2025-2026 Catalog (PDF)\nA copy of the full 2025-2026 catalog.\n• The ability of students to function as independent scientists and engineers.\n• A deep understanding of the underlying principles of the appropriate theories in their subject area.\n• A deep understanding of the underlying principles of the synthesis and preparation of their subject materials.\n• A deep understanding of the underlying principles of characterization of their subject materials.\n• A deep understanding of the underlying principles of processing of their subject materials.\n• A deep understanding of interrelationships of structure, processing and properties of their subject materials.\n• A broad knowledge of the preparation, characterization and processing of all types of materials.\n• Send Page to Printer\nPrint this page.\n• Download Page (PDF)The PDF will include all information unique to this page.\n• 2025-2026 Catalog (PDF)A copy of the full 2025-2026 catalog.\n[HTML_TABLE]\nCode | Title | Hours\nMSE 492 | Lab Safety Fundamentals (credit does not apply toward the degree) | 0\nMSE 585 | Materials Engrg Practicum (The equivalent of two semesters of industrial internships or co-ops (30 weeks total; one of the semesters can be during the B.S. program or prior to enrollment).) | 2\nTwo MSE area specialty courses in the student’s chosen area of specialization. | 6\nMSE area specialty courses in one area outside the student’s chosen area of specialization (subject to Other Requirements and Conditions below) | 3-6\nTechnical elective course - Chosen from list appropriate for the student's area of specialization | 3\nElective courses – At least 10 hours of these elective courses shall be College of Engineering courses in one or more of the areas of business, technology management, and entrepreneurship as listed on an approved list available from the department.

All scores must be dated within two years of the beginning of the proposed admission term. Acceptable tests and corresponding minimum scores are available below.\nApplicants who meet one of the following criteria are exempt from the English proficiency requirement for admission:\nIllinois Graduate Admissions recognizes the following countries as having English as the primary language: Australia, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Bermuda, Canada, Dominica, Fiji, Gambia, Ghana, Grenada, Guyana, Ireland, Jamaica, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, New Zealand, Nigeria, Philippines, Scotland, Sierra Leone, Singapore, South Africa, St. Kitts, Trinidad & Tobago, Uganda, United Kingdom, United States, and Zimbabwe.\nPlease note that all English proficiency requirements and exemptions listed above are for admission purposes only. Admissions minimums are not equivalent to minimums required for holding a teaching assistantship; and not all exemptions apply for those holding a teaching assistantship.\nInternational students who wish to be considered for a Teaching Assistantship are required to submit the results of an accepted test as evidence of spoken English language proficiency. University policy regarding appointing non-native English speaking teaching assistants is available on the Office of the Provost website.\nSome graduate programs may require a higher score; It is important to review program websites for additional requirements.\nInternational students who have not taken or passed the one of the required proficiency tests specified above, may take the Oral English Assessment Interview (OEAI). Additional information regarding the OEAI is available on the Department of Linguistics website.\nFor more information about the English proficiency requirement for teaching assistants, please contact your program of study office or refer to the Department of Linguistics website.\nAll applicants who are not a U.S. Citizen or Lawful Permanent Resident will be required to indicate a visa eligibility document that you need.\nF-1 Students: Admitted applicants who request and are eligible for an F-1 visa will be issued a Certificate of Eligibility (Form I-20). To be eligible for this form, students must provide evidence of financial resources and a copy of their passport.\nStudents with F-1 visas may hold graduate assistantships and other forms on-campus employment; however, these appointments may not exceed 20 hours of work per week. F-1 students may not work off-campus. Twelve months of optional practical training (OPT) in a study program may be authorized. Students enrolled in designated STEM fields may qualify for additional OPT. Dependents of F-1 students cannot be employed.\nJ-1 Students: For applicants requesting and qualifying for a J-1 visa, a DS-2019 Form will be issued. Eligibility for the DS-2019 requires evidence of financial resources and a copy of the student’s passport. This form is available for applicants sponsored by governments, international foundations, or agencies, who are receiving at least 50% of their funding from sources other than personal or family funds, or who are part of a university exchange program.\nEntry into the U.S. is only for the total period of the study program as specified on the DS-2019. J-1 students may work on or off-campus only with written approval from their sponsor. Students may participate in up to 18 months of academic training and up to 36 months of post-doctoral training. Changing visa category is very difficult and may not be allowed. J-1 visa holders may be subject to a 2-year home country residence requirement. Dependents on J-2 visas may seek employment.\nFor both F-1 and J-1 applicants, you will need to specify which type of visa eligibility document you require:\nYou will also be asked if you need any dependent I-20s/DS-2019s:\nAll students issued an I-20 or DS-2019 must pay the SEVIS I-901 fee prior to scheduling their visa interview. Additional information regarding the SEVIS I-901 fee may be obtained from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security website.\nIf you are applying to an online program and will not enter the US, you can indicate this and we need no further visa status information. However, if you will be in the US for your program, you will need to show proof of non-student visa status. Please see the information for current non-student visa holders below.\nIf you are currently in the US on a non-student visa (such as an H-1 work visa) and are planning to remain on this visa for the duration of your studies at Illinois, you will need to indicate your current visa type. In addition, you will need to upload a copy of your current visa. Note that a student may choose to enroll and pursue studies while on an H-1 visa; however, H-1 visa holders cannot hold a graduate assistantship appointment.\nIf another organization, such as IIE Fulbright or LASPAU, will be issuing your DS-2019, you will need to provide us with the name of this organization and upload a copy of your award letter.\nIf you have applied for U.S. Permanent Resident or Asylee status, but have not yet been approved for this student, you will need to provide us with a copy of your Application Receipt Notice from USCIS.\nAsylee, Paroled in Public Interest, and Refugee applicants will be asked to indicate a visa eligibility document that you need; please select None and find your appropriate status option. If you have been granted one of these statuses, you will need to upload documentation of this status. You will then be classified as a domestic student.\nAll international applicants requesting visa eligibility documents (I-20 or DS-2019) are required to demonstrate that they have adequate financial resources to cover the cost of their education while in the United States. International applicants should upload proof of funding documentation directly to the online application. Note that this documentation may be submitted after you submit your graduate application.\nPersonal Funds: If the student will provide funding from personal funds, a bank statement with sufficient funding for at least one year’s total cost* is required.\nFamily/Individual Sponsor Funds: If a family member or other personal sponsor will provide funding, a bank statement with sufficient funding for at least one year’s total cost* is required. Sponsors must also complete the Declaration and Certification of Finances form verifying sponsorship for full length and cost of the program or provide a signed letter of sponsorship detailing the specific amounts and length of sponsorship.\nOrganization Funds: If an employer, government or other organization will provide funding, a signed letter of sponsorship detailing amounts and length of sponsorship is required.\nBank Statements: All bank statements must include the bank's letterhead or logo, as well as a bank stamp or signature. The statement must list the account holder’s name and show sufficient funding for one year’s costs* (or the amount of sponsorship for one year), must be dated within one year of submission, and must show funding in liquid accounts, such as savings, checking, money market accounts, or CDs. Non-liquid funding such as stocks, bonds, auto/land deeds are not acceptable forms of financial support. Solvency and opinion statements are not acceptable forms of financial support.\nDeclaration and Certification of Finance Forms: Family or other individual sponsors must sign and print their name and relationship to the student, and the form must be dated within one year of submission. Signing this document verifies sponsorship for the full length and cost of the program. Organizations should NOT use this form and should instead provide a letter of sponsorship (see below). The form is available in PDF format here.\nIndividual Letters of Sponsorship: Family or other individual sponsors may provide a letter of sponsorship to detail the amounts and length of their sponsorship. These letters should include a printed name and signature from the sponsor and be dated within one year of submission.\nOrganization Letters of Sponsorship: Employer, government or other organization sponsors must provide an official letter of sponsorship on organizational letterhead and include a signature or stamp showing the authenticity of the letter. The letter must detail amounts and length of sponsorship and be dated within one year of submission.\n*Please view the Declaration and Certificate of Finance Form for annual cost information. Please also note that J-1 students will be required to show proof of funding (via bank statement) for the entire cost of the program (or the portion for which funds are being covered by personal or other individual sponsor funding).\nYou are required to upload a copy of your proof of funding documentation to the online application. English translations should be included if the documentation is not in English.\nPlease obtain an electronic version of your proof of financial documentation (bank statements, declaration forms, letters of sponsorship) or scan a copy of the document you may already have at the lowest resolution that results in a legible document (we recommend using under 200 dpi whenever possible). You may upload an institutional web-based bank statement if the financial institution has put your name on the statement.\nPlease be certain that your document is saved as a PDF file or Word document. Scanning in “gray scale” or black and white may produce the best results. If the scanned file is too large you may want to make a photocopy first (experiment with different settings until you find one that results in the smallest file size) then scan the photocopy.\nNon-legible scans will not be accepted.\nThe University of Illinois reserves the right to require official proof of funding documentation at any time during the SEVIS review process.\n507 East Green StreetSuite 101, MC-434Champaign, IL 61820\nPhone: 217.333.0035Email: grad@illinois.edu\nMake A Gift\n• The English as a Second Language Placement Test (EPT) will be required prior to enrolling at Illinois for all students who score below the full status minimums listed in the chart above.
