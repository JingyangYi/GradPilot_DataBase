Problems with eyesight can have a profound impact on an individual’s life. Through optometry, many vision problems and eye diseases can be corrected or managed, restoring sight to people from all walks of life.\nOptometrists diagnose vision problems, eye diseases and other eye health issues. These highly skilled professionals correct poor vision and manage or slow degenerative eye diseases with corrective lenses, optical aids, therapy or medication.\nKey skills: accuracy, dexterity, communication\nIndicative mean salary: $85,153^\nIndustry growth: strong\nThe demand for qualified optometrists remains steady in Australia and globally, due to ageing and growing populations.\nAcross the world, over 2.2 billion people experience vision impairment or blindness.4 Access to proper eye care can correct many of these cases through different clinical measures. Unfortunately, for people living in communities with limited access to healthcare, treatment for vision problems is often inadequate. There are many opportunities for qualified optometrists to join programs and organisations that provide care to these populations on a short-term or long-term basis.\nUNSW's School of Optometry and Vision Science is the only optometry school in New South Wales and one of the largest in Australasia. When you study with us, you’ll benefit from our strong partnerships within the ophthalmic industry and healthcare sector. Please note that while vision science is offered as a major in some undergraduate science degrees, the School of Optometry and Vision Science sits within the Faculty of Medicine & Health.\nYou’ll study the science and theory that practising optometrists require while gaining hands-on experience in our optometry clinic. The UNSW Optometry Clinic is open to the public and provides a wide range of clinical services using state-of-the-art diagnostic equipment.\nWe provide students with a varied education in vision science and optometry through the Centre for Eye Health, Brien Holden Vision Institute and Optometry Giving Sight.\nYou can work in a range of roles related to eye care dispensing optical devices, including contact lenses, spectacles and ocular implants. Graduates also find jobs in ocular imaging, drug development and research.\nYou can study optometry at the undergraduate level through UNSW's standalone Bachelor of Vision Science or the combined undergraduate/postgraduate Bachelor of Vision Science/Master of Clinical Optometry degree.\nYou can also study vision science as a major in the following undergraduate science degrees:\nThe Master of Clinical Optometry will provide you with the relevant qualifications to become an optometrist in Australia, New Zealand and many countries overseas.\n^Job Outlook, Australian Government National

People with a scientific mindset are natural problem solvers much like entrepreneurs. Many innovations such as virtual reality headsets, 3D printing and self-driving cars arose from Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) areas.\nEntrepreneurship applies innovative concepts to human problems, providing unique and valuable solutions to users. An entrepreneur’s implementation of innovation often disrupts the market and shapes consumer behaviour. Since its inception, Uber has changed the taxi industry beyond measure. People needing transport can now organise pick-up through their smartphone, tracking their rides’ progress in real-time.\nAn entrepreneur's expertise lies in recognising market demand and customer needs before other businesses. They achieve this via a problem-solving mindset and big picture thinking. STEM areas like aviation, data science, microbiology, astronomy and biotechnologies are ripe for entrepreneurial disruption given they rely on the constant evolution of technology. Disruption can occur by finding better ways to utilise data, listening to customer needs and developing new technologies and more.\nKey skills: leadership, communication, agile thinking\nIndustry growth: strong\nCareers in entrepreneurship\nA career in entrepreneurship combines a mix of experience, skills and interests. What you study at university will influence the areas of entrepreneurship you choose as a career path. Professionals in this field work across all sectors but specialise in their area of expertise.\nThis career path often means a lot more freedom and self-determination than other careers. Many entrepreneurs are their own boss and the concept or idea they bring to fruition is their own company.\nEntrepreneurs can also pursue careers in traditional organisations. Many projects within large organisations often rely on an entrepreneur who understands the importance of business and research planning for innovation.\nTo be a successful entrepreneur in areas relating to STEM, a relevant education is generally required. UNSW Science degrees are designed to prepare you for the competitive job market of today and tomorrow.\nRelevant roles\n\nbusiness development manager\nfreelancer\ninnovator\nconsultant\nproduct manager\nbusiness owner\nchief executive officer\nsoftware developer\ninfluencer\nblogger\ndigital nomad\neCommerce specialist\naccount executive\n\nCareer paths at UNSW\nIf you’re interested in a future as an entrepreneur, UNSW Science can provide a great foundation.

People employed as consultants provide advice to businesses, government, not-for-profit organisations and other sectors of the economy. They give high-level direction on the ways an organisation is managed and run, on projects and products, and on strategic-level decision-making.\nConsulting in Australia is dominated by the ‘big four’ firms - Deloitte, EY, KPMG and PwC – which provide most of the consultancy services to Australian organisations. A group of smaller companies – BCG, McKinsey & Company, Bain & Company, Accenture, Grant Thornton - take up a large slice of the remainder.\nKey skills: critical thinking, intepersonal, decision-making\nIndicative mean salary: $77,000^\nIndustry growth: strong\nCareers in consulting\nConsultants are often hired by firms facing specific problems that require a solution over a short period of time. For example, a company may need scientific advice about a new product that can be manufactured or marketed, how to develop and implement environmental policies or how to implement a change in legal regulations that affect the company.\nAs well as having scientific expertise, consultants need to have a flexible approach to work, must be able to work in a team, make connections in new work environments quickly, be adaptable and manage their own work and time.\nCareer paths at UNSW\nScience degrees at UNSW offer you flexibility, with a wide range of learning that's ideal if you’re planning a career in consulting. The skills you’ll learn will be transferable into the workplace.\nUndergraduate degrees\nUNSW Science undergraduate degrees feature a wide variety of majors, from fundamental sciences, like chemistry, physics, biology and mathematics to wider applications and methodologies, like data science, life sciences and environmental sciences.

People employed as consultants provide advice to businesses, government, not-for-profit organisations and other sectors of the economy. They give high-level direction on the ways an organisation is managed and run, on projects and products, and on strategic-level decision-making.\nConsulting in Australia is dominated by the ‘big four’ firms - Deloitte, EY, KPMG and PwC – which provide most of the consultancy services to Australian organisations. A group of smaller companies – BCG, McKinsey & Company, Bain & Company, Accenture, Grant Thornton - take up a large slice of the remainder.\nKey skills: critical thinking, intepersonal, decision-making\nIndicative mean salary: $77,000^\nIndustry growth: strong\nCareers in consulting\nConsultants are often hired by firms facing specific problems that require a solution over a short period of time. For example, a company may need scientific advice about a new product that can be manufactured or marketed, how to develop and implement environmental policies or how to implement a change in legal regulations that affect the company.\nAs well as having scientific expertise, consultants need to have a flexible approach to work, must be able to work in a team, make connections in new work environments quickly, be adaptable and manage their own work and time.\nCareer paths at UNSW\nScience degrees at UNSW offer you flexibility, with a wide range of learning that's ideal if you’re planning a career in consulting. The skills you’ll learn will be transferable into the workplace.\nUndergraduate degrees\nUNSW Science undergraduate degrees feature a wide variety of majors, from fundamental sciences, like chemistry, physics, biology and mathematics to wider applications and methodologies, like data science, life sciences and environmental sciences.

People with a scientific mindset are natural problem solvers much like entrepreneurs. Many innovations such as virtual reality headsets, 3D printing and self-driving cars arose from Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) areas.\nEntrepreneurship applies innovative concepts to human problems, providing unique and valuable solutions to users. An entrepreneur’s implementation of innovation often disrupts the market and shapes consumer behaviour. Since its inception, Uber has changed the taxi industry beyond measure. People needing transport can now organise pick-up through their smartphone, tracking their rides’ progress in real-time.\nAn entrepreneur's expertise lies in recognising market demand and customer needs before other businesses. They achieve this via a problem-solving mindset and big picture thinking. STEM areas like aviation, data science, microbiology, astronomy and biotechnologies are ripe for entrepreneurial disruption given they rely on the constant evolution of technology. Disruption can occur by finding better ways to utilise data, listening to customer needs and developing new technologies and more.\nKey skills: leadership, communication, agile thinking\nIndustry growth: strong\nCareers in entrepreneurship\nA career in entrepreneurship combines a mix of experience, skills and interests. What you study at university will influence the areas of entrepreneurship you choose as a career path. Professionals in this field work across all sectors but specialise in their area of expertise.\nThis career path often means a lot more freedom and self-determination than other careers. Many entrepreneurs are their own boss and the concept or idea they bring to fruition is their own company.\nEntrepreneurs can also pursue careers in traditional organisations. Many projects within large organisations often rely on an entrepreneur who understands the importance of business and research planning for innovation.\nTo be a successful entrepreneur in areas relating to STEM, a relevant education is generally required. UNSW Science degrees are designed to prepare you for the competitive job market of today and tomorrow.\nRelevant roles\n\nbusiness development manager\nfreelancer\ninnovator\nconsultant\nproduct manager\nbusiness owner\nchief executive officer\nsoftware developer\ninfluencer\nblogger\ndigital nomad\neCommerce specialist\naccount executive\n\nCareer paths at UNSW\nIf you’re interested in a future as an entrepreneur, UNSW Science can provide a great foundation.

People employed as consultants provide advice to businesses, government, not-for-profit organisations and other sectors of the economy. They give high-level direction on the ways an organisation is managed and run, on projects and products, and on strategic-level decision-making.\nConsulting in Australia is dominated by the ‘big four’ firms - Deloitte, EY, KPMG and PwC – which provide most of the consultancy services to Australian organisations. A group of smaller companies – BCG, McKinsey & Company, Bain & Company, Accenture, Grant Thornton - take up a large slice of the remainder.\nKey skills: critical thinking, intepersonal, decision-making\nIndicative mean salary: $77,000^\nIndustry growth: strong\nCareers in consulting\nConsultants are often hired by firms facing specific problems that require a solution over a short period of time. For example, a company may need scientific advice about a new product that can be manufactured or marketed, how to develop and implement environmental policies or how to implement a change in legal regulations that affect the company.\nAs well as having scientific expertise, consultants need to have a flexible approach to work, must be able to work in a team, make connections in new work environments quickly, be adaptable and manage their own work and time.\nCareer paths at UNSW\nScience degrees at UNSW offer you flexibility, with a wide range of learning that's ideal if you’re planning a career in consulting. The skills you’ll learn will be transferable into the workplace.\nUndergraduate degrees\nUNSW Science undergraduate degrees feature a wide variety of majors, from fundamental sciences, like chemistry, physics, biology and mathematics to wider applications and methodologies, like data science, life sciences and environmental sciences.

People employed as consultants provide advice to businesses, government, not-for-profit organisations and other sectors of the economy. They give high-level direction on the ways an organisation is managed and run, on projects and products, and on strategic-level decision-making.\nConsulting in Australia is dominated by the ‘big four’ firms - Deloitte, EY, KPMG and PwC – which provide most of the consultancy services to Australian organisations. A group of smaller companies – BCG, McKinsey & Company, Bain & Company, Accenture, Grant Thornton - take up a large slice of the remainder.\nKey skills: critical thinking, intepersonal, decision-making\nIndicative mean salary: $77,000^\nIndustry growth: strong\nCareers in consulting\nConsultants are often hired by firms facing specific problems that require a solution over a short period of time. For example, a company may need scientific advice about a new product that can be manufactured or marketed, how to develop and implement environmental policies or how to implement a change in legal regulations that affect the company.\nAs well as having scientific expertise, consultants need to have a flexible approach to work, must be able to work in a team, make connections in new work environments quickly, be adaptable and manage their own work and time.\nCareer paths at UNSW\nScience degrees at UNSW offer you flexibility, with a wide range of learning that's ideal if you’re planning a career in consulting. The skills you’ll learn will be transferable into the workplace.\nUndergraduate degrees\nUNSW Science undergraduate degrees feature a wide variety of majors, from fundamental sciences, like chemistry, physics, biology and mathematics to wider applications and methodologies, like data science, life sciences and environmental sciences.

An entrepreneur’s implementation of innovation often disrupts the market and shapes consumer behaviour. Since its inception, Uber has changed the taxi industry beyond measure. People needing transport can now organise pick-up through their smartphone, tracking their rides’ progress in real-time.\nAn entrepreneur's expertise lies in recognising market demand and customer needs before other businesses. They achieve this via a problem-solving mindset and big picture thinking. STEM areas like aviation, data science, microbiology, astronomy and biotechnologies are ripe for entrepreneurial disruption given they rely on the constant evolution of technology. Disruption can occur by finding better ways to utilise data, listening to customer needs and developing new technologies and more.\nKey skills: leadership, communication, agile thinking\nIndustry growth: strong\nCareers in entrepreneurship\nA career in entrepreneurship combines a mix of experience, skills and interests. What you study at university will influence the areas of entrepreneurship you choose as a career path. Professionals in this field work across all sectors but specialise in their area of expertise.\nThis career path often means a lot more freedom and self-determination than other careers. Many entrepreneurs are their own boss and the concept or idea they bring to fruition is their own company.\nEntrepreneurs can also pursue careers in traditional organisations. Many projects within large organisations often rely on an entrepreneur who understands the importance of business and research planning for innovation.\nTo be a successful entrepreneur in areas relating to STEM, a relevant education is generally required.

programs, including:\nThere are three grouped rounds per intake, with the number of offers in each round reflecting program capacity. Applications submitted before the application deadline for a specific grouped offer round will be ranked based on academic merit and offers will be made to the top-ranked applicants.

As a result, we expect that there may be longer visa processing times for students submitting visa applications to study at UNSW Sydney.\nTo avoid delays on your study plan, we encourage you to submit your visa application to the Australian Government as soon as you receive a Confirmation of Enrolment (COE) from us.\nFor more information about applying for an Australian Student Visa, please visit this page.\nUNSW will be making offers to eligible postgraduate programs on the basis of six out of eight or seven out of eight semesters studied. Students will need a weighted average mark (WAM) of 5 points above the advertised level to be eligible with 6/8 semesters studied, or a weighted average mark (WAM) of 2 points above the advertised level to be eligible with 7/8 or 5/6 semesters studied.\nApplicants who do not meet this rank will be placed on hold and may be made an offer once they upload their final results.\nWe have altered our policy around predicted grades to widen the qualifications that we accept and have improved the process of assessment. UNSW now accepts predicted grades for full offers for the following qualifications:\nStudents who are completing an approved external English language program can request an extension of their offer deadline until their course is finished.\nForecast results must be presented in the following format:\nStudents who meet program entry requirements based on their SAT, AP, or ACT results are now eligible to receive a full or conditional on English offer ahead of their final high school result and proof of and completion of high school studies. Results and proof of high school completion will be required no later than the UNSW term commencement date and must be submitted as soon as they become available. This change aims to support students in lodging timely visa applications and re-establishes opportunity to commence their undergraduate studies as planned.\nIn addition to sharing SAT/AP/ACT results with UNSW via the College Board portal, students must submit a letter from their school meeting the following minimum criteria:\nThis assessment policy is only available for students completing Year 12 high school qualifications recognised by UNSW for direct entry. It excludes:\nIf an application is incomplete by the final submission date for that term, it will not meet the requirements and will not be eligible for an offer, resulting in a denial.\nTo be eligible for consideration in a grouped offer round, applicants must meet the minimum entry requirements for the program as listed on the degree page for the program noting that these requirements are a guide only and do not guarantee an offer will be made.\nUpon assessment within each offer round, applicants will fall into one of three categories:\nUNSW is unable to provide estimated grouped offer round admissions cut-offs as these will be based on the quality of applicants within each offer round. Once the initial three rounds of grouped offers are complete for a program, we will publish indicative scores (including average and lowest scores for receiving an offer) on the relevant program’s degree page on the UNSW website.\nThe number of offers made during each round will be determined by program capacity. UNSW is unable to share this information with applicants.\nUNSW reserves the right to make ad-hoc offers to exceptional applicants outside of the grouped offer rounds. We will also continue to make offers via UAC for relevant students, with entry ranks reflecting grouped offer round cut-offs.\nIf you need to complete a 10-week or 15-week University English Entry Course (UEEC) offered by UNSW College and are looking to study one of the high-demand programs in 2026, please submit your complete application by the grouped round 1 application deadline of each term for your best opportunity to commence your study in that term.\nIf you require an English package and would like to defer, you will need to request a deferred offer from UNSW. Once you have the deferred offer, it should be provided to UNSW College Admissions, who can issue an updated offer for your English course. Please note, deferral requests are not guaranteed to be approved.\nUNSW expects to make a number of offers through UAC for International Students. The majority of these offers will be made in the UAC December Round 2 offer round for 2026 intake.\nUNSW will release conditional offers based on English language results during regular offer rounds. These offers will include an expiry deadline by which students must meet the conditions - either by submitting their English test results or enrolling in UNSW College’s UEEC program.\nStudents who are completing an approved external English language program can request an extension of their offer expiry deadline until their course is finished.\nStudents seeking to defer their offer to study at UNSW (before accepting) may submit an offer deferral request via the following channels:\nPlease note that offer deferral is not guaranteed and requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Where permitted, offers will only be able to be deferred for a period of up to one year.\nYou can find more about deferment and deferral here.\nMost UNSW international offer holders will have a personalised offer expiry date to accept, decline or defer their study at UNSW. The offer expiry will be active from the date that you receive your offer and your offer will lapse after the offer expiry date.\nOffer holders will have until 11:59 pm (AEDT) to accept their offer on the acceptance deadline date.\nThe following cohorts will not have an offer expiry:\nUAC International Offer Holders will also receive a personalised offer expiry and must accept within this period.\nConditional offer holders will have an offer expiry date that conditions must be met by in order to be issued a full, unconditional offer. Please note these full offers will also have an additional offer expiry date.\nFull offer holders\nFull offer holders will now have 21 days to accept their offer before it expires.\nConditional offer holders\nConditional offer holders will have 8 weeks (56 days) to meet the conditions of their offer, either by submitting English language results or confirming their enrolment in UNSW College’s UEEC program and accept their offer. Students who are completing an approved external English language program can request an extension of their offer expiry deadline until their course is finished.\nOnce the conditions are met and offer is accepted, students will receive a full offer, which will include our standard 21-day period to accept the offer.\nYou can see your offer expiry date on your offer letter and on UNSW Accept Online.\nYou will need to reapply to study at UNSW.\nUNSW will only approve for an extension on an offer under special circumstances. This also applies for UAC International students who have missed the deadline.\nThe below reasons are not accepted as reasons for extension of an offer:\nIf you have an extenuating circumstance, please contact your agent or UNSW regional representative.\nUNSW will only approve for an extension on an offer under extreme special circumstances. This also applies for UAC International students who have missed the deadline.\nYou will not receive another offer letter, however you can see the revised expiry date on UNSW Accept Online.\nMost UNSW offer holders will have a set time period to accept, decline or defer their study at UNSW. The personalised offer expiry is specified in the offer letter and UNSW Accept Online.\nIf you are in one of the following cohorts, you will not have a personalised offer expiry:\nUNSW will move to a new academic calendar in 2028.\nAs a global top 20 university and ranked number one in Australia for employment outcomes (2025 QS World University Rankings), this new academic calendar is designed to meet the changing needs of the broader educational landscape and follows extensive feedback from students, staff and the community over the past 18 months.\nThe new ‘flex-semester’ calendar is a semester structure for our undergraduate students and the majority of postgraduate students, centring on delivering the best learning experiences and outcomes for all our students throughout their lifelong education journey.\nFor further information on the new calendar and FAQs please visit our website.\nIf you can’t find the answer you’re looking for below, our Future Student Advisers are here to help.\nSign up to our newsletter - we'll keep you updated on degree information, scholarships and upcoming events.\n• Search\n• LinkedIn\n• Facebook\n• Instagram\n• TikTok\n• YouTube\n• Applications are prioritised according to academic merit and subject to program availability.\n• Issued offers will have a specified acceptance period.\n• Offer deferrals will no longer be automatically approved.\n• Change of program requests will only be considered with a new application.\n• Grouped offer rounds are used for high-demand programs.

UNSW is unable to share this information with applicants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Will there be additional offers made outside of the scheduled grouped offer rounds for the high-demand programs? \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUNSW reserves the right to make ad-hoc offers to exceptional applicants outside of the grouped offer rounds.

Once you have the deferred offer, it should be provided to UNSW College Admissions, who can issue an updated offer for your English course. Please note, deferral requests are not guaranteed to be approved. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Is UNSW still making offers through UAC International?\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUNSW expects to make a number of offers through UAC for International Students.

As a result, we expect that there may be longer visa processing times for students submitting visa applications to study at UNSW Sydney.  \nTo avoid delays on your study plan, we encourage you to submit your visa application to the Australian Government as soon as you receive a Confirmation of Enrolment (COE) from us.\nFor more information about applying for an Australian Student Visa, please visit this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAQs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Apply to UNSW\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Can I apply to UNSW with incomplete academic results? \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUNSW will be making offers to eligible postgraduate programs on the basis of six out of eight or seven out of eight semesters studied. Students will need a weighted average mark (WAM) of 5 points above the advertised level to be eligible with 6/8 semesters studied, or a weighted average mark (WAM) of 2 points above the advertised level to be eligible with 7/8 or 5/6 semesters studied.\nApplicants who do not meet this rank will be placed on hold and may be made an offer once they upload their final results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Will UNSW accept predicted grades for full undergraduate offers?\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have altered our policy around predicted grades to widen the qualifications that we accept and have improved the process of assessment. UNSW now accepts predicted grades for full offers for the following qualifications:\n\nInternational Baccalaureate (IB)\nA-Levels\nIndian CBSE\nSingapore A-levels\nNCUK\nSouth African NSC\n\nStudents who are completing an approved external English language program can request an extension of their offer deadline until their course is finished.\nKey considerations:\n\nA buffer of 2 points above the standard entry requirement is required for a full offer based on predicted grades. Offers will only be issued where this is met or exceeded and all other requirements have been met.\nStudents must provide final results when available, and no later than the UNSW term commencement date.\nIf final results do not meet program entry requirements, students may need to:\ntransfer to a program with lower requirements, or\nexplore pathway options such as UNSW College Diplomas, or\nseek study alternatives outside UNSW\n\n\n\nRequired documentation:\nForecast results must be presented in the following format:\n\nBe printed on official school letterhead and include the institution stamp and signature of the Principal, Registrar or Academic Director.\nBe dated after 1 May for Term 1 (February intake) and 1 November of the previous year for Term 3 (September intake).\nFor IB Forecast only: IB Forecast results have the total predicted score as well as the individual scores for each subject.\nThe total predicted aggregate must be the equivalent of 2 points higher than the total final aggregate required for admission.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                What are the eligibility criteria and additional requirements for UNSW applicants holding SAT, AP, or ACT results?\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents who meet program entry requirements based on their SAT, AP, or ACT results are now eligible to receive a full or conditional on English offer ahead of their final high school result and proof of and completion of high school studies. Results and proof of high school completion will be required no later than the UNSW term commencement date and must be submitted as soon as they become available. This change aims to support students in lodging timely visa applications and re-establishes opportunity to commence their undergraduate studies as planned.\nAdditional requirement – enrolment or expected graduation letter\nIn addition to sharing SAT/AP/ACT results with UNSW via the College Board portal, students must submit a letter from their school meeting the following minimum criteria:\n\nprinted on official school letterhead\nbears the official seal of the school\nincludes the student’s full name and date of birth\nspecifies the current stage of study (e.g., Year 11/12)\nstates the expected graduation date\nspecifies the name of the final award or test (e.g., US High School Diploma, Chinese High School Graduation Certificate, Indonesian SMA Certificate)\n\nEligibility\nThis assessment policy is only available for students completing Year 12 high school qualifications recognised by UNSW for direct entry.

UNSW is unable to share this information with applicants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Will there be additional offers made outside of the scheduled grouped offer rounds for the high-demand programs? \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUNSW reserves the right to make ad-hoc offers to exceptional applicants outside of the grouped offer rounds. We will also continue to make offers via UAC for relevant students, with entry ranks reflecting grouped offer round cut-offs. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                I need to complete the 10 or 15-week University English Entry Course (UEEC) before studying at UNSW.

Once you have the deferred offer, it should be provided to UNSW College Admissions, who can issue an updated offer for your English course. Please note, deferral requests are not guaranteed to be approved. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Is UNSW still making offers through UAC International?\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUNSW expects to make a number of offers through UAC for International Students. The majority of these offers will be made in the UAC December Round 2 offer round for 2026 intake.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Will UNSW issue conditional offers?\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUNSW will release conditional offers based on English language results during regular offer rounds. These offers will include an expiry deadline by which students must meet the conditions - either by submitting their English test results or enrolling in UNSW College’s UEEC program.\nStudents who are completing an approved external English language program can request an extension of their offer expiry deadline until their course is finished. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Can I defer my offer?\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents seeking to defer their offer to study at UNSW (before accepting) may submit an offer deferral request via the following channels:\n\nStudents with full offers can now request a deferral via Accept Online.\nStudents with conditional offers can submit a deferral request via the Ask Admissions online form.\n\nPlease note that offer deferral is not guaranteed and requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

The hub was established due to the ongoing fire incidents that have occurred throughout Australia.\nA whooping $1.1 trillion was lost to property damage in the petrochemical and refinery industries between 2016 and 2017 alone. The catastrophic bushfires that plagued the nation between 2019 and 2020 caused an estimated damage of $110 billion, burned 19 million hectares, destroyed 3,094 homes, and killed an estimated 1.2 billion animals.\nThe hub will focus on many concerns to improve fire safety by developing solutions that will, increase fire resilience in infrastructures, develop mitigation techniques to prevent wildfires, isolate fires when they do occur, create safer work environments in high-risk fire settings and increase the safety of fire rescue operations.\n“Frequency of major natural and man-made fires is increasing, which poses new risks to existing and new infrastructure and assets within the urban, resources, energy and renewables sectors” says Professor Guan Yeoh.\nDriven by the need to find a means to the ongoing struggles that Australia faces with fires, Professor Yeoh has had a long involvement within the fire protection industry. Apart from being the director of an ARC training centre, he is a sitting member in the Fire Research Advisory Committee and has even assisted in investigations of domestic fires alongside Fire and Rescue NSW.\n“There is an urgent need to develop an integrated systems approach that tackles key areas of fire prevention, protection, intervention, mitigation, detection, monitoring and fire risk management to increase the fire resilience of infrastructure and assets”.\nUsing advanced digitisation technologies, the hub will research on creating more effective fire-resilience materials, fire suppression systems and fire detection technologies to prevent fires from occurring and damaging infrastructure.\nIt is expected that the project will position Australia as an epicentre of knowledge regarding the prevention and management of fires. Through the establishment of the hub, training of students and researchers would stimulate the growth and transformation of the fire protection industry with renewed knowledge, leading to commercialisation pathways in manufacturing and consequently, greater economic development for Australia.\n• Search\n• LinkedIn\n• Facebook\n• Instagram\n• TikTok\n• YouTube\n[GRID_TABLE]\nNew ARC Research Hub will develop solutions to the ongoing fire crisis in Australia\nA recent grant of $4.9 million has been awarded to the ARC Research Hub for Fire Resilience Infrastructure, Assets and Safety Advancements (FRIASA) to improve fire safety in Australia.\nPublished on the  02 August 2022\nA new Australian Research Council (ARC) research hub that will focus on cutting edge public research on future fire risks that can affect critical infrastructure in Australia has been established at the School of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering.\nProfessor Guan Yeoh, Director at the Australian Research Council (ARC) Training Centre in Fire Retardant Materials and Safety Technologies and Professor at the School will lead the hub with key academic partners from 5 Australian universities, 14 industry partners and 15 peak bodies to help increase the impact of the hub.\nA total of $4.9 million grant has been awarded to the ARC Research Hub for Fire Resilience Infrastructure, Assets and Safety Advancements (FRIASA) in Urban, Resources, Energy and Renewables Sectors.
