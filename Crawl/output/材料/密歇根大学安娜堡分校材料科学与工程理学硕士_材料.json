We will review your application once everything is complete.\nQ: Will you automatically consider me for the master's degree program if I am not admitted to the Ph.D. program?\nA: No.  A separate application is necessary for admission consideration to the master's program.\nQ: Is a master's degree required to apply for the Ph.D. program?\nA: No, you may directly apply for the Ph.D. program.\nQ: Is there funding available for master's applicants?\nA: No.  Unfortunately, offers of funding are not included in offers for master's admissions.  Applicants should see out external funding options on their own.\nQ: I made a mistake in my submitted materials and I want to update them.  How do I do this?\nA: Updates to your application cannot be made after submission and additional documents cannot be added to your file after submission.  Please ensure that your application is correct and all documents and information you wish to include is accurate at the time of submission.  \nQ: What is the minimum TOEFL requirement?\nA: On the Internet-Based TOEFL, the minimum score is 84.\nQ: Will my application be rejected if I don’t receive the minimum TOEFL score?\nA: No, we consider all aspects of your application and do not automatically reject applicants based on a single criterion.\nQ: How long are my TOEFL and GRE scores good for?\nA: The TOEFL score is good for 2 years, and the GRE score is good for 5 years.\nQ: If I have a test score that will expire during the application process, will you still accept it?\nA: We will accept all scores as long as they are sent to us officially from the testing source, even if they will expire during the application process. We will not accept photocopies as official test scores.\nQ: If my native language is not English, but I am studying at an English-speaking university, do I still need to submit a TOEFL score?\nA: If your native language is not English and you receive a degree from an English-speaking university, then you do not need to submit a TOEFL score.\n More information about TOEFL score requirements can be found here:\nhttp://www.rackham.umich.edu/admissions/tests\nQ: I don't have my GRE or TOEFL scores yet. Can I send them after I receive them and still submit the application now? \nA: Yes, please submit all of your other materials by the deadline, and your scores can be submitted after the deadline and after you submit your application.  In most circumstances, scores are needed in order to make a final admission decision.  \n Q: What are the ETS Institution and Department Codes?\nA: For the GRE: Institution Code 1839 / Department Code 1502.

All Ph.D. Candidates and Research Master’s students who are enrolled in research and not supported by a grant or fellowship are still required to attend the Colloquium series, but need not enroll in MSE 890.  Coursework Master’s students who are not enrolled in research are not required to enroll in MSE 890, but may take up to 2 credits of MSE 890.\nAll course selections must be approved by the faculty research advisor or the graduate advisor.\nThe PhD qualification process in MSE requires the incoming graduate students to take and pass the following core courses, each with at least B+ grade, in their first year:\n* The core course MSE550 is targeted at students entering the MSE graduate program with a non-MSE undergraduate major such as Physics, Chemistry, etc.  The students with non-MSE undergraduate degrees may petition the graduate committee to opt out of 550. The petition should provide evidence, through copy of undergraduate transcript, that the student has taken the equivalent of the following required courses in MSE undergraduate curriculum at University of Michigan, and passed each with B+ or higher grade:\nMSE 220 or 250 (Intro MS&E); MSE 242 (Solid State / Materials Physics);\nMSE 350 (Structures of Materials); MSE 420 (Mechanical Behavior of Materials).\nThe written qualifying exam option as a substitute for taking the core courses will no longer be offered, i.e., all incoming students will be required to take and pass the 2 or 3 (as applicable) core courses. However, a student who takes a core course but fails to get a grade of B+ or higher, may petition the graduate committee to take a ‘make up’ written test in that core course as a second attempt towards qualification. Although the student’s grade on the transcript will not change, the score in the ‘make up’ written test will be used by the graduate committee to determine if the student has met the qualification requirement in that core topic.\nA score below B+ in the core course and failure in the following ‘make up’ written test will result in disqualification from the PhD program.\nStudents who do not complete all of the above PhD qualification core courses in year 1 may be asked to discontinue from the PhD program.\n*Incoming students holding an M.S.E. degree (or equivalent) from another institution must complete 18 credit hours of formal coursework (12 MSE credit hours and 2 cognate courses from a technical area) to fulfill the residency and cognate requirements set forth by the Rackham Graduate School.\nStudents must enroll in MSE 890 (1 credit) for four semesters and attend 70% of the seminars each semester.\nStudents seeking Ph.D. candidacy must successfully pass the Prelim Exam within two years of their initial enrollment in the MSE department. The Prelim Exam will consist of an oral defense of the thesis proposal based on student’s research performed as a pre-candidate or, if approved by the faculty research advisor, prior work towards the Master's degree.\nA thesis proposal document should be submitted to your committee members 10 working days in advance of the prelim examination; and should provide the motivation for the proposed research based on a critical review of the background and relevant literature, a statement of the objective, a description of the proposed research approach, including new proof-of-concept research results, a thorough analysis of the results, a plan for future research, and a list of references.  The document should be less than 20 pages (single-spaced, 12-point font, 1” margins), including figures, but not including references.  Successful completion of the prelim exam is a requirement for advancing to candidacy.\nThe examination is conducted by a committee (selected according to Rackham dissertation committee selection requirements), which is expected to become the doctoral thesis committee if the student becomes a Ph.D. candidate. The committee will report to the Graduate Committee whether the student has passed; and, if not, whether a rescheduled exam is recommended.\nEach student is required to complete one teaching assignment prior to the completion of the Ph.D. degree.  Normally this requirement is met after achieving candidacy.\nAt least one data meeting is required, no later than 4 years after initial enrollment.  Final defense is expected within 1 year after the data meeting.\nEach Ph.D. student is required to complete an annual student evaluation form with their advisor by May 31st every year.  Failure to do so may result in cancellation of GSRA/fellowship support.\nA thesis and its public defense are required for the Ph.D. degree as set forth by the Rackham Graduate School.\n• About UsOverview & MissionWelcome from the ChairWhat is MSE?Maps & DirectionsContact\n• Overview & Mission\n• Welcome from the Chair\n• What is MSE?\n• Maps & Directions\n• Contact\n• Undergraduate StudyOverviewProgramsOverviewMajorMinorSUGSConsidering the MSE Major?Advising & ResourcesUndergraduate CoursesFacilitiesOverviewVan Vlack LabResearch/InternshipsStudent Organizations/TeamsCareersAccreditation\n• Overview\n• ProgramsOverviewMajorMinorSUGSConsidering the MSE Major?\n• Overview\n• Major\n• Minor\n• SUGS\n• Considering the MSE Major?\n• Advising & Resources\n• Undergraduate Courses\n• FacilitiesOverviewVan Vlack Lab\n• Overview\n• Van Vlack Lab\n• Research/Internships\n• Student Organizations/Teams\n• Careers\n• Accreditation\n• Graduate StudyOverviewAdmissionsMS Degree RequirementsPhD Degree RequirementsGraduate CoursesGraduate Advising & FormsGSI InformationGrad Student CouncilSURE/SROP\n• Overview\n• Admissions\n• MS Degree Requirements\n• PhD Degree Requirements\n• Graduate Courses\n• Graduate Advising & Forms\n• GSI Information\n• Grad Student Council\n• SURE/SROP\n• ResearchOverviewHanawalt XMALEquipment BookingCenters\n• Overview\n• Hanawalt XMAL\n• Equipment Booking\n• Centers\n• PeopleDirectoryFacultyCourtesy FacultyLecturersAdjunct FacultyEmeritus FacultyStaffResearch ScientistsGraduate StudentsResearch Fellows\n• Directory\n• Faculty\n• Courtesy Faculty\n• Lecturers\n• Adjunct Faculty\n• Emeritus Faculty\n• Staff\n• Research Scientists\n• Graduate Students\n• Research Fellows\n• News & EventsOverviewNewsEventsVideosOutreachFaculty AwardsNewslettersVan Vlack LectureshipPehlke Lectureship\n• Overview\n• News\n• Events\n• Videos\n• Outreach\n• Faculty Awards\n• Newsletters\n• Van Vlack Lectureship\n• Pehlke Lectureship\n• AlumniNewsGivingNewslettersAlumni Merit AwardsDistinguished Alumni LectureExternal Advisory BoardAlumni Profiles\n• News\n• Giving\n• Newsletters\n• Alumni Merit Awards\n• Distinguished Alumni Lecture\n• External Advisory Board\n• Alumni Profiles\n• Overview & Mission\n• Welcome from the Chair\n• What is MSE?\n• Maps & Directions\n• Contact\n• Overview\n• ProgramsOverviewMajorMinorSUGSConsidering the MSE Major?\n• Overview\n• Major\n• Minor\n• SUGS\n• Considering the MSE Major?\n• Advising & Resources\n• Undergraduate Courses\n• FacilitiesOverviewVan Vlack Lab\n• Overview\n• Van Vlack Lab\n• Research/Internships\n• Student Organizations/Teams\n• Careers\n• Accreditation\n• Overview\n• Major\n• Minor\n• SUGS\n• Considering the MSE Major?\n• Overview\n• Van Vlack Lab\n• Overview\n• Admissions\n• MS Degree Requirements\n• PhD Degree Requirements\n• Graduate Courses\n• Graduate Advising & Forms\n• GSI Information\n• Grad Student Council\n• SURE/SROP\n• Overview\n• Hanawalt XMAL\n• Equipment Booking\n• Centers\n• Directory\n• Faculty\n• Courtesy Faculty\n• Lecturers\n• Adjunct Faculty\n• Emeritus Faculty\n• Staff\n• Research Scientists\n• Graduate Students\n• Research Fellows\n• Overview\n• News\n• Events\n• Videos\n• Outreach\n• Faculty Awards\n• Newsletters\n• Van Vlack Lectureship\n• Pehlke Lectureship\n• News\n• Giving\n• Newsletters\n• Alumni Merit Awards\n• Distinguished Alumni Lecture\n• External Advisory Board\n• Alumni Profiles\n• Right item 1\n• Right item 2\n• Right item 3\n• CONNECT WITH US:\n• Overview\n• Van Vlack Lab\n• Admissions\n• M.S.

Although the student’s grade on the transcript will not change, the score in the ‘make up’ written test will be used by the graduate committee to determine if the student has met the qualification requirement in that core topic. \nA score below B+ in the core course and failure in the following ‘make up’ written test will result in disqualification from the PhD program.\nStudents who do not complete all of the above PhD qualification core courses in year 1 may be asked to discontinue from the PhD program.\n \n2) COURSEWORK (Graded)\n12 credit hours from MSE courses (generally, 4 courses, including core courses)\nStudents must take at least 2 cognate courses, at least 2 credits each in a technical area and obtain a B- or better in each course.\n9 additional credit hours from MSE or other courses (generally, 3 courses) at least 6 credit hours must be from a technical area.  Students may count no more than 1 non-engineering, professionally related (e.g. business, entrepreneurship, public policy, patent law, TechCom, engineering education) course toward their coursework degree requirement, which must be approved by the student’s advisor (Ph.D.) or Master’s Chair (M.S.) This course cannot be used as a cognate.\n*Incoming students holding an M.S.E. degree (or equivalent) from another institution must complete 18 credit hours of formal coursework (12 MSE credit hours and 2 cognate courses from a technical area) to fulfill the residency and cognate requirements set forth by the Rackham Graduate School.\n \n3) MSE COLLOQUIUM\nStudents must enroll in MSE 890 (1 credit) for four semesters and attend 70% of the seminars each semester. \n \n4) PRELIM (THESIS PROPOSAL) EXAM \nStudents seeking Ph.D. candidacy must successfully pass the Prelim Exam within two years of their initial enrollment in the MSE department. The Prelim Exam will consist of an oral defense of the thesis proposal based on student’s research performed as a pre-candidate or, if approved by the faculty research advisor, prior work towards the Master's degree.\nA thesis proposal document should be submitted to your committee members 10 working days in advance of the prelim examination; and should provide the motivation for the proposed research based on a critical review of the background and relevant literature, a statement of the objective, a description of the proposed research approach, including new proof-of-concept research results, a thorough analysis of the results, a plan for future research, and a list of references.  The document should be less than 20 pages (single-spaced, 12-point font, 1” margins), including figures, but not including references.  Successful completion of the prelim exam is a requirement for advancing to candidacy.\n The examination is conducted by a committee (selected according to Rackham dissertation committee selection requirements), which is expected to become the doctoral thesis committee if the student becomes a Ph.D. candidate. The committee will report to the Graduate Committee whether the student has passed; and, if not, whether a rescheduled exam is recommended.\n \n5) TEACHING REQUIREMENT\nEach student is required to complete one teaching assignment prior to the completion of the Ph.D. degree.  Normally this requirement is met after achieving candidacy.\n \n6) DATA MEETING\nAt least one data meeting is required, no later than 4 years after initial enrollment.  Final defense is expected within 1 year after the data meeting.\n \n7) ANNUAL PHD STUDENT EVALUATION FORM \nEach Ph.D. student is required to complete an annual student evaluation form with their advisor by May 31st every year.  Failure to do so may result in cancellation of GSRA/fellowship support.\n \n8) THESIS AND THESIS DEFENSE\nA thesis and its public defense are required for the Ph.D. degree as set forth by the Rackham Graduate School.\nPh.D. Degree Requirements\nGraduate\n\n\n\n\n\nAdmissions\n\n\n\n\nM.S.
