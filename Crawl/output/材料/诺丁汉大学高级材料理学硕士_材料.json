You will also gain the experience future employers are looking for and make connections to advance your career.\nUnder the UK's Graduate visa route, you'll be able to stay in the UK to work – or look for work – for up to two years after completing your studies, or up to three years after a PhD course.\nThe Graduate visa is a way for international students, after they have been awarded their degree, to stay in the UK to work or look for work, at any skill level for two years, or three years for doctoral students. It is sometimes referred to as the 'post-study work visa'.\nThe Graduate visa is an unsponsored route, meaning you do not need a job offer to apply for the route. You will be able to work flexibly, switch jobs and develop your career in the UK as required.\nThe Graduate visa will be available for students who:\nIf you intend to apply for the Graduate visa and believe you are eligible, but have not received the confirmation from the Visa and Immigration team within one month after receiving the confirmation of your degree, or if you have less than one month left on your student visa, contact the Visa and Immigration team as soon as possible.\nGovernment's guide to the Graduate visa\nYou won't need to find a job before applying for this visa, and there are no restrictions on the employer, salary level or position you take. We encourage you to seek graduate-level jobs to make the best use of this opportunity. You can also change jobs and employers during your visa period without restrictions. You could even launch your own business with support from our Ingenuity Lab.\nAt the end of the two- or three-year visa period, you can apply for another UK visa route if you meet its requirements. Alternatively, you can return to pursue your career in your home country, building on the skills and experience you've gained while working as a graduate in the UK.\nThe Careers and Employability Service are also here to support you in finding a graduate-level job.\nCareers and employability service\nThe pages below have been created to support you with questions you may have at any stage of the process.\nIf your question has not been answered, please contact the Visa and Immigration Team.\nBefore applying for the graduate visa\nEligibility for the graduate visa\nApplying for the graduate visa\nAfter applying for the graduate visa\nIf you have obtained 'settled' or 'pre-settled' status under the UK's EU Settlement Scheme, then you can live, study and work in the UK freely with this immigration status, and you will not require a Student visa or Graduate visa.\nIrish nationals have the right to live and work in the UK, under the UK-Ireland Common Travel Area arrangements. Irish students will not need to apply for the EU Settlement Scheme, a Student visa or the Graduate immigration route.\nCherry Tree LodgeUniversity Park CampusNottingham, NG7 2RD, UK\n+44 (0)115 84 66125\nimmigration-support@nottingham.ac.uk\nConnect with the University of Nottingham through social media and our blogs.\nCampus maps | More contact information | Jobs\n• UK\n• China\n• Malaysia\n• Study\n• About\n• Research\n• Business\n• News\n• Visit\n• A–Z\n• Study sustainability\n• Study with us\n• Our courses\n• Why study with us?\n• Student experience\n• International students\n\nCountry-specific informationScholarships, funding and financeEnglish languageAccommodationWhy study in the UK?Meet usInternational student lifeHelp with your visaEU students\nWorking in the UK\n\n\nAfter graduation\nFAQs\nSpend part of your degree herePreparing for NottinghamInternational information webinars 2025Contact us\n• Country-specific information\n• Scholarships, funding and finance\n• English language\n• Accommodation\n• Why study in the UK?\n• Meet us\n• International student life\n• Help with your visa\n• EU students\n• Working in the UK\n\n\nAfter graduation\nFAQs\n• After graduation\n• FAQs\n• Spend part of your degree here\n• Preparing for Nottingham\n• International information webinars 2025\n• Contact us\n• Visiting us\n• Online study\n• What next?\n• Frequently asked questions\n• Make an enquiry\n• Country-specific information\n• Scholarships, funding and finance\n• English language\n• Accommodation\n• Why study in the UK?\n• Meet us\n• International student life\n• Help with your visa\n• EU students\n• Working in the UK\n\n\nAfter graduation\nFAQs\n• After graduation\n• FAQs\n• Spend part of your degree here\n• Preparing for Nottingham\n• International information webinars 2025\n• Contact us\n• After graduation\n• FAQs\n• Print\n• Email this Page\n• have studied their course in the UK on a Student visa or Tier 4 visa\n• successfully complete an undergraduate or postgraduate degree course\n• studied at a university with a good track record as an immigration sponsor – such as the University of Nottingham\n• have current and valid Student permission to be in the UK at the time of successfully completing their degree and are physically present in the UK\n• meet the 'study in the UK requirement' – see more in the ‘eligibility for the graduate visa’ section below\n• have not had the Graduate visa before (it is only possible to have this visa once)\n• Check that you will be eligible for the Graduate visa: gov.uk/graduate-visa\n• Successfully complete your studies\n• Receive formal confirmation that your degree has been awarded before your Student permission expires\n• Receive an email from the Visa and Immigration team confirming that the successful completion of your course has been reported to the Home Office\n• Apply for the Graduate visa: gov.uk/graduate-visa/apply\n• The duration of the visa will be two years, or three years for PhD graduates.\n• The fee to apply is £822 per applicant, and the Immigration Health Surcharge is an additional £1,035 per year, per applicant.\n• New dependants are not permitted.

Evidence of relevant personal, professional and educational experience may be taken into consideration. Generally an undergraduate degree will be required, but we may be able to consider experience-based qualifications on a case-by-case basis. Contact the academic school directly for further information.\nInternational and EU students can find guidance on alternative qualifications on our country-specific webpages.\nAll applicants, both home and international, are required to hold English language qualifications at an appropriate level in order to study at the university. If you're a native English speaker, or you have studied in an English-speaking country or institution, we may be able to accept your academic qualifications as evidence of your English language ability.\nIELTS requirements are detailed on our course pages, though we also accept a variety of alternative qualifications.\nIf you require additional support to develop your language skills, you may be able to attend a pre-sessional course at the Centre for English Language Education.\nSome courses require work experience, or other entry requirements, or to demonstrate knowledge of the course. Please check our course pages for details.\nTeaching for most postgraduate taught courses starts late September, while some have alternative start dates. Check course pages for details on start dates and course specific deadlines.\nFor standard late September starts, the application deadline is usually around six to seven weeks before the start date for international applicants. For specific dates for international and home applicants, please check our application deadline information.\nWe will endeavour to make a decision on your application within six weeks of submitting your application and paying your application fee (if required).\nInternational applicants, you should apply as early as possible to ensure that you have enough time to apply for your student visa. If you are successful in receiving an offer, you will need to accept it and meet any outstanding conditions by early September (for our late September start), or as advised by the admissions team.\nAn offer of study is required for many funding opportunities. You should check deadlines for applications carefully, as these are often early in the year. Please apply early and allow time for any fee payments and your application to be processed to avoid disappointment. If you have a known deadline for funding (for example, scholarship, sponsorship etc), we encourage you to make us aware of it in your application.\nYou can apply directly through our online system. You will receive automatic confirmation once you submit your application and can track its progress.\nMake sure that you upload clear scanned copies of your degree certificate (if completed) and final or current transcript, as well as any other supporting documents. We will not be able to assess your application without them. Please do not send us the original copies in the post, as we will be unable to return these.\nDepending on the course you are applying for, you may also need to provide two references, including at least one who can comment on your academic ability. These must be dated within two years of the date of your application and, if not submitted directly by your referee, signed and on letter-headed paper. We may also require a personal statement. If you aren't sure what to include or need more help, please refer to our guidance or contact us.\nApplications for teacher training are made through DfE Apply and MA Social Work are made through UCAS.\nYour application provides an opportunity for you to articulate the skills and experiences you have that make you suitable for a place on our courses. We understand that AI tools can be beneficial in terms of helping you to structure things such as personal statements, or to check for readability. However, please be aware that an over-reliance on AI carries risks, such as falsely generated claims and the potential for the generated work to be of poor quality. Generating all, or a large part of your application submissions and communications regarding your application, using an AI tool and presenting this as your own work or words could affect the outcome of your application.\nThere is an application fee of £50 for postgraduate taught courses.\nApply online\nYou can log in at any time to track the progress of your application.\nTrack your application\nInternational students who are planning to start a full-time postgraduate taught course will be required to pay a tuition fee deposit of at least £3,000 for start dates between August 2025 and July 2026, or £4,500 for start dates from August 2026 onwards, as part of the visa process.\nWe will waive the tuition fee deposit requirement for students who are fully sponsored by a recognised sponsor. If you are fully sponsored for your course fees, you must email us a copy of your sponsorship letter, quoting your full name and application ID.\nThe university will only accept sponsorship letters from recognised sponsors such as overseas governments, international businesses, universities, trusts and charities, and not from friends/family members.\nAdmissions may, at their discretion, ask applicants to provide further information in order to assess their application fairly and accurately. This can include CVs, references (academic and professional) and clarifications regarding their previous and current education. In such cases you will be contacted by admissions via email with a more information request.\nWhen we have made a decision on your application, we will send you an email and let you know what you need to do next.\nDetails on accepting your offer, accommodation and other helpful hints and tips can be found our guidance for applicants.\nStudent Recruitment Support Hub    \n+44 (0) 115 951 5559\nMake an enquiry\nBrowser does not support script.\nConnect with the University of Nottingham through social media and our blogs.\nCampus maps | More contact information | Jobs\n• UK\n• China\n• Malaysia\n• Study\n• About\n• Research\n• Business\n• News\n• Visit\n• A–Z\n• Postgraduate study\n• Why Nottingham?\n• Courses\n• How to apply\n\n\nTaught courses\nResearch coursesHow to write a research proposalApply online\n• Taught courses\n• Research courses\n• How to write a research proposal\n• Apply online\n• Fees\n• Funding\n• Visiting us\n• Already applied?\n• Doctoral Training Programmes\n• Researcher Academy\n• Make an enquiry\n• Taught courses\n• Research courses\n• How to write a research proposal\n• Apply online\n• Print\n• Email this Page\n• If you are interested in a PhD or Research Master's, please see our guidance\n• If you are interested in one of our Pre-sessional English courses, please see our guidance\n• If you are hoping to study with us for part of a degree awarded elsewhere, please contact us\n• Check course requirements\n• Check key dates and deadlines\n• Submit your application\n• Track your application\n• Copyright\n• Terms and conditions\n• Privacy\n• Posting rules\n• Accessibility\n• Freedom of information\n• Charity gateway\n• Cookie policy\n• Cookie Settings\n[CARD]\n1.

Generally an undergraduate degree will be required, but we may be able to consider experience-based qualifications on a case-by-case basis. Contact the academic school directly for further information.\nInternational and EU students can find guidance on alternative qualifications on our country-specific webpages.\nEnglish requirements\nAll applicants, both home and international, are required to hold English language qualifications at an appropriate level in order to study at the university. If you're a native English speaker, or you have studied in an English-speaking country or institution, we may be able to accept your academic qualifications as evidence of your English language ability. \nIELTS requirements are detailed on our course pages, though we also accept a variety of alternative qualifications.\nIf you require additional support to develop your language skills, you may be able to attend a pre-sessional course at the Centre for English Language Education.\nAny other requirements\nSome courses require work experience, or other entry requirements, or to demonstrate knowledge of the course. Please check our course pages for details.\n[CARD]\n2. Check key dates and deadlines\nTeaching for most postgraduate taught courses starts late September, while some have alternative start dates. Check course pages for details on start dates and course specific deadlines.\nFor standard late September starts, the application deadline is usually around six to seven weeks before the start date for international applicants. For specific dates for international and home applicants, please check our application deadline information.\nWe will endeavour to make a decision on your application within six weeks of submitting your application and paying your application fee (if required).\nInternational students\nInternational applicants, you should apply as early as possible to ensure that you have enough time to apply for your student visa. If you are successful in receiving an offer, you will need to accept it and meet any outstanding conditions by early September (for our late September start), or as advised by the admissions team.\nFunding deadlines\nAn offer of study is required for many funding opportunities. You should check deadlines for applications carefully, as these are often early in the year. Please apply early and allow time for any fee payments and your application to be processed to avoid disappointment. If you have a known deadline for funding (for example, scholarship, sponsorship etc), we encourage you to make us aware of it in your application.\n[CARD]\n3. Submit your application\nYou can apply directly through our online system. You will receive automatic confirmation once you submit your application and can track its progress.\nMake sure that you upload clear scanned copies of your degree certificate (if completed) and final or current transcript, as well as any other supporting documents. We will not be able to assess your application without them. Please do not send us the original copies in the post, as we will be unable to return these.\nDepending on the course you are applying for, you may also need to provide two references, including at least one who can comment on your academic ability. These must be dated within two years of the date of your application and, if not submitted directly by your referee, signed and on letter-headed paper. We may also require a personal statement. If you aren't sure what to include or need more help, please refer to our guidance or contact us.\nApplications for teacher training are made through DfE Apply and MA Social Work are made through UCAS.\nUse of Artificial Intelligence (AI)\nYour application provides an opportunity for you to articulate the skills and experiences you have that make you suitable for a place on our courses. We understand that AI tools can be beneficial in terms of helping you to structure things such as personal statements, or to check for readability. However, please be aware that an over-reliance on AI carries risks, such as falsely generated claims and the potential for the generated work to be of poor quality. Generating all, or a large part of your application submissions and communications regarding your application, using an AI tool and presenting this as your own work or words could affect the outcome of your application.\nApplication fee\nThere is an application fee of £50 for postgraduate taught courses.\nApply online\n[CARD]\n4. Track your application\nYou can log in at any time to track the progress of your application.\nTrack your application\nTuition fee deposit\nInternational students who are planning to start a full-time postgraduate taught course will be required to pay a tuition fee deposit of at least £3,000 for start dates between August 2025 and July 2026, or £4,500 for start dates from August 2026 onwards, as part of the visa process.\nWe will waive the tuition fee deposit requirement for students who are fully sponsored by a recognised sponsor. If you are fully sponsored for your course fees, you must email us a copy of your sponsorship letter, quoting your full name and application ID.\nThe university will only accept sponsorship letters from recognised sponsors such as overseas governments, international businesses, universities, trusts and charities, and not from friends/family members.\nFurther information requests\nAdmissions may, at their discretion, ask applicants to provide further information in order to assess their application fairly and accurately. This can include CVs, references (academic and professional) and clarifications regarding their previous and current education. In such cases you will be contacted by admissions via email with a more information request.\nApplication outcome\nWhen we have made a decision on your application, we will send you an email and let you know what you need to do next.\nDetails on accepting your offer, accommodation and other helpful hints and tips can be found our guidance for applicants.",
