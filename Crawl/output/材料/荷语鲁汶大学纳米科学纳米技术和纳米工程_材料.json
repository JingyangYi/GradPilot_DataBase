A multidisciplinary scientific education is offered, integrating nanophysics, nanochemistry, nanomaterials science, nanoelectronics engineering, nanobioscience engineering and quantum engineering, to empower students in creating novel nanodevices and nanomaterials and incorporate them in useful products.\nplaceLeuven\nschool Master's\nschedule 120 ECTS\nlanguage Fully taught in English, also available in Dutch\naccount_balance Faculty of Engineering Science\nNanoscience, Nanotechnology and Nanoengineering, newborn scientific disciplines, are situated at the interface of physics, chemistry, materials science, electronics, biotechnology and quantum engineering. Not only does the nanometer scale allow for a higher density of impactful nanodevices and nanostructures, but it is also the scale, at which the assembly of atoms and molecules into structures determines their electrical, optical, magnetic, thermal and mechanical properties. You will learn the basics of these disciplines at the nanometer scale and the use of nanotechnologies for devices and materials at the macro scale. You decide on a particular scientific focus, as the programme consists of 4 options.\nThe programme is both strongly application-and research-oriented, and is closely linked to the research centres of global leaders such as imec and the Leuven NanoCentre.\nThe nanosciences are multidisciplinary. Special courses are designed to encourage thinking beyond the boundaries of the individual scientific disciplines. The courses are continuously updated following the latest innovations in this young and highly innovative field.\nThe teaching staff in the programme is closely affiliated with cutting-edge research centres like imec and the Leuven NanoCentre, which are considered worldwide leaders in the domain of nanoscience and nanotechnology. The programme therefore has an important research-oriented flavor, and is simultaneously strongly application oriented, with focus on relevant problems in the field, through the strong links of the research centres with industrial partners. In your master’s thesis, you will have the opportunity to work in the exciting research programmes of these institutes.\nAt the Faculty of Engineering Science, students are given the opportunity to complete one or two semesters abroad within the Erasmus+ programme at a European university or a university outside of Europe, or to take a one-week intensive course (Athens week) at another European university.\nThe programme consists of  several course categories, each with their own purpose:\nThe programme culminates in the master's thesis research project.\nYou can also elect to follow a similar interuniversity programme, the Erasmus Mundus master of Science in Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, whereby the first master year is spent at KU Leuven, while the second master year takes place at a partnering university abroad.\nYour programme\nThe Faculty of Engineering Science at KU Leuven is involved in several Erasmus exchange programmes. For the Master of Nanoscience, this means that you can complete one or two semesters abroad, at a number of selected universities.\nGoing abroad\nThe Faculty of Engineering Science offers two types of internships in all its master’s programmes: Industrial Experience and Industrial Internships.\nInternships in nanoscience, nanotechnology and nanoengineering\nRewatch the webinar about the Faculty of Engineering Science programmes given on 28 November 2024.\nAll students who did not obtain their previous degree at an institution of the Flemish Community, must submit an application via the Admissions office.

A multidisciplinary scientific education is offered, integrating nanophysics, nanochemistry, nanomaterials science, nanoelectronics engineering, nanobioscience engineering and quantum engineering, to empower students in creating novel nanodevices and nanomaterials and incorporate them in useful products. \n\n\nAbout the programme\nAdmission and application\nTuition fees\nStudy costs\nAfter graduation\nWhy choose KU Leuven?\nMore information\nContact\nplaceLeuven\nschool Master's\nschedule 120 ECTS\nlanguage Fully taught in English, also available in Dutch\naccount_balance Faculty of Engineering Science\nApply now\n[GRID_TABLE]\nAbout the nano programme \nNanoscience, Nanotechnology and Nanoengineering, newborn scientific disciplines, are situated at the interface of physics, chemistry, materials science, electronics, biotechnology and quantum engineering. Not only does the nanometer scale allow for a higher density of impactful nanodevices and nanostructures, but it is also the scale, at which the assembly of atoms and molecules into structures determines their electrical, optical, magnetic, thermal and mechanical properties. You will learn the basics of these disciplines at the nanometer scale and the use of nanotechnologies for devices and materials at the macro scale. You decide on a particular scientific focus, as the programme consists of 4 options. \nThe programme is both strongly application-and research-oriented, and is closely linked to the research centres of global leaders such as imec and the Leuven NanoCentre. \nProgramme strengths\nThe nanosciences are multidisciplinary. Special courses are designed to encourage thinking beyond the boundaries of the individual scientific disciplines. The courses are continuously updated following the latest innovations in this young and highly innovative field.\nThe teaching staff in the programme is closely affiliated with cutting-edge research centres like imec and the Leuven NanoCentre, which are considered worldwide leaders in the domain of nanoscience and nanotechnology. The programme therefore has an important research-oriented flavor, and is simultaneously strongly application oriented, with focus on relevant problems in the field, through the strong links of the research centres with industrial partners. In your master’s thesis, you will have the opportunity to work in the exciting research programmes of these institutes.\nAt the Faculty of Engineering Science, students are given the opportunity to complete one or two semesters abroad within the Erasmus+ programme at a European university or a university outside of Europe, or to take a one-week intensive course (Athens week) at another European university.\n\n \n\nProgramme Master of Nanoscience, Nanotechnology and Nanoengineering\nThe programme consists of  several course categories, each with their own purpose:\n\n'Fundamental' courses: students typically have a solid fundamental background, but not in all science and engineering disciplines aimed at in this nano master programme. Therefore, the 'fundamental' courses are intended to complete the student's background.\n'Core' courses: the multidisciplinary essence of the nano programme\nOption-specific compulsory courses: the student chooses one of the following four options,  which each have a set of specialization courses:\n\t\nNanomaterials and Nanochemistry\nNanophysics and Nanoelectronics engineering\nNanobiotechnology\nQuantum Engineering, Materials and Technology\n\n\n\n\nTechnical elective courses: the student can choose amongst a long list of nano-specific elective courses, based on personal interest.\nBroadening elective courses: a limited selection is made from a list of general interest courses to enhance non-technical skills\n\nThe programme culminates in the master's thesis research project.\nYou can also elect to follow a similar interuniversity programme, the Erasmus Mundus master of Science in Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, whereby the first master year is spent at KU Leuven, while the second master year takes place at a partnering university abroad.\nYour programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudent exchange\nThe Faculty of Engineering Science at KU Leuven is involved in several Erasmus exchange programmes.

disciplines (mathematics, physics, biology and electronics) in which they have had no training during their bachelor studies and which are essential for the rest of the master.The Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Fundamentals will be determined for each incoming student, based on his/her previous education. Once the fundamental courses are selected and approved they become compulsory for the master. If the students need less than 16 credits, the remaining credits can be chosen from the broadening elective courses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\nECTS\n\n\n\n\nQuantum Physics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                counter_1\n                                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            H06E2A\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\nECTS\n\n\n\n\nSemiconductor Devices\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                counter_1\n                                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            H06F0B\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\nECTS\n\n\n\n\nSemiconductor Physics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                counter_1\n                                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nequal\n\n\n\n\n\n                            H06F2A\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\nECTS\n\n\n\n\nStructure, Synthesis and Cellular Function of Macromolecules\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                counter_1\n                                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            H06F6A\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\nECTS\n\n\n\n\nElectronic Components, Circuits and Sensors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                counter_1\n                                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nequal\n\n\n\n\n\n                            H08T5A\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\nECTS\n\n\n\n\nQuantum Physics II\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                counter_1\n                                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            H0N91A\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncrop_square\n                                        Core Courses\n                \n\n\nAll courses are obligatory.H06N2A \"Lectures on Nanoscience and Nanotechnology\" is spread over two academic years.

Fundamentals will offer the students the necessary basis to disciplines (mathematics, physics, biology and electronics) in which they have had no training during their bachelor studies and which are essential for the rest of the master.The Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Fundamentals will be determined for each incoming student, based on his/her previous education. Once the fundamental courses are selected and approved they become compulsory for the master. If the students need less than 16 credits, the remaining credits can be chosen from the broadening elective courses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\nECTS\n\n\n\n\nQuantum Physics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                counter_1\n                                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            H06E2A\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\nECTS\n\n\n\n\nSemiconductor Devices\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                counter_1\n                                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            H06F0B\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\nECTS\n\n\n\n\nSemiconductor Physics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                counter_1\n                                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nequal\n\n\n\n\n\n                            H06F2A\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\nECTS\n\n\n\n\nStructure, Synthesis and Cellular Function of Macromolecules\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                counter_1\n                                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            H06F6A\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\nECTS\n\n\n\n\nElectronic Components, Circuits and Sensors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                counter_1\n                                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nequal\n\n\n\n\n\n                            H08T5A\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\nECTS\n\n\n\n\nQuantum Physics II\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                counter_1\n                                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            H0N91A\n[CARD]\nQuantum Physics\n3\nECTS\n[CARD]\nNanostructured Bio-Macromolecules\nAll courses are obligatory.H06N2A \"Lectures on Nanoscience and Nanotechnology\" is spread over two academic years.
