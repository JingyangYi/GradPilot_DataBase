First year grad students that are U.S. citizens/permanent residents can apply for a two-year slot on the training grant. International students may apply for a one-year University fellowship if they are not U.S. citizens.\nProgram benefits include the activities below.\nEach trainee selects two mentors, one with a background in chemistry and the other in the life sciences. The primary mentor fulfills the role of a graduate thesis advisor while also ensuring the trainee is fully participating in program activities and completing requirements. The secondary mentor operates in collaboration with the primary mentor, providing insight and strategy from a different disciplinary perspective.\nTrainees spend a total of 10-weeks in the research group of their secondary mentor after their graduate program’s Qualifying Exams and before the end of their third year. This provides trainees with new analytical tools, model systems, and language for applying chemical approaches to research topics in the life sciences. The rotation can be split into (2) five-weeks periods.\nSeminars feature topics that deepen students’ understanding of research at the interface of chemistry and biology. Trainees select and invite external speakers annually from academia, and the pharmaceutical and biotech industries. Students meet with the speakers over lunch and dinner to engage in more in-depth discussions of research approaches and methodologies.\nTrainees present their research to their peers and program preceptors throughout the year at the CLP Research Forum. Presentations not only enable trainees to gain experience in public presentation of their work, they also provide a mechanism for gauging trainee progress and for identifying potential obstacles to the trainee’s project.\nCHEM/IBiS416 (Practical Training in Chemical Biology Methods and Experimental Design) covers topics like high throughput testing, cheminformatics, chemical synthesis and purification, biologics production, in vitro testing, proteomics analysis, and preclinical in vivo testing for efficacy and toxicity, plus in vitro and in vivo imaging techniques for targeting drug delivery, visualizing tumors, and documenting drug uptake and localization. CHEM 314/415 (Principles of Chemical Biology) is also a course requirement for the CLP training program. This chemical biology course will provide you with the concepts, language, and critical literature skills needed to advance your research and professional development.\nTrainees have the opportunity to meet with the program directors, Neil Kelleher, Xiaoyu Zhang, Amy Rosenzweig and Sheila Judge, during the year to discuss project progress and career development.\n• Facebook\n• X\n[GRID_TABLE]\nThe National Institute for General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) has awarded CLP a grant (T32GM149439) for a predoctoral training program at the interface of chemistry:biology which integrates biology and chemistry through a common set of course requirements, a hands-on team based approach to laboratory training, a unique dual preceptor arrangement, and a strong communal training environment.\nApplications are due on July 1st each year.

Potential is largely evaluated through letters of recommendation and the statement of purpose. The GRE is not required for admission, nor will it be reviewed by the committee if submitted.\nSeptember 10th: Portal opens for PhD applicationsDecember 3rd: Application forms must be submitted online by 11:59 P.M. Early January: Last date that supplemental materials (e.g. recommendation letters) will be accepted. January through February: General timeline for most offers of admission to be made.1st and 3rd weekends of March: Group visits of accepted students to Northwestern.Early April: Deadline for students to accept offers of admission.\nYou must apply electronically. There is no paper application. Letters of recommendation and transcripts from ALL schools attended after you complete high school must be submitted online.\nApplication fee waivers can be requested on the application website and are automatically granted to qualified applicants. For more information, see The Graduate School website.\nA financial statement is not necessary for the application process.\nThe MSE department does not require a writing sample separate from the Statement of Purpose. Submission of a concise resume or CV is required.\nAll applications are evaluated the same way, as long as they reach us before the deadline.\nReturn to The Graduate School's Online Application Website. Click on the search button in the User Login section. Still having problems? Contact The Graduate School.\nThe acceptance rate depends on the number of available slots (combination of university fellowships and research assistantships), the number of applications and the likely yield. These numbers tend to fluctuate from year to year. Each applicant is unique, and we cannot assess the chance of success without knowing the full credentials of the applicant.\nAdmissions decisions are made starting in January. We admit students to begin in the Fall quarter of the same year.\nInternational students are supported by a combination of university fellowships and research assistantships. These numbers tend to fluctuate from year to year.\nIn this situation you should indicate your preference for the PhD program. The MS program refers to students who are interested only in that degree. An MS degree is not required for admission to the PhD program in materials science and engineering.\nWe strongly encourage students to finish their degrees from the department in which they originally enrolled. We generally do not accept students from other PhD programs.\nNot before you have been accepted. All decisions on admission and financial support are made by a committee, and individual faculty members do not influence this process. Those applicants who have been admitted are encouraged to email or telephone individual faculty members for information on research, etc.\nPlease note that the committee will review your application whether it’s marked complete or not. We need to review and update the status of the application manually, so please allow us time to process it. This can take some time, especially around the deadline when lots of applications and other materials are coming in.\nYes, we’ll accept them whenever they come in; however, the committee will begin reviewing applications shortly after the deadline so there is no guarantee they will see late submissions.  There’s no way of knowing when a particular applicant’s file will be reviewed, and we will not wait for missing materials to conduct the review.\nReturn to Top\nThe minimum is two, but you may submit three if you wish.\nNo. The Graduate School's policy is to only accept letters of recommendation that are submitted electronically.\nNo particular format, and there is no form that needs to be filled out.\nReturn to Top\nThe GRE is not required for admission. GRE scores of PhD applicants will not be reviewed, even if submitted\nAll international students whose degrees are not from institutions where the language of instruction is English must take the TOEFL or IELTS exam.\nApplicants who will have earned a Bachelor's or Master's degree from a university where the language of instruction is English by the quarter of matriculation will receive a TOEFL waiver.  No special action is needed; we will grant the waiver based on the transcripts submitted with the application.  This includes universities in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, or New Zealand, and many (although not all) universities in India, Singapore, and Nigeria.  Please note that English must be the language of instruction for the entire university, not just the program that you are enrolled in.\nNorthwestern University's school code for the TOEFL is 1565. If you are taking the TOEFL be sure to include this number on your test form.\nAdditionally, you should reference department code 01 when submitting TOEFL scores. IBT test takers should, when prompted, request that their scores be sent to the graduate office (versus undergraduate) and then select the program name that most closely matches their program of interest. If no match is available, the test taker may choose option 99.\nYou may apply early. We will not render a decision until the file is complete. This includes having an official TOEFL score.\nTOEFL must be taken no more than two years before the intended quarter of entry. However, your application will not be disqualified if your scores are a few months out of date.\nAn applicant is evaluated on the basis of the total academic performance, which includes coursework, test scores, research experience, and evaluation by faculty members or applicant’s supervisors. The GRE general test is not required, and the committee will not review GRE scores even if submitted. The only minimum we set is for the TOEFL, on which an international applicant must score 550 or higher on the paper-based test, 213 or higher on the computer-based test, 90 or higher on the internet-based test. On the IELTS, an applicant must score 7.0 or higher.\nYes, you are encouraged to upload copies of your TOEFL score reports along with your application. However, an official decision will not be made until the official scores are received.\nIt most cases we will be able to locate your scores from the other department and it is not necessary to resend them.\nTest scores sent electronically by ETS should automatically match to your application, but sometimes the process goes awry.  We strongly encourage you to upload the score report with your application.  That way, the committee has the information they need even if we never receive official scores.  IELTS scores will take longer if you send a paper copy—again, best to simply upload the score report to your application.  We can use it to verify your scores.\nReturn to Top\nUnofficial copies of transcripts are acceptable for the application. To be considered, all documents not in English must be accompanied by official English translations.\nReturn to Top\nMost PhD students are admitted with research assistantships and/or fellowships. Each research assistantship includes full tuition, a take-home stipend, and health insurance. The stipend amounts are adjusted annually according to inflation.\nMost PhD students are admitted with research assistantships, which will continue as long as funds are available and students are making satisfactory progress towards their degrees.\nBased on the experience of current PhD students, the financial aid is sufficient to cover reasonable living expenses.\nAdditional information about funding is provided on the PhD Program funding page.\nReturn to Top\nAdministrative questions should be directed to the Graduate Program Assistant (emily.blair@northwestern.edu) for the materials science department.\nThe Graduate School offers international PhD students the opportunity to participate in an orientation program called ELP Foundations before beginning their graduate studies. For more information, please visit the ELP Foundations website.\nReturn to Top\nWe encourage all accepted students to visit Northwestern prior to making a decision about the offer. Most students visit during one of two group visits in the spring. Northwestern will pay for most of the expenses associated with these visits. During the visits, students speak with faculty who are of the most interest to them, and learn more about our department and the Evanston/Chicago area. The purpose of these visits is not to arrange for a research adviser, but to get enough information so that you can make an informed choice about which graduate school to attend. Information about visits to the department, whether virtual or in person, will be provided upon admission.\nThe deadline is April 15th, but if you make your decision earlier than that, please let us know.\nNew graduate students arriving in September hear research presentations from each of the faculty members in the department. Students are then given two to three weeks to meet with the faculty whose projects are of the most interest to them. In October, students indicate their adviser preferences. Advisers are then assigned based on these preferences. Alternatively, it may be possible to select an adviser in the Spring before matriculation--see 'preselect' below.\nDue to the nature of research funding, we cannot provide a list of anticipated faculty research openings in Fall. Admitted students are encouraged to ask prospective advisors about their hiring plans.\nOver the past several years, more than 80% of the students have been assigned their first choice for a research adviser, and more than half of the remaining students have been assigned their second choice.\nOur experience is that the adviser selection method described above gives students the most flexibility in finding a research group that is a good match for their own interests. However, in specific cases where the interests of a student are narrowly defined, it may be possible to select an adviser in advance. Students interested in this option should discuss it with the Graduate Admissions Director for the Department of Materials Science and Engineering.\nNorthwestern University does not make decisions related to admissions, including but not limited to financial aid and scholarships, based upon any category protected by the law. The University is committed to complying with all applicable laws. The University believes different perspectives, experiences, and backgrounds are critical to building a dynamic student body, and as such encourages all qualified applicants to apply.\nMSE Admissions 847-491-7896 Email\n• Application\n• Recommendation Letters\n• GRE and TOEFL Scores\n• Transcripts\n• Financial Aid\n• Visiting Northwestern\n• Acceptance\n• Curriculum & Requirements\n• PhD in Materials Science and Engineering\n• Engineering Home\n• MSE Department\n• Academics\n• Graduate Study\n• Materials Science Engineering (PhD)\n• Admissions\n• The Graduate School\n• Graduate Funding\n• International Office\n• Graduate Housing\n• Meet Our Faculty\n• Our Whole-Brain Engineering Philosophy",

Students can pursue master’s degrees in the same department as their bachelor’s or in a different department.\nThe application for the Combined BS/MS Program can be submitted in the quarter prior to a student being within four courses of completing his or her undergraduate degree.\nLearn more about applying to the Combined BS/MS Program\nThe department participates in the McCormick BS/MS program. Students should consult with McCormick Graduate Programs and their MSE adviser and/or the Department Director of Graduate Studies (currently Prof. Shull) to determine if the program is suitable. The decision should be made two quarters before registration for the last course required for the BS degree. Note that undergraduate financial aid is available for 12 quarters or through the completion of the requirements for the BS degree, whichever is first. There are two MS degree options for BS/MS students, as described below:\na) Courses only option: Students take 12 classes beyond those required for the BS. Eight of these classes must be advanced MSE classes listed in the Graduate School Bulletin, and 5 of these must be 400 level MSE classes. All classes must be taken for a grade rather than pass/fail.\nb) Thesis option: Students may extend their 396 Senior Project into a Master’s Thesis to satisfy the requirements of this program. In addition, students must take six advanced classes, listed in the Graduate School Bulletin. At least four of these classes should be MSE classes, with at least 3 being 400-level MSE classes. All classes must be taken for a grade rather than pass/fail.\nThe time required to complete the M.S. thesis research will depend on the student and on the specific project details. The following general guidelines are provided so that the student can design a program with sufficient time to complete a strong thesis. i. In addition to the six classes described above, the student should register for 596 during at least three successive quarters. ii. No more than two additional courses should be taken concurrently with 596 registration.\nFull-time students must write a thesis on their research work and defend it at an oral examination within six quarters (counting summer) after they are enrolled in the MS program.\nThe Department also has an option whereby, in lieu of a thesis, an MS student may submit a paper published (or a manuscript refereed and accepted for publication) in a scientific or technical journal that is based upon research carried out while a grad student in the department. The paper must be approved by the faculty adviser and defended in an oral examination. The MS student should be first author on the paper. If not, a letter from the adviser is required specifying the contribution of the student to the research described. A copy of the paper should be provided for the student’s file.\nIn either case, the examination committee will be composed of the student's faculty adviser plus at least two other faculty members, one of whom may be from another department in the University. The committee is approved by the adviser and appointed by the Department Chair. The student may elect to present a public summary of the research, which is then followed by a private examination by the committee.\nThe Materials Science and Engineering Department must be notified at least 3 weeks before the exam of the names of the committee members and the date, time, and place the exam is to be taken. The student should reserve a suitable conference room and complete the Request for Master’s Degree Defense form. In addition, the student must complete the Application for Degree and Master’s Degree Completion Form on the Caesar website. Each member of the committee must be furnished with a copy of the thesis at least two weeks before the exam, so that the committee will have time to review it. Generally, MS thesis formatting follows the Graduate School’s “Dissertation Formatting Guidelines for Students”\nFor more information about the Combined BS/MS Program, please visit the McCormick School of Engineering website.

They were all eager to teach me everything and really embraced me as part of the team. It was amazing how quickly they brought me up to speed and taught me how everything worked. It felt like I was truly a member of the team.”\n“\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIt [co-op] exposed me to two different sides of my major and narrowed down what I want to do in my future career. I was able to experience both the research side of my major, biomedical engineering, and also the research and development for medical devices. I got to see two different doors. Essentially, that helped me narrow down what I want to do in the future.”\n“\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI built a lot of connections in the industry. It’s a lot easier to do that once you’re inside than from the outside. Having almost a year of experience comes in handy. You really build more meaningful connections in a co-op experience because they are really invested in watching you grow.”\n“\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBeing in a data analyst co-op helped me see what the role actually means and how to be responsible. I think that part is really important. Also, I connected with very amazing coworkers and supervisors.”\n“\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCo-ops presented a really interesting option as I started to look at internships, because you stay at a company longer. The projects you work on are bigger in scope and can last for months, rather than just 10 weeks.”\n“\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tParticipating in co-ops has helped me understand the meaning of my courses a lot better. It helped me see why what I was learning in school was important.”\nWe augment the analytical core of engineering with design, entrepreneurship, leadership, personal development, and unusual collaborations to imagine what's next and take the world in a whole new direction.Learn More\n• TueSep 23Grad Career Lab: Resume Strategies\n• WedSep 24Grad Career Lab: Resume Strategies\n• FriSep 26Northwestern 2025 Tech Career Fair\n• TueSep 30Grad Career Lab: Career Fair + Networking\n[CARD]\nCooperative Engineering Education Program (Co-op)Co-op is an educational program which allows engineering students to alternate periods of academic study with full-time periods of paid work experience related to their academic and professional goals.Explore Co-ops\n[CARD]\nInternshipsInternships offered by the Office of Career Development offer students opportunities to gain practical work experience with employers in industry, commerce, or government.Explore Internships\n[CARD]\nResearch ExperienceStudents who are interested in career paths in research and academia have the opportunity to engage in a formal engineering research experience, either at a university (including Northwestern University) or a government laboratory.Explore Research\n[CARD]\nService LearningThe Projects in Service Learning program offers students have the opportunity to volunteer their time and engineering skills for non-profit organizations.Explore Service Learning\n[CARD]\nConnect with McCormick career advisors, events, and resources\nUse McCormickConnect to view and sign up for ECD events and interviews, schedule appointments with your ECD career advisor, view job listings, and report co-op or internship positions for work-integrated learning.Explore McCormickConnect\n[CARD]\nLook for work and register for Northwestern career events\nHandshake is the central career services platform managed by Northwestern Career Advancement.
