What do you do there?\n[HEADING] How did your master’s degree prepare you for the role?\n[HEADING] What was it like moving to Bristol from China?\n[HEADING] What do you consider to be the most valuable learning or experience you gained from the programme for your personal or professional development?\n[HEADING] What would you say to someone thinking about studying Advanced Composites? Or those who want to work in aerospace?\n[HEADING] Further information\nJuan studied Advanced Composites at the University of Bristol and now works in the aviation industry in China. Find out how her Master’s degree helped prepare her for a successful career.\nMy undergraduate major is Materials Science and Engineering. It’s an interdisciplinary subject that studies the relationship between the preparation technology of materials, the microstructure of materials, and the macroscopic properties of materials. With my postgraduate degree, I wanted to choose a specific area for in-depth research.\nComposites, with its high customisability and integration of design and manufacturing, strongly resonate with my interests. Bristol’s position as a hub for major aviation companies like Rolls-Royce, Airbus, and BAE Systems provided an excellent opportunity to broaden my industry perspective, which further reinforced my decision to study there.\nI’ve been working in the civil aviation industry since I graduated with my Master’s degree from Bristol. First I worked as a Stress Engineer at Airbus China, which meant I needed to verify the structural strength of the A350 wing upper cover (a composite component), now I’m a Design Engineer at Shanghai Aircraft Design and Research Institute (SADRI), Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China ltd (COMAC).\nAs Design Engineer, I’m responsible for the construction and management of the company’s systems to ensure its compliance with airworthiness regulations throughout product development and manufacturing. I establish, optimise and oversee key management systems, such as the Design Assurance System and Production Quality Assurance System, while ensuring seamless integration with other systems. I also coordinate system audits conducted by the Civil Aviation Administration of China for both the company and its suppliers, and manage the resolution of any follow-up issues.\nFrom structural design to management system construction, I am proud to contribute, however modestly, to the growth of China’s civil aviation industry and the global aviation community. This gives my work a deep sense of purpose. I am fortunate to be part of an exceptional team, where my leaders and colleagues offer continuous support and encouragement.\nBristol’s reputation as a world-class institution and one of the most targeted by top UK recruiters significantly helped my resume stand out in corporate recruitment processes.\nPursuing a master’s degree has deepened my professional knowledge and skills compared to my undergraduate experience. Studying Advanced Composites has had a direct and transformative impact on my career readiness by equipping me with the necessary skills for my target role.\nAs an undergraduate student without any prior background in composites, this programme was a pivotal step in shaping my career trajectory. The curriculum objectives are almost perfectly aligned with the skillset needed for positions at Airbus, covering tools such as CATIA and ABAQUS, for computer aided design, and finite element analysis (FEA) software along with fundamental mechanical theories in composite design and manufacturing.\nMoving to Bristol was an exciting and transformative experience. It marked a significant shift not only in geography but also in lifestyle, culture, and approach to education.\nCompared to the fast-paced, high-energy atmosphere of cities like Beijing, Bristol offered a slower, more balanced way of life. The city’s picturesque surroundings, historical architecture, and green spaces provided a refreshing change and encouraged me to explore more outdoor activities. I found that its relaxed and friendly atmosphere brought new feelings to my artistic creation and academic research.\nAdapting to the academic environment at the University of Bristol was another key change. The emphasis on independent research and critical thinking was different from the more structured learning I was used to but, while this shift was initially challenging, it ultimately helped me grow both academically and personally.\nLiving far from home for an extended period provided a unique opportunity for personal growth. From managing daily life to overcoming homesickness, the experience taught me resilience, adaptability, and independence. Engaging with people from all over the world has made my outlook on life gradually more inclusive and open, qualities that are invaluable in my professional journey.\nMy MSc experience at Bristol provided me with a solid technical foundation, practical skills, and valuable industry exposure—benefits that will continue to influence and enrich my professional development.\nThis MSc programme equipped me with a robust foundation in composites design, analysis, and manufacturing. I also gained hands-on experience with cutting-edge tools like FEA software and material testing equipment.\nThese tools and methodologies are essential in stress engineering and design validation, enabling a smooth transition into my role at Airbus. This technical expertise has been pivotal in advancing my understanding of overall aircraft structural design (e.g., C919 at COMAC) and driving research into management system construction.\nStudying in Bristol’s industrial hub, surrounded by various companies gave me unique insights into the aviation industry’s demands. This exposure deepened my understanding of the entire aircraft design and development lifecycle and motivated me to pursue a career as a qualified aircraft design engineer.\nProblem-Solving: The experience of handling coursework and research projects taught me to systematically approach complex engineering challenges.\nTeamwork and Collaboration: Group projects and collaborations at Bristol helped me develop the ability to work effectively in diverse, cross-functional teams, which is crucial for working with regulatory bodies like the Civil Aviation Administration.\nCommunication: My experience in writing technical reports and presenting findings during my MSc improved my skills in documenting and communicating research, skills I now apply in auditing and revising procedure documents.\nFor students who aspire to pursue a master’s degree in the UK and build a career in the aviation industry, my advice is to stay open-minded, actively highlight your strengths, and trust that your time at Bristol will adequately prepare you for your career.\nThe following are some of my thoughts from my life experiences. I hope they resonate with you:\nWhile careers in manufacturing, including aerospace, may not offer the same level of compensation as those in finance or technology, they hold significant importance. Maintaining your passion will help you find a sense of accomplishment, pride, and happiness in your work.\nAs engineers, we often focus on drawings, structures, and numbers. However, the work you’ll do in the future is part of a complex system that requires extensive teamwork and project management. Being proactive in communication can make your efforts much more efficient and impactful.\nSafety is the cornerstone of civil aviation. Reverence for life is something that we need to remember at all times in the future. Improve your expertise and foster a disciplined, detail-oriented approach to learning and work. These habits will form a strong foundation for your future career growth.\nHaving a clear sense of purpose can help you prepare for any career path. Remember that life is a marathon; prioritise long-term growth over immediate successes or setbacks. With perseverance, opportunities will come your way when you least expect them.\nThe professors, lecturers, mentors, and students at the University of Bristol are very friendly and approachable. You will have a wonderful experience and achieve success there.\nThe course information and statements contained within this blog are correct at time of publication.\n• Specialised Knowledge and Research Skills\n• Understanding the Aviation Industry\n• Transferable Skills Development\n• Stay passionate\n• Communicate and collaborate actively\n• Reverence for life and master your expertise\n• Focus on long-term career goals and personal growth\n• Advanced Composites MSc\n• International Funding and Scholarships\n• Science and Engineering facilities at the University of Bristol",

We refer to these skill levels as ‘profiles’. The profile for your chosen course or programme is shown on the course page or programme page.\nThe tests and levels you need to achieve to meet the requirements are on each English language profile page.\nEnglish language proficiency tests should be obtained within two years of the start date of your programme or course.\nIf you are from, or have studied in, an English-speaking country, you may not need to provide additional evidence of your English language ability.\nEnglish language qualifications must be presented in English. If the qualification evidence is not in English you must provide a professional or certified translation, including the contact details for the translator or translation company.\nYou do not need to have reached the required level before you apply.\nWe will look at your academic qualifications and decide what offer we will make you. If you haven’t yet reached the required English level, we will give you a target grade to meet as part of your offer.\nIf you have the required level, you must include it in your application. You do not need to do anything else. If you are a national of an English-speaking country as defined by UK Visas and Immigration, then you may be considered to have the required level. You can find further details, including the list of these countries, in each of our English language profiles.\nIf you haven’t reached the required level for your course or programme, you will be given a target grade in your offer.\nYou will need to provide a valid English language qualification showing you have met the required target grade.\nIf you don’t have the required level, you can try one of the following:\n• Taking a pre-sessional language course offered by the University\n• Taking an IELTS Academic test\n• Taking a different course in your home country which qualifies (see the list under the profile)\n• Re-sitting the language tests in your home country to reach the required level.",
