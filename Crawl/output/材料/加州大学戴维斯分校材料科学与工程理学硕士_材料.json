Students can expect to graduate in four to five years and to work on a large research project, culiminating in a dissertation. The majority of our doctoral graduates end up in industry careers, usually in research and product development positions. Others go on to careers in academia, either as a postdoctoral researcher or an assistant professor. Students enrolled in the doctoral degree have the option to complete a designated emphasis in biophotonics and bioimaging, biotechnology, and/or nuclear science.\nDoctoral students complete two examinations en route to their degrees, the preliminary exam and the qualifying examination, in addition to coursework and a dissertation.\nSee Materials Science & Engineering.",
