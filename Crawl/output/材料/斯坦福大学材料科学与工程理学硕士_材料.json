The following are specific departmental requirements.\nThe Department of Materials Science and Engineering requires a minimum of 45 units for a master’s degree to be taken in residence at Stanford. A Master’s Program Proposal form (PDF) should be filled out, signed by the student’s academic adviser and submitted to the department’s student services manager by the end of the student’s first quarter of study. Final revisions to the master’s program proposal must be submitted no later than one academic quarter prior to the quarter of expected degree conferral. Stanford Materials Science undergraduates who are pursuing or who plan to pursue a coterminal MS degree may have more flexibility in their programs and should consult with their academic advisers regarding appropriate core course and elective choices.\nAll proposed degree programs are subject to approval by the student’s academic adviser and the department’s student services manager, who is responsible for assuring that each proposal is a technically cohesive program. The MS degree is expected to be completed within two years during the university’s candidacy period for completion of a master’s degree.\nStudents wishing to take this option must consult with a MATSCI faculty member initially. Out of the 45 units of MS degree requirements, 9-15 units may be taken in Materials Science master’s research by enrolling in MATSCI 200. Students using 15 units of research toward the degree must participate in a more complex and demanding research project than those using lesser units.\nThe MS thesis report must be approved and signed off by two faculty members. In general, one is student’s research adviser, if adviser is a non MATSCI faculty member, a second MATSCI faculty is required to sign off on the thesis report. Consult with student services manager about faculty criteria and requirements. Three copies of the MS thesis report in final format should be submitted to two faculty advisers and to the department. The report is not an official university thesis but is intended to demonstrate to the department and faculty student’s ability to conduct and report a directed research project.\nAs a general guideline, 9 to 12 units of master’s research is a normal load for most students. The report should reflect the number of units taken. For instance, three to four laboratory reports are required for a 3-unit laboratory course. Accordingly, the level expected for 9 units of research would be at least equivalent to three such courses.\nStudents are advised to submit their thesis draft to faculty adviser readers by the end of fifth week of the quarter in which the units are to be assigned to allow time for faculty comments and revisions. A collated final version of the thesis report should be submitted to the faculty and student services office by the last day of classes of the student’s graduation quarter. The appropriate grade for satisfactory progress in the research project prior to submission of the final report is ‘N’ (continuing); the ‘S’ (Satisfactory) final grade is given only when the report is fully approved and signed off by both faculty members.\nIn cases where students decide to pursue research after the initial program submission deadline, they should submit a revised MS Program Proposal at least two quarters before the degree is granted. The total combined units of Materials Science research units, seminars, language courses and undergraduate courses cannot exceed 15. If a master’s thesis report is not submitted, units in MATSCI 200 Master’s Research cannot be applied to the department’s requirement of 45 units for the conferral of the master’s degree.\nNewly-admitted MatSci MS students (as well as other admitted or current students) are invited to take their first Stanford classes online during the Summer quarter prior to arrival on campus.  Summer classes begin in late June, are offered 100% online, and can be accessed worldwide.  Taking classes during Summer gives students the opportunity to complete graduate classes while off campus, and may allow students to graduate earlier.  A list of classes offered in Summer can be found on the CGOE webpage, and may be eligible for elective/core units.\n• A minimum of 21 units of Materials Science and Engineering (MATSCI) course work, including core and lab courses specified below, all taken for a letter grade. Research units, one-unit seminars, MATSCI 299 Practical Training and courses in other departments (i.e., where students cannot enroll in a class with a MATSCI subject code) cannot be counted for this requirement.\n• Of these 21 units of Materials Science requirements, students must include either options.Option One: Three classes from MATSCI 211-215 core courses and four MATSCI 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, and 176 laboratory courses. One of the lab requirements may be replaced by a STEM lab course outside the department with prior advisor approval.Option Two: Four classes from MATSCI 211-215 core courses and three MATSCI 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, and 176 laboratory courses. One of the lab requirements may be replaced by a STEM lab course outside the department with prior advisor approval.\n• Option One: Three classes from MATSCI 211-215 core courses and four MATSCI 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, and 176 laboratory courses.

      "content": "[HEADING] Graduate Degree Requirements\n[HEADING] Summary\n[HEADING] Policy Statement\n[HEADING] Completing requirements in the two weeks before Autumn Quarter\n[HEADING] Contact Information\nFor each Stanford advanced degree, there is an approved course of study that meets University and department requirements. The University's general requirements, applicable to all graduate degrees at Stanford, are described below. University requirements pertaining to only a subset of advanced degrees are described in the Master's Degree Requirements or Doctoral Degree Requirements pages of this Bulletin.\nGraduate education at Stanford is a full-time commitment requiring full-time enrollment, typically at least eight units in each academic quarter. Unless permission is granted by the degree program (for example, for field work) enrolled graduate students are required to maintain a significant physical presence on campus throughout each quarter a student is enrolled. Prior to requesting approval to be physically distanced from campus, students should consult with the degree program as well as other university offices about potential funding, visa or other implications. Degree programs and individual faculty should include expectations about physical presence on campus in the advising expectations that are made available to students (see GAP 3.3, Academic Advising).\nWhen considering a student’s request to be physically remote, the degree program should carefully consider the student’s ability to meet the coursework, research and teaching requirements of the program such that they can make satisfactory academic progress. In cases where the student is not able to make satisfactory academic progress and meet the requirements of the program, a leave of absence may be appropriate. Degree programs are not obligated to approve a student’s request to be away from campus.\nGraduate students are required to enroll in courses for all terms of the regular academic year (Autumn, Winter, and Spring quarters) from the admission term until conferral of the degree. The only exception to this requirement occurs when the student is granted an official leave of absence (see GAP 5.3, Leaves of Absence, and GAP 5.4, Program Discontinuation and Reinstatement).\nMatriculated graduate students are expected to enroll for at least eight units during the academic year; degree programs may set a higher minimum. Petitions for programs of fewer than 8 must be signed by the student’s degree program and submitted for consideration to the Office of the Registrar. Graduate students are normally expected to enroll in no more than 24 units. (Students in programs in the Schools of Humanities & Sciences, Engineering, Earth Sciences and Education will pay tuition for each unit over 18. The Schools of Medicine, Law, and Business do not charge for units above 18.) Registration for more than 24 units must be approved by the degree program.\nRequests to enroll for fewer than eight units during the academic year are approved only in specific circumstances, including enrollment in the Master of Liberal Arts (M.L.A.) program, or the Honors Cooperative Program (HCP) through the Stanford Center for Professional Development (the Honors Cooperative Program). See GAP 5.2, Part-Time Enrollment.\nFailure to enroll in courses for a term during the academic year without taking an approved leave of absence results in denial of further enrollment privileges unless and until reinstatement to the degree program is granted and the reinstatement fee paid.\nRegistration in Summer quarter is not required and does not substitute for registration during the academic year. Degree programs may require students to enroll in the Summer quarter. Students possessing an F-1 or J-1 student visa may be subject to additional course enrollment requirements in order to retain their legal status in the United States.\nIn addition to the above requirement for continuous registration during the academic year, graduate students are required by Stanford to be registered:\nIn each term during which any official degree program or university requirement is fulfilled, including qualifying exams or the university oral exam. The period between the last day of final exams of one term and the day prior to the first day of the following term is considered an extension of the earlier term, with the option of considering the two weeks preceding the start of Autumn Quarter as part of Autumn Quarter (rather than as part of Summer Quarter).\nIn any term in which a dissertation/thesis is submitted or at the end of which a graduate degree is conferred.\nNormally, in any term in which the student receives financial support.\nIn any term for which the student needs to use university facilities.\nFor international students, in any term of the regular academic year (summer may be excluded) for which they have non-immigrant status (i.e., a J-1 or F-1 visa).\nIndividual students may also find themselves subject to the registration requirements of other agencies (for example, external funding sources such as federal financial aid). Most course work and research are expected to be done on campus unless the degree program gives prior approval.\nDegree programs have the option to include the two weeks before the start of Autumn Quarter as part of Autumn Quarter for the purposes of completing milestones and programmatic requirements. The following considerations apply to this exception:\nThe student must enroll in the subsequent Autumn Quarter in the applicable standard enrollment category prior to the completion of the milestone; a leave of absence is not permitted for that Autumn Quarter.\nA student exercising this option will not be eligible for Graduation Quarter status until the following Winter Quarter at the earliest.\nThis exception is permitted only for milestones administered by the degree program, such as qualifying examinations or university oral examinations.\nThis exception does not apply to deadlines administered through Stanford University, such as filing the Application to Graduate, or Dissertation/Thesis submission.\nDegree programs are not obligated to exercise this option solely because a student requests it.\nOffice of the University Registrar\n• In each term during which any official degree program or university requirement is fulfilled, including qualifying exams or the university oral exam.
