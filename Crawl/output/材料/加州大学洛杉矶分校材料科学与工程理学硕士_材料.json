Applicants who have a bachelor's degree in chemistry, physics, or other engineering disciplines may be admitted if an introductory materials course has been taken or remedial work comparable to an introductory course is performed.\nApplicants not having adequate preparation may be admitted provisionally and may be required to undertake certain remedial coursework which cannot be applied toward the degree. On arrival at UCLA, an adviser helps the student plan a program which can remedy any such deficiencies.\nPh.D.: Applicants to the Ph.D. program should have completed the requirements for the master's degree with at least a 3.25 grade-point average and have demonstrated creative ability. Normally the M.S. degree is not required for admission to the Ph.D. program.

However, submitting GRE scores is highly encouraged for PhD applicants.\nLetters of Recommendation\n3\nUCLA-Wide Graduate Admissions Requirements\nSee UCLA's minimum requirements for all graduate program applicants.\nDegree-Specific Admissions Requirements\nIn addition to the University's minimum requirements and those listed above, all applicants are expected to submit a resume and a statement of purpose.\nM.S.: Applicants to the M.S. program in Materials Science and Engineering are required to hold a bachelor's degree in materials science, metallurgy, or ceramics. Applicants who have a bachelor's degree in chemistry, physics, or other engineering disciplines may be admitted if an introductory materials course has been taken or remedial work comparable to an introductory course is performed.\nApplicants not having adequate preparation may be admitted provisionally and may be required to undertake certain remedial coursework which cannot be applied toward the degree. On arrival at UCLA, an adviser helps the student plan a program which can remedy any such deficiencies.\nPh.D.: Applicants to the Ph.D. program should have completed the requirements for the master's degree with at least a 3.25 grade-point average and have demonstrated creative ability. Normally the M.S. degree is not required for admission to the Ph.D. program. Although the GRE is not required, it is highly encouraged.\nProgram Name | Materials Science and Engineering\n\nMaterials Science and Engineering is a program in the Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science.\nLeading to thedegree of | M.S., Ph.D.\nMajor Code | 0328\nAddress | 420 Westwood Plaza 3111 Engineering V\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t   Box 951595 Los Angeles, CA 90095-1595\nPhone | (310) 825-8913\nEmail | mseadmis@seas.ucla.edu\nWebsite | mse.ucla.edu",
