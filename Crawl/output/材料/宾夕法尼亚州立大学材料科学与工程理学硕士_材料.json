By remaining at the forefront of technology innovations, this center, the Laboratory for Research on the Structure of Matter (LRSM), has grown to be one of the largest in the nation. We are opening up new fields in materials science, preparing tomorrow’s leaders, and putting our knowledge to practical use in today’s high-tech society.  Our multidisciplinary program allows you to tailor your education to your own professional and career goals, from ceramics, polymers, and metals to non-structured and soft materials.  Our graduates can be found in positions in industries that range from electronics, manufacturing, and communications to transportation and energy, or pursuing doctoral degrees at Penn and other top-ranked research universities.\nFor more information: https://mse.seas.upenn.edu/\n10 course units are required for the MSE in Materials Science and Engineering.1-5\nA maximum of two free electives (5000 level or higher) are permitted. Free electives can be selected from across the university, including SEAS, SAS and Wharton courses. Free electives are not permitted for students pursuing a dual degree at Penn.\nDuring the first semester, Masters degree students are not permitted to take Independent Study or Master's Thesis and are required to enroll in only MSE courses.\nAll Masters degree students must maintain a GPA of 2.7 or higher to be in good standing and for graduation. Students are required to attend weekly MSE seminars organized by the department as part of their education and exposure to latest scientific advances\nNote that only one Engineering Entrepreneurship course will count as a MSE related SEAS-course. A second entrepreneurship course will be counted as a free elective. A student who takes two free electives and EAS 5100 will be permitted to take CIT 5900 only if the student has also taken six MSE courses. This is done to ensure that at least 60% of the courses that count towards the Master's degree have physical science content and preferably MSE content.\nThe degree and major requirements displayed are intended as a guide for students entering in the Fall of 2025 and later. Students should consult with their academic program regarding final certifications and requirements for graduation.\nPrint this page.\nThe PDF will include all information unique to this page.\n• Skip to Content\n• AZ Index\n• Catalog Home\n• Institution Home\n• Home/\n• Graduate Catalog/\n• School of Engineering and Applied Science/\n• Programs/\n• Materials Science and Engineering, MSE\n• Non-thesis course-based option: Students successfully complete 10 course units at the 5000 or higher level.

At Penn GSE, students and faculty enjoy an Ivy League environment that supports both practical knowledge building and high-quality research. Our alumni are recognized as some of the world’s most influential education leaders, and our distinguished professors are pioneers in their fields.\nOur Mission: Penn GSE partners with schools, universities, and communities to expand educational access – especially for those underserved by society. Through rigorous research and innovative programs, we develop new knowledge, and transformational teachers and leaders in pursuit of educational opportunity.\nWhat began with the appointment of one professor in 1894 evolved into a top-ranked professional school of education. We have a 100-year legacy of producing education leaders through innovative ideas, passionate people, and a commitment to making a difference. With 40 standing faculty and just over 1,300 students, Penn GSE is a small school with remarkable scholarly productivity and influence.\nPenn GSE offers a vibrant array of high-quality degree programs in education research and practice. Our programs prepare students for careers as urban and international educators, school leaders, education researchers, higher education professionals, school psychologists, reading specialists, and more. In addition to degree programs, we offer professional development opportunities and certificates within the field of education.\nRenowned for our expertise in urban education, policy research, quantitative methods, practitioner inquiry, developmental psychology, and qualitative analysis, Penn GSE provides rigorous academic training and professional mentoring to help our students become effective leaders. Graduates of our innovative and interdisciplinary programs are shaping the future of education.\nFor more information: https://www.gse.upenn.edu/\nPenn GSE emphasizes the interplay of theory, research, and practice in everything we do, believing that education research produces knowledge to inform practice, but also that research must be informed by the issues, needs, and concerns of practitioners. We are recognized for our strengths in research on urban education, policy, teaching and learning, the cultural contexts of education, language education, qualitative analysis, practitioner inquiry, developmental psychology, and quantitative and multimethod inquiry.\nPenn GSE is home to several faculty-run centers that produce cutting-edge research on global issues in education. Additionally, the School’s many practice-driven initiatives put innovative practices, strategies, and tools directly into the hands of practitioners, both in Philadelphia and across the globe.\nFor more information: https://www.gse.upenn.edu/academics/research\nPenn GSE’s world-class faculty and researchers—the intellectual heart of our School— have a major impact on education research and practice across the globe. This influential faculty answer vital questions and solve pressing problems in local, national, and global education. From literacy to college access to the Common Core, our researchers are leading the conversation about critical issues in education.\nOur professors possess particular strengths in teaching and learning, the cultural contexts of education, language education, qualitative research methods, and practitioner inquiry. In recent years, these strengths have deepened to include national leadership in policy research, urban education, developmental psychology, and quantitative and multimethod inquiry.\nFor more information: https://www.gse.upenn.edu/academics\nPHILADELPHIA\nOur commitment to active, on-the-ground engagement in Philadelphia is a reflection of the University-wide values expressed in the Penn Compact 2022. Penn GSE is not just located in Philadelphia—it is of Philadelphia. We partner with schools in small and large ways to work towards social justice—always endeavoring to leverage the expertise of the larger research university in service of a better education for all.\nThe University of Pennsylvania's Graduate School of Education is deeply involved in Philadelphia schools. It is crucial to our mission that Penn GSE faculty and students engage in all levels of education, both formal and informal, in traditional and alternative settings, to better learn how we can solve the challenges of urban education and contribute to the growth and well-being of our citizens. More than a third of our faculty work in or with Philadelphia public schools on issues ranging from improving the quality of writing instruction to teaching coding as part of the elementary school curriculum.\nIn any given year, we are involved in about 500 activities in almost 250 schools across Philadelphia. Additionally, we take part in over 70 community activities in over 65 locations.\nFor more information: View an interactive map of our activities in Philadelphia.\nINTERNATIONAL\nThe University of Pennsylvania nurtures global networks and encourages innovative, cross-disciplinary research to better understand and resolve global issues. As part of this campus-wide initiative, Penn GSE students research, study, teach, and work across the globe, and over 70% of our standing faculty members are involved in international initiatives. Penn GSE also offers several academic programs that focus on international education or offer students the opportunity to study abroad.\nThe Global Engagement Office at Penn GSE directly supports the mission of the School and the University in engaging in a sustained and meaningful way with issues of global importance. The aim is to increase GSE’s impact and widen its reach by supporting faculty, students and staff who work across borders and by encouraging partnerships with educational institutions in other nations. It also serves as an initial point of contact for scholars and agencies looking for opportunities and expertise to address strategic issues in teaching and learning.\nFor more information: https://www.gse.upenn.edu/about-penn-gse/global-initiatives\nPrint this page.\nThe PDF will include all information unique to this page.\n• Skip to Content\n• AZ Index\n• Catalog Home\n• Institution Home\n• Home/\n• Graduate Catalog/\n• Graduate School of Education",
