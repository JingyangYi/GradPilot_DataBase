If this is the case we will let you know.\nApplications received after our final application deadline will be considered at our discretion if places are still available.\nPlease note: All places are subject to availability and if you apply at one of the later stages, some courses may already be closed. We therefore recommend that you apply early in the cycle to secure your place with us.\nApplicants who are made a conditional offer of a place must demonstrate that they have met all the conditions of their offer by       31st July 2025.\nWe require the following documents before we can consider your application.\n*Latest transcripts of study showing all modules completed including credit weighting and grades achieved\n*If you have not yet graduated, a list of the modules that you will be completing in the final year of your degree together with their credit weighting\n*An official document from your university verifying your current weighted average mark if this information is not included in your transcript of study. Please note : this must be recorded as a percentage, not as a GPA grade, and must give the weighted average mark, not an arithmetic average mark\n*We require a reference from someone who has knowledge of your academic ability in support of your application.  In most cases this should be an academic reference, from a lecturer or professor at your last/current university.  In some cases (for example, if your academic studies occurred some time ago) it might be more appropriate to submit a recommendation from someone who is familiar with your professional experience.  If you have difficulty in identifying a suitable referee you should ask for advice from the admissions team.  We will contact the referee directly after you submit your application and direct them to complete our online reference form.\n*Degree certificate if you have already graduated.\n*Curriculum vitae (CV) if you graduated more than three years ago.\nIf English is not your first language, we also require proof of your English language ability.

If any of the above information is missing, we will not be able to consider your application and it will be rolled forward to the next stage or withdrawn.\nWe consider your full academic history including which course units you have taken and the marks obtained. Even if you have met our minimum entry requirements, we will take into account your marks in relevant course units in our final decision making.\nIf you graduated more than three years ago, we will also consider the information contained on your CV and any relevant work experience you have to assess if you are still able to fulfil the entry criteria.\nCAS Information\nPlease upload a copy of your current valid passport with your application showing the photograph page with your application. For CAS purposes, this must show your full name, date of birth, nationality, passport number and the date the passport is valid until, which must be later than the date of your planned arrival in the UK, and the start date of your course.\nIf you have previously studied in the UK on a Student visa as an undergraduate or postgraduate student, please send a copy of your previous CAS statement to us as it will assist with the issue of your new CAS statement. This includes study in the UK on study abroad programmes and any study that you did not complete.\nYou cannot use your CAS to apply for a visa more than       three months before the start date\n of your course. The Admissions Team will contact you at the appropriate time.\nYour CAS number is only valid for one Student Route application.\nATAS Information\nYou should apply for an ATAS clearance certificate if your course requires it, unless you're exempt because you're a national of the UK, EU, EEA, Switzerland, Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea or the USA.\nYour Student Route Visa application, or extension of stay, will automatically be refused if you need an ATAS certificate and cannot provide one. For further guidance on obtaining an ATAS certificate, please see the information in our       ATAS guidance\n.\nPlease do not apply for ATAS until contacted by your admissions team, as the information required is subject to change.\nFailure to obtain a correct ATAS certificate will prevent our ability to issue a CAS (Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies).\n• View tabs\n• View full page\n[GRID_TABLE]\nAttend an open day\nDownload our course brochure",
