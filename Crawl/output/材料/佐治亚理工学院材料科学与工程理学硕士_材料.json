Minor\nUndergraduate Embedded\nUndergraduate embedded certificates are intended to encourage students to use the elective course requirements in their degree program to form a coherent package of coursework in a specified area.\nUndergraduate embedded certificates will be granted only to students who, in addition to the undergraduate embedded certificate program requirements, have satisfied requirements for an undergraduate degree. The offering unit is responsible for verifying satisfaction of all undergraduate embedded certificate requirements, as well as completion of an undergraduate degree. Undergraduate embedded certificates are not recorded on the student's transcript or diploma.

The offering unit is responsible for verifying satisfaction of all graduate embedded certificate requirements, as well as completion of a graduate degree. Graduate embedded certificates are not recorded on the student's transcript or diploma. Arrangements must be made for awarding graduate embedded certificates within colleges or offering units. Graduate embedded certificates will not be awarded at the Institute level.\nGraduate Embedded Certificate Guidelines\nGraduate Stand-Alone\nStand-alone certificates may be completed independent of students being enrolled as Master’s or Doctoral student. These certificates represent a cohesive program of study of a smaller size than a Master’s program and provide more flexibility to professionals for pursing graduate education, including a means for professionals to renew and retrain due to a fast-changing work force. When completed, these certificates appear on the student’s academic record (transcript), and the student receives a certificate of completion.\nGraduate Stand-Alone Certificate Guidelines\nOnce graduate stand-alone certificate programs are approved by the Institute, they will be listed here.\nThis site uses cookies.

Minors are intended to broaden the student's education by encouraging and officially recognizing knowledge obtained by the student in fields other than their major or in fields that may be sub-fields of their major which covers a broad range of academic disciplines.\nMinors are typically offered by Schools which also offer a major. It is expected that there will be depth of the program of study and that stated educational objectives will be met upon completion of the minor.\nSome minors are offered where there is no undergraduate granting program at Georgia Tech. An academic unit could offer a minor in a field where it does not offer a major. Minors may also be offered collaboratively by multiple academic units.  Note that students from some majors may not be allowed to pursue certain minors when the major or minor program deems the overlap to be excessive or inappropriate. Students are strongly encouraged to check with their major advisor before choosing to pursue a minor.\nClick here for a list of minors offered at Georgia Tech. All undergraduate minor requirements are also available in DegreeWorks.\nThe program of study for each minor must satisfy the curricular requirements listed below. However, some minors, at the discretion of the offering academic unit(s) and approval from the Institute Undergraduate Curriculum Committee, may be exempt from some of these requirements, may exceed some requirements, and/or add additional requirements. Minor programs of study must be in compliance with the University System of Georgia requirements for the undergraduate minor (see items 1-3 below). The University System of Georgia parameters for Minors can be found on their website at: Academic & Student Affairs Handbook | 2.3 Academic Programs | University System of Georgia (usg.edu).\nStudents should consult the GT Catalog for the list of minors offered and their requirements. They should contact their academic advisor in their major with specific questions. The academic advisor in the major may refer the question to the Registrar’s Office for more information or direction.\nThis site uses cookies. Review the Privacy & Legal Notice.

However, some minors have specific breadth requirements that may limit double-counting of credits between the minor and the major program(s). Core IMPACTS courses are restricted from counting per USG.\n• Minors may specify course substitutions to prevent inappropriate overlap with particular major degree requirements. These exclusions and/or substitutions should be clearly detailed in the minor’s catalog description.\n• Some minors may only be open to students from specific majors. Other minors may not be open to students from some closely aligned majors. Students should consult with the minor advisor or the GT catalog for further information.\n• Each minor program will decide how many credits of special-topics classes or project-oriented classes (Special Problems, Undergraduate Research, VIP, etc.) can be counted within the minor program. In general, it is expected that a minor program will only allow 6 or fewer credits of Special Topics courses in order to ensure the consistency and availability of elective classes within the minor.\n• Each program will decide how many credit hours of transfer credit may be used to satisfy the course requirements for the minor. In general, it is expected that a minor program will only allow up to 3 hours of transfer credit. This includes coursework taken at another institution or credit earned through the AP or IB program, assuming the scores meet Georgia Tech minimum standards.\n• A maximum of 3 credit hours can be shared with another minor.\n• All courses counting toward the minor must be taken on a letter-grade basis.\n• All courses used to satisfy the course requirements for a minor must be completed with a grade of C or above.\n• A student should select a minor in consultation with an advisor in their major field of study.\n• The student should also consult with an advisor in the minor field of study who can inform and advise the student about the specific requirements of the minor. Some of these may be different than the requirements listed above.\n• Students can declare a minor at any time, although it must be done by the time or at the time the student applies to graduate. However, it is recommended that students declare a minor as soon as they have made the decision so that they can monitor their progress using the online degree audit and with their advisor. Declaration of the minor also provides information to the relevant academic units that is helpful in planning courses. The minor declaration form is on the Registrar's Office website at: http://www.registrar.gatech.edu/students/formlanding/changeminor.php.\n• The minor is conferred at the same time the major degree is conferred. The major degree and minor will be recorded on the student's transcript. The minor will not appear on the student's diploma.\n• Minors will not be conferred retroactively upon students who have graduated.\n• All proposals for a minor must originate from the faculty of the academic unit(s) offering the minor. Minors may originate in several ways, such as:\n\t\na minor in a field in which Georgia Tech offers a degree program through a single academic unit (College/School),\na minor, in which the subject matter is covered by multiple degree granting academic programs in multiple academic units (Colleges/Schools),\na minor in a coherent area of intellectual inquiry in which there is no undergraduate degree-granting program at Georgia Tech. In this case, the offering academic unit(s) must have in place sufficient courses, faculty, and facilities.\n• a minor in a field in which Georgia Tech offers a degree program through a single academic unit (College/School),\n• a minor, in which the subject matter is covered by multiple degree granting academic programs in multiple academic units (Colleges/Schools),\n• a minor in a coherent area of intellectual inquiry in which there is no undergraduate degree-granting program at Georgia Tech.

These courses will be awarded elective credit.\nCommon elective courses awarded are HUM 1XXX/2XXX, SS 1XXX/2XXX, and FREE 1XXX. Department specific elective credit may also be awarded such as PHYS 2XXX, BIOS 1XXX, etc.\nThese courses are considered elective credit and do not directly replace a Georgia Tech course. For example, PHYS 2XXX is not equal to any 2000-level physics course.\nStudents will need to work with their academic advisors to determine how the elective credit can be used to meet degree requirements.\nGeorgia Tech also awards Transfer Math Credit. Transfer Math is awarded when the content of the transfer course aligns with Georgia Tech’s course but is not equivalent in credit hours (ex. Multivariable Calculus course completed was 3 credit hours but Georgia Tech’s course is 4 credit hours).

      "content": "[HEADING] Catalog\n[HEADING] Vertically Integrated Projects Program\n[HEADING] Print Options\nThrough the Vertically Integrated Projects (VIP) Program, students work with faculty on large-scale, long term multidisciplinary project teams. Students earn academic credit and can participate for multiple semesters, with returning students taking on mentoring, leadership, and/or additional responsibilities relevant to their fields of study. “Vertical Integration” refers to team composition, with teams including sophomores, juniors, seniors, graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, and faculty. Faculty build VIP teams around their own interests, so they bring their expertise and enthusiasm to their teams. In turn, VIP teams attract students from many disciplines and enable the completion of ambitious projects, which strengthen and expand faculty portfolios. Teams are established by faculty request and last many years (if not indefinitely). Because each team lasts longer than any single student, new students get up to speed on the project each semester, and returning students help mentor newcomers. The long-term nature of the program provides the time and context for students to gain deeper insights into their field of study, acquire breadth by working with people from other disciplines and backgrounds, learn and practice professional skills, make substantial contributions to real-world projects and experience different roles and responsibilities on at team.\nVIP is offered as a set of courses, with new students joining at the beginning of each semester. Students must apply to VIP before they can register for the appropriate courses. This ensures that returning students are able to register, and it allows VIP to maintain a balance of sophomores, juniors, seniors and graduate students as well as a balance of different majors on each team. The program actively recruits students prior to Phase I registration. Students can apply the semester before they join a team (for example, applying before Phase I registration to join a team the following semester), or as late as the first week of class for on-campus students or the month before class for online students (see www.vip.gatech.edu for deadlines). Teams do fill up, so students are encouraged to apply before Phase I registration if they are interested in a specific team.\nIn the application, students are asked to indicate which team they would like to join and how many credit-hours they would like to take. Sophomores are limited to 1 credit-hour.  Juniors and seniors can take 1 to 2 credit-hours. Students using VIP to fulfill a multi-semester design sequence can take 3 credit-hours in their third semester of the sequence.  Graduate students can take 1-3 credit-hours. Students who are being paid by an instructor to participate, such as undergraduate student employees and graduate student mentors, register for zero credits. This appears on the student schedules as a 1-credit audit courses. Students using VIP for the President’s Undergraduate Research Award program should indicate this on the application, and will register for 1-3 audit credits. Each applicant can only apply to one team at a time. If the team is unable to accept them, the student can apply to another team. If a student applies to another team while an application is pending, the new application will overwrite the previous application.\nThe VIP Program does not allow students to freely switch from team to team. As a disincentive, students are typically asked to take a one-semester break between participation on one team and another. Students seeking an exception to this rule should provide a detailed explanation in the comments section in the online application.\nAfter students are accepted, the VIP Program will issue a registration permit. One-credit-hour students will need only one course registration number (CRN), which they will receive via email when their permit is issued. Two and 3-credit-hour students will need two CRNs, one for the scheduled meeting (1 credit, CRN emailed when the permit is issued), and another CRN for a 1 or 2-credit unsupervised lab. The lab CRNs are listed each semester on the VIP webpage.\nEach VIP team meets once weekly, typically for 50 minutes. Teams also schedule subteam meetings, allowing smaller groups working on a specific topic to collaborate at other times during the week. Students in their first semester of VIP cannot have a time-conflict with the scheduled team meeting.  Returning VIP students can have a time conflict with instructor approval, if subteam meetings outside of regular meetings would allow the student to fully participate and contribute. It is the student’s responsibility to confirm with the instructor if a time-conflict is acceptable (regardless of whether a time-conflict permit was issued), to ensure the time conflict is manageable, and to actively engage with their team.\nSome VIP teams allow online students to participate. This is most common in the Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) program. Team listings on the VIP webpage indicate which teams will consider OMSCS students, either in general (synchronously), asynchronously or on a case-by-case basis. Online students interested in a team considering OMSCS applicants on a case-by-case basis should contact the instructor to discuss their interest and options. In other situations, students already associated with a VIP team might participate while doing a co-op, internship, or study abroad. These requests should be made to instructors. Then with instructor approval, the special sections will be created by the VIP Program.\nMany departments have policies about how VIP credits can be applied to degree requirements. Some departments incentivize multiple semesters of participation, allowing VIP credits to count in a more useful way once a minimum number of credits are earned (e.g., all VIP credits might count as in-major electives once 6 VIP credits are earned). In some departments, VIP projects can be used to fulfill multi-semester design sequences such as Junior Design, Senior Design, or Studio. While departments develop and approve the policies, the VIP Program lists the policies at www.vip.gatech.edu for students’ convenience. It is important for each student to understand their department’s policy. Students with questions about their departments’ policies should contact their academic advisors in their home departments. Appeals to department policies are handled by students’ home departments.\nThis site uses cookies. Review the Privacy & Legal Notice.

      "content": "[HEADING] Catalog\n[HEADING] Georgia Tech Career Center\n[HEADING] Print Options\nGeorgia Tech believes that obtaining relevant, academically related experience outside of the classroom is an integral part of the educational process. The Career Center offers opportunities to obtain such experience through cooperative education and internships.\nThe Undergraduate Cooperative Plan (Co-op) has been offered at Georgia Tech since 1912. It offers students the opportunity to integrate practical experience with theory learned in the classroom. Many students participate each semester, working full time during alternating semesters, for a total of three semesters, for employers throughout the United States.\nThe Undergraduate Co-op Plan is available for students in all majors. Co-op students remain enrolled in school while on work terms by registering for the appropriate co-op courses.\nThe work experience received is a valuable asset to graduates starting out in their chosen professions. Neither college laboratory experience nor employment during vacations can take the place of organized co-op experience. The plan provides, to a substantial degree, the experience most companies require of their employees before promoting them to positions of higher responsibility. Work experience may also assist students who are undecided about their future career goals by determining early in their college careers whether they wish to continue in a particular field.\nInternships provide practical experience for students who choose not to follow the Undergraduate Co-op Plan. Internships, the majority of which are paid positions, are an extremely viable way to obtain out-of-classroom experience. Similar to cooperative education, the jobs and the students' performance are monitored by the Career Center to ensure maximum benefit by all parties.\nStudents in all majors may participate in the internship program and may work any term during the academic year. There are also part-time internships available for those who wish to work while attending classes.\nProgram Eligibility for Co-ops and Internships:\nStudents are required to register their co-op terms with the Career Center and are enrolled in the CO-OP (tuition-free) 12 audit hour course. Students securing internships are also strongly encouraged to register these opportunities with the Career Center. Students will be registered in the INTN audit hours course based on the number of total work hours per week, as follows:\n10-19 hours per week = 3-hour audit course\n20-29 hours per week = 6-hour audit course\n30-35 hours per week = 9-hour audit course\n36+ hours per week = 12-hour audit course\nBenefits of CO-OP and INTN Course Enrollment:\nFor more information on co-ops and internships, visit our website, email us at careercenter@gatech.edu or call the Career Center at 404-894-3320.\nThis site uses cookies.

Transfer Credit\n[HEADING] D. Double Counting Credit between Master’s Degrees\n[HEADING] Print Options\nThe faculty of Georgia Tech grants stand-alone graduate certificates, master’s degrees, and doctoral degrees. The goals for graduate education are to establish an educational environment that will strengthen students’ personal and professional development, to encourage students and faculty to pursue the discovery and generation of new knowledge through research, to investigate ways of applying such knowledge for the benefit of society and humanity, and to foster the development of new tools, objects, and ideas.\nStudents whose interests and aptitudes lead them beyond the limits of the traditional undergraduate curriculum may broaden their knowledge of a given field and pursue independent inquiry through graduate study. A graduate education is of particular benefit to students interested in careers in research, management, development, design, or consulting; to those who aspire to formulate and administer policy; and to those who desire careers in higher education\nFull-time students must be enrolled for at least 12 credit hours on a letter grade or pass/fail basis. As an exception, the advisor and school chair may allow up to three hours out of the minimum 12 to be taken on an audit basis in fall and spring semesters; in summer semesters, the advisor and school chair may allow up to six hours out of the 12 minimum to be taken on an audit basis. Hours in excess of the required 12 may be taken on any basis. Full-time students working exclusively on thesis research should be registered for 18 or more hours of 7000 or 9000 level courses (master's or doctoral thesis courses) in fall and spring semesters, and for up to 16 hours during summer semesters.\nThe maximum load for graduate students in good standing is 21 hours in fall/spring and 16 hours in summer. The minimum load is three hours, except for the semester of graduation. During the semester of graduation, a student is permitted to register for only one hour of master’s or doctoral thesis courses (7000 or 9000). This exception may be used only once for each degree.\nStudents with fellowships, graduate research or teaching assistantships, traineeships, tuition waivers, or student visas, and those assigned to the Institute by the armed forces for the purpose of pursuing a degree are required to enroll full time. Part-time doctoral students engaged in research for their Ph.D.s should meet the minimum enrollment requirement and register for the number of 9000 level hours consistent with the time they and their faculty advisors spend on the dissertation research.\nThe Institute Graduate Curriculum Committee, with the approval of the Academic Faculty Senate, is responsible for establishing academic policy for the graduate programs; however, final authority rests with the Senate. This committee reserves the right to change requirements for degrees as may be appropriate. Students enrolled at the time such changes appear in the catalog have the privilege of following either the regulations stated in the catalog effective the semester in which they enrolled or the regulations in the catalog that records the change.\nThis catalog records the Institute-wide policies and regulations that govern the graduate programs. Schools may make additional rules concerning their programs and the pursuit of their degrees, but such rules may not contradict Institute policies and regulations.\nA student may not apply for transfer credit until after matriculation at Georgia Tech. The courses to be transferred would typically be those appearing on the approved program of study form for the master's degree. A doctoral student normally does not request transfer credit. The rules relative to and the process for obtaining transfer of credit for graduate-level courses are as follows:\nStudents who are pursuing two master’s degrees at Georgia Tech may double count a maximum of 6 hours of credit for both degrees. This ensures that each degree involves a minimum of 24 hours of coursework completed at Tech that is not double counted.\nThe six-hour limit may be exceeded when specifically allowed as a component of an approved degree program.\nThis site uses cookies.

If official transcripts have not been received prior to the last day of the Registration Period, the student seeking readmission will not be allowed to register.\n• Any student in good standing who is not enrolled for one single term will be allowed to re-enroll without applying for readmission to the Institute. This regulation makes no distinction among Fall Semester, Spring Semester, and Summer Session.\n• A student who is on academic warning or academic probation and who does not enroll for two terms may have a registration hold placed on their account.  If a hold is placed, the student will be notified and the hold must be cleared by their major school. For example, if a student is placed on academic probation at the end of the Fall Semester and fails to enroll by the close of the Registration Period for the Spring Semester, a registration hold may be set, and it must be cleared by the student's major school before they can register for any future academic term.\n• A student who has been dropped once for unsatisfactory scholarship usually will not be readmitted. A student who seeks an exception to this rule must have been out of the Institute for at least one term and have had a conference with the major school concerning the readmission. The Readmission Application Deadline for a student who has been dropped is two months prior to the published Readmission Application Deadline for the academic term.\n• A student who is dropped a second time for unsatisfactory scholarship will not be readmitted to the Institute.\n• A student who is on expulsion, defined as permanent separation from the Institute, is not eligible for readmission.\n• Students are readmitted under the current catalog that is in effect at the time of readmission. If a student wishes to follow the degree requirements from a catalog in effect prior to the term of readmission, she/he must make a request to the major school. There is no guarantee that such a request will be granted, and readmitted students should be prepared to follow the degree requirements as outlined in the current catalog. Programs of study that have been deactivated or terminated are not available for readmission. Students who were enrolled in a program of study that has since been deactivated are eligible for readmission to the Institute; however, they must select an active program at the time of readmission. Once a decision is made to no longer admit students to a program of study due to an impending deactivation or termination, readmission is also not allowed.\n• Any student, except a part-time graduate student, who withdraws during an academic term and wishes to return the following academic term must complete a Petition to the Faculty for consideration. This petition must be submitted to the Office of the Registrar before the deadline for the academic term for which readmission is requested. An exception to this is any undergraduate student who is enrolled for only one course during the Summer Term and withdraws. No petition to return will be required in this case.\n• Students may be eligible for academic renewal. See below for more information.\n\t\nUniversity System of Georgia undergraduate students who have been readmitted or reinstated after a period of absence of three (3) calendar years or longer are eligible for academic renewal.

This provision allows University System of Georgia degree-seeking students who earlier experienced academic difficulty to make a fresh start and have one final opportunity to earn an associate or bachelor's degree (BR Minutes, June, 1995, p. 7). The complete policy is available online at: https://www.usg.edu/academic_affairs_handbook/section2/C749/#p2.5.1_academic_renewal.\n• The application for academic renewal shall be considered as a petition to the Undergraduate Curriculum Committee.\n• Students may be eligible for an approved leave of absence. Interruption in enrollment due to circumstances outside the student’s control may qualify for an approved Leave of Absence. This may include, for example, required military service.\n• It should be noted that an approved Leave of Absence would be effective in a future term (see item 12 for more details). Students on an approved Leave of Absence would not have to apply for re-admission and would be able to retain their email accounts during the approved absence. Prior to returning, the student would have to notify the Registrar’s Office so that the record could be reactivated for re-entry.\n• The Leave of Absence would cover eligible students for at least three and no more than seven semesters (including Summer). If the seventh semester is a Spring term, students may opt to return in either the Summer or Fall term.\n• Students who are on an Approved Leave of Absence may not attend class, live in campus housing, or access other campus services.\n• The form to request an Approved Leave of Absence is on the Registrar’s Office website under the student tab, forms and student records.\n• The Leave of absence may be used more than once, but for no more than seven total semesters during the student’s enrollment at Tech.\n• Students who have been placed on academic drop or suspended or expelled for disciplinary reasons may not participate.\n• Students must clear up any other issues such as registration holds or providing any requested documentation prior to re-entry. The Approved Leave of Absence does not override other considerations or restrictions on enrollment.\n• Students should apply for the Leave of Absence as soon as possible. Applications for Leave of Absence will require review and signatures by the Office of the Dean of Students and the student’s major academic advisor.  Other signature approvals, such as the Office of International Education and Financial Aid may also need to be obtained.\n\t\nStudents should bear in mind the time limits as outlined in section 11 below in determining the anticipated date of return.\nReadmission is required when three or more consecutive terms have been missed (which includes Summer). Once the student has made the decision that they will have to or need to be out for three or more consecutive term and the student wishes to return to Tech without being readmitted, the application for a Leave of Absence should be filed with the Registrar's Office.\nThe clock begins when the student does not enroll for a third consecutive term. The Leave of Absence Request would have to be for the third consecutive missed term to avoid readmission.\n• Students should bear in mind the time limits as outlined in section 11 below in determining the anticipated date of return.\n• Readmission is required when three or more consecutive terms have been missed (which includes Summer). Once the student has made the decision that they will have to or need to be out for three or more consecutive term and the student wishes to return to Tech without being readmitted, the application for a Leave of Absence should be filed with the Registrar's Office.\n• The clock begins when the student does not enroll for a third consecutive term. The Leave of Absence Request would have to be for the third consecutive missed term to avoid readmission.\n• The Leave of Absence cannot be approved retroactively.\n• Students must file a Return from Leave of Absence form to return. If the leave exceeds the 7 semester time frame, the student must apply for readmission. The form is on the Registrar’s Office website under the student tab, forms and student records.\n• The Leave of Absence, if approved, would be effective in a future term. It will not be approved to be effective in the term in which application is made. It in no way supplants or replaces any other policy. If a student needs to withdraw from classes within a given term, they should follow the withdrawal process and if a Leave of Absence is needed or desired, it would be effective for a future term or terms only as approved.\n• Normally, students would not enroll in courses at another school while on Leave of Absence. However, students who wish to or need to take classes at another institution must obtain prior approval from the academic unit and from the Registrar to do so. Students who fail to obtain prior permission may forfeit their opportunity to transfer the credit back to Georgia Tech. In all cases, students on Leave of Absence should consult with their academic advisor for information pertaining to transfer-credit, the 36-hour rule, and other applicable rules and regulations.\n• Students should bear in mind the time limits as outlined in section 11 below in determining the anticipated date of return.\n• Readmission is required when three or more consecutive terms have been missed (which includes Summer). Once the student has made the decision that they will have to or need to be out for three or more consecutive term and the student wishes to return to Tech without being readmitted, the application for a Leave of Absence should be filed with the Registrar's Office.\n• The clock begins when the student does not enroll for a third consecutive term.

      "content": "[HEADING] Catalog\n[HEADING] Tuition Classification\n[HEADING] Classification of Students for Tuition Purposes\n[HEADING] Print Options\nUnder the Constitution and laws of Georgia, the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia was created to govern, control, and manage a system of public institutions providing quality higher education for the benefit of Georgia citizens. The state, in turn, receives substantial benefit from individuals who attend or have attended these institutions through their significant contributions to the civic, political, economic, and social advancement of the citizens of Georgia.\nBecause the overwhelming proportion of financial support for the operation of the public institutions of higher education in Georgia comes from the citizens through the payment of taxes, the determination of whether a student is classified as a resident or a nonresident of the state for tuition purposes becomes a significant matter. The tuition paid by in-state students covers only about one-fourth of the total cost of their education in the University System. Therefore, Georgia taxpayers are contributing three-fourths of the necessary funds to provide quality education for the citizens of the state.\nThe practice followed by state colleges and universities of assessing out-of-state students a higher tuition rate is a rational attempt by states to achieve a partial cost equalization between those who have and those who have not recently contributed to the state's economy, even though no precise way exists to determine the degree to which higher tuition charges equalize the cost of educating in-state and out-of-state students.\nCourts that have been faced with challenges to residency classification procedures have consistently recognized the right of public institutions of higher education to charge higher rates to out-of-state students and to adopt reasonable criteria for determining the establishment of in-state status.\nFor the purpose of these regulations, the question to be answered is not primarily whether a student is a resident or nonresident of Georgia, but whether the student should pay University System fees on an in-state basis. The term \"resident\" is confusing because it may have several definitions as it relates to voter registration, driver's licenses, automobile registration, deeds, contracts, wills, income taxes, and other matters. A student may be a resident of Georgia for some purposes, but not entitled to in-state status for tuition purposes.\nThe Board of Regents has adopted certain policies governing the classification of students as residents and nonresidents for tuition purposes in keeping with its responsibilities to the citizens of Georgia for an appropriate assessment of fees and reasonable share of the cost of their education. The taxpayers of Georgia are thereby assured that they are not assuming the financial burden of educating persons whose presence in the state is not intended to be permanent.\nWith these considerations in mind, the Board of Regents has adopted the following policies governing the classification of students for fee payment purposes:\nhttp://www.usg.edu/policymanual/section4/policy/4.3_student_residency/\nAn independent student who has established and maintained a domicile in the State of Georgia for a period of at least twelve consecutive months immediately preceding the first day of classes for the term shall be classified as \"in-state\" for tuition purposes.\nIt is presumed that no student shall have gained or acquired in-state classification while attending any postsecondary educational institution in this state without clear evidence of having established domicile in Georgia for purposes other than attending a postsecondary educational institution in this state.\nA dependent student shall be classified as \"in-state\" for tuition purposes if either:\nthe dependent student's parent has established and maintained domicile in the State of Georgia for at least twelve consecutive months immediately preceding the first day of classes for the term and the student has graduated from a Georgia high school or\nthe dependent student's parent has established and maintained domicile in the State of Georgia for at least twelve consecutive months immediately preceding the first day of classes for the term and the parent claimed the student as a dependent on the parent's most recent federal income tax return.\nA dependent student shall be classified as \"in-state\" for tuition purposes if a U.S. court-appointed legal guardian has established and maintained domicile in the State of Georgia for at least twelve consecutive months immediately preceding the first day of classes for the term, provided that appointment was not made to avoid payment of out-of-state tuition and the U.S. court-appointed legal guardian can provide clear evidence of having established and maintained domicile in the State of Georgia for a period of at least twelve consecutive months immediately preceding the first day of classes for the term.\nIf an independent student classified as \"in-state\" relocates temporarily but returns to the State of Georgia within 12 months, the student shall be entitled to retain in-state tuition classification.\nIf the parent or U.S. court-appointed legal guardian of a dependent student currently classified as \"in-state\" for tuition purposes establishes domicile outside of Georgia after having established and maintained domicile in the State of Georgia, the student may retain in-state tuition classification as long as the student remains continuously enrolled in a public postsecondary educational institution in the state, regardless of the domicile of the parent or U.S. court-appointed legal guardian.\nNoncitizens initially shall not be classified as \"in-state\" for tuition purposes unless there is evidence to warrant consideration of in-state classification. Lawful permanent residents, refugees, asylees, or other eligible noncitizens as defined by federal Title IV regulations may be extended the same consideration as citizens of the United States in determining whether they qualify for in-state classification. International students who reside in the United States under nonimmigrant status conditioned at least in part upon intent not to abandon a foreign domicile are not eligible for in-state classification.\nThis site uses cookies.

      "content": "[HEADING] Catalog\n[HEADING] Thesis and Dissertation Policy\n[HEADING] Print Options\nPOLICY ON THE ADVISEMENT OF GRADUATE STUDENT RESEARCH AND THE APPOINTMENT OF\nTHESIS ADVISORY COMMITTEES\nDoctoral Theses\nThere are two committees that function to advise, approve, and conduct the final doctoral oral examination of the thesis and the student's knowledge of the field in which it lies.\nThe first committee is called the Thesis Advisory Committee or the Thesis Reading Committee and consists of at least three people, one of whom is the Thesis Advisor. This committee approves the research topic, provides advice and guidance during the research, and is charged with approving the thesis when the research is completed and presented as the doctoral thesis. When the Thesis Advisory Committee considers the thesis to be satisfactory, a recommendation is made to the Vice Provost for Graduate and Postdoctoral Education for the appointment of the second committee, which is called the Final Doctoral Examination Committee, and it consists of at least five individuals.\nThe Thesis Advisory Committee consists of at least three members satisfying the following: (1) the thesis advisor shall be a member of the Graduate Thesis Faculty (which is defined below). If the thesis advisor is an Adjunct Faculty or part-time faculty member, then there must be a co-advisor who is a full-time member of the Graduate Thesis Faculty. (2) the majority of committee members shall be members of the Graduate Thesis Faculty. The Committee is approved by the Graduate Curriculum Committee or its equivalent in the academic program, recommended by the School Chair or the faculty director of graduate studies in the program, and appointed by the Vice Provost for Graduate and Postdoctoral Education.\nThe Final Doctoral Examination Committee consists of at least five persons including at least three members of the Graduate Thesis Faculty. This committee always contains the Thesis Advisory Committee members and others as appropriate, who are recommended by the school or college to the Vice Provost for Graduate and Postdoctoral Education for approval. The thesis advisor will serve as the chair of the Final Doctoral Examination Committee. At least one member of the Final Doctoral Examination Committee must be external to the unit in which the student is enrolled. A committee member is eligible to be the “external” member if they have a terminal degree and either 1) are a faculty member from a unit that is distinct from the unit in which the student is enrolled, or 2) are not employed by Georgia Tech and are active in research related to the topic of the dissertation.\nIt is recognized that some Schools and Colleges may wish to appoint a Thesis Advisory Committee that consists of five or more persons, and to recommend this committee to serve as the Final Doctoral Examination Committee. Where the constraints outlined above are met for both committees, this is permissible.\nMaster's Theses\nFor Master's Thesis advisement, the Thesis Advisory Committee consists of at least three members, the majority of whom must be members of the Graduate Thesis Faculty. The thesis advisor who serves as the Chair of the Thesis Advisory Committee must be a member of the Graduate Thesis Faculty. If the thesis advisor is an Adjunct Faculty or part-time faculty, then there must be a co-advisor who is a full-time member of the Graduate Thesis Faculty. The committee is recommended by the School Chair or the faculty director of graduate studies in the program and appointed by the Vice Provost for Graduate and Postdoctoral Education.\nGraduate Thesis Faculty\nThe Graduate Thesis Faculty of an academic program consist of the tenure-track faculty in the program plus any additional faculty (emeritus, academic, research and adjunct) who have been approved to serve as primary thesis advisors by the Graduate Curriculum Committee or equivalent governing faculty committee of that academic program based on the following primary qualifications and any additional criteria established by that academic program faculty:\nIn the case of interdisciplinary programs, the governing faculty committee for that program may choose to include both the Graduate Thesis Faculty of a student’s home school and the Graduate Thesis Faculty of the academic program when determining the membership of thesis committees.\nThe Office of Graduate Education will maintain the list of non-tenure track faculty approved to be Graduate Thesis Faculty, as provided to them by the academic units. The Office of Faculty Affairs maintains the list of tenure-track faculty; together these two lists comprise the Graduate Thesis Faculty. This Graduate Thesis Faculty designation is meant for the purposes of this policy only and is not a faculty rank. The designation alone does not carry with it any employment implications or rights as outlined by Georgia Tech Faculty governance.\nNote On Joint Degrees and Departments\nFor joint (inter-institutional) departments or degree programs, committees should have at least one faculty member from each institution, and a majority should be joint program faculty. Joint program faculty will have undergone a nomination and appointment process in the joint program to qualify for the right to advise students in the joint program.\nPOLICY ON PUBLICATION OF THESES\nA policy of the Georgia Institute of Technology is that Doctoral and Master's Theses are openly published. Extraordinary delays are not to be allowed to protect the proprietary interests of sponsors.\nIt is anticipated that all Ph.D. theses and a significant fraction of master's theses be published in the open, refereed literature.\nIn all cases, doctoral research should meet the \"Guidelines for Ph.D. Dissertation Research\", and in no situation should these be compromised to allow for concealing important research results because of security classification or a sponsor's proprietary interest.\nStudents may routinely elect to have publication of their theses withheld for a period of one year, if recommended by the student's thesis advisor. Requests for extensions beyond one year must be justified and approved by the Vice Provost for Graduate and Postdoctoral Education.\nA Georgia Tech doctoral dissertation in its final form may not be used or have been used to meet the requirements for a separate degree at another institution.\nGUIDELINES FOR PH.D. DISSERTATION RESEARCH\nThis site uses cookies. Review the Privacy & Legal Notice.

The research must demonstrate creativity. Dissertations based on well-known principles, techniques, and models applied to situations only somewhat different from previous applications are not acceptable.\n• The dissertation should contain clear statements about (a) the relevance and importance of the problem and (b) the significance, originality, and generality of the research results. The relationship of the research to the literature of the field should be described.\n• The research should possess the major characteristics of the scientific method, namely objectivity and reproducibility. Assumptions should be clearly stated in both experimental and theoretical research.\n• The dissertation should reflect a level of competence indicative of significant achievement beyond the master's level. Thus, the research is expected to draw directly upon advanced learning in the student's major field and demonstrate mastery of that knowledge.\n• The dissertation must demonstrate understanding of the theory and methodology related to its main thrust. Further the dissertation should reflect knowledge of the application area.\n• The research should result in at least one paper or creative work that is publishable through an external peer review process for the public.\n• The dissertation should demonstrate a high degree of proficiency in written communication of research results. It should conform to the Institute's requirements as outlined in the Office of Graduate Studies and Research \"Manual for the Preparation of Graduate Dissertations and Thesis\".\n• Send Page to Printer\nPrint this page.\n• Download Page (PDF)The PDF will include all information unique to this page.",

Recognizing that some master’s degree programs do not have a unique undergraduate counterpart program and that some master’s programs are offered by several schools, the term “discipline” in the prior sentence will be broadly interpreted in such cases. To qualify for this option, students must complete the undergraduate degree with a cumulative GPA of 3.5 or higher and complete the master’s degree within a two-year period from the award date of the bachelor’s degree.\nWhile students may enroll in a master's degree program upon admission with either full or conditional standing, all conditions must be met and the student's status changed to \"full\" in order to graduate with a master's degree. Students enrolled in a master's degree program must register for at least one semester per year in order for the original requirements for their degree to remain unchanged. In other cases, the school may reevaluate the student's credentials and impose additional degree requirements.\nStudents who have completed all coursework and are planning to submit a thesis in partial fulfillment of the requirements for a master's degree should register for research hours (MAJR 7000) consistent with a realistic appraisal of the amount of remaining thesis work and required faculty involvement. Students are not eligible to receive thesis guidance during any term for which they are not registered.\nStudents must normally enroll for a minimum of three hours each semester. Thesis students may enroll for one hour of thesis only in the semester of graduation; this option may be used only once. The Institute has no residency requirements for the master's degree.\nIf a student has completed all degree requirements and will no longer require any of the Institute's facilities or faculty time, the student may request an enrollment waiver, available on the Forms website.\nThe student, in consultation with the faculty advisor, should prepare a program of study for the master's degree as a guide for planning an academic schedule. In some cases, the student's school may require that the proposed program be submitted to the chair of that school for approval.\nThe program of study must be completed satisfactorily within six consecutive calendar years and must include, at a minimum, 30 approved credit hours distributed as follows:\nSome schools require more than the minimum credit hours. Refer to specific academic program descriptions for more detailed information.\nOther than thesis hours, the student may use only three hours under the pass/fail designation in the approved program of study.\nStudents who are pursuing two Master's degrees at Georgia Tech may double count a maximum of 6 hours of credit for both degrees. This ensures that each degree involves a minimum of 24 hours of coursework completed at Tech that is not double counted. Students should consult with their advisors on sharing coursework among Master's degrees.\nStudents may be eligible to utilize the Graduate Course Option or participate in an approved BS/MS program. Students should refer to the Catalog for requirements for the Graduate Course Option and for BS/MS program requirements.\nTo complete the requirements for the master's degree, the student must submit a master's thesis unless the school chair determines that additional coursework is of more importance in meeting approved objectives.\nStudents who meet the requirements for the master's degree by completing a combination of coursework and thesis must register for a minimum of six hours of thesis credit.\nA candidate whose program includes a thesis must present a treatise in which the results of an investigation directed by a member of the faculty of the Institute are set forth in a clear, articulate form. The purpose of the thesis is to further educational development by requiring the student to plan, conduct, and report an organized and systematic study of importance.\nResources for theses such as the Thesis and Dissertation Manual, deadlines, templates, checklists are found on the Thesis & Dissertation website.  The Manual for Graduate Theses specifies the formatting requirements for the thesis. Information regarding electronic thesis/dissertation submission can also be found on that resources website.\nFor a student to receive a master's degree from Georgia Tech, the following requirements should be met:\nThe student's school may require a reading knowledge of one appropriate language other than English.\nThis site uses cookies.

This can be done by completing the Online Application for Graduation.\n• The Approved Program of Study (which is listed on the petition for degree application) should show that course requirements for the master's degree will be satisfied before or during the final semester. The Approved Program of Study should be completed within a period of no more than six consecutive calendar years.\n• Students should have an overall GPA of at least 2.70 and satisfy all school academic requirements. (Some schools may require a higher overall GPA, and some programs may have different GPA requirements for certain segments of the program requirements, such as for core classes. If so, this must be reported to the Institute Graduate Curriculum Committee through the initial proposal or as a curriculum change and will be considered an informational item on the agenda.

These restrictions must be reported to the Institute Graduate Curriculum Committee as part of the initial proposal or as part of a curriculum change and will be enforced at graduation.)\n• Students should be registered for a minimum of three credit hours at all times. However, thesis students are permitted to enroll for one hour of MAJR 7000 in the semester of graduation. This reduction may be used only once. Students who have met all requirements for graduation before the last day of registration for the graduation term and who were registered the preceding semester may be eligible for a waiver of enrollment.\n• Coursework at the 1000 or 2000 level may not be used for a master's degree. In most cases, coursework at the 3000 level may not be used for a master's degree. But individual programs may allow a reasonable number of 3000-level courses in special circumstances, such as in a program that requires language proficiency. Individual programs may include 4000-level coursework, but this must be reported to the Institute Graduate Curriculum Committee as either part of the initial proposal or clearly stated when revising a program. These rules will be enforced at graduation.\n• Students should have completed satisfactorily any language requirement imposed by the major school.\n• Thesis students must complete the requirements for training in Responsible Conduct for Research (RCR).\n• Students should have passed any qualifying or comprehensive examinations required by their school.\n• Students should have completed any required coursework outlined at the time of matriculation.\n• Students should ensure that all requirements for the degree are completed and certified by the Office of the Registrar no later than 48 hours after final grades for the term are due.

After adequate preparation, the candidate must successfully complete both comprehensive examinations in their academic field and a searching and authoritative investigation of a special area in the chosen field, culminating in a written dissertation. The program of study for each doctoral degree program must include, at a minimum, 30 approved credit hours.\nDoctoral students customarily apply for degree candidacy after completing at least three semesters of coursework beyond the bachelor's degree.\nUpon satisfactory completion of these requirements, the Office of Graduate Education will formally admit the applicant to candidacy for the degree on behalf of the Vice Provost for Graduate Education and Faculty Development.\nThe comprehensive examination assesses both general knowledge of the degree area and specialized knowledge of the student's chosen research field. Each program is responsible for scheduling comprehensive examinations at least once a year and for providing students information regarding exam formats, rules, and scope. Exam retakes are to occur no later than the end of the student’s second full term (Fall, Spring, or Summer) in residence following the failed attempt.\nBefore a student becomes a candidate, they should present a formal statement for the approval of the school chair or college dean and Graduate Education that outlines the student's dissertation advisor, the topic selected for investigation, the objectives, and the steps by which the student proposes to achieve them. (Note that individual programs may have additional requirements for approving the dissertation prospectus or proposal before approval by the chair/dean and Graduate Education.) The dissertation topic must give promise of being either a genuine addition to the fundamental knowledge of the field or a new and better interpretation of facts already known.\nStudents must complete all degree requirements within seven years from the end of the term in which they pass the comprehensive examination.\nThe dissertation must demonstrate that the candidate possesses powers of original thought, talent for research, and ability to organize and present findings. Resources such as the Thesis and Dissertation Manual, deadlines, checklist, and templates are found in the Thesis & Dissertation website. Dissertations must be submitted electronically via the Electronic Thesis and Dissertation link available on that resource site.\nThe format of the dissertation (in general appearance) must meet the criteria published in the Thesis and Dissertation Manual. For other format or style questions, students should refer to style manuals appropriate to their disciplines.\nIf the dissertation advisory committee finds the dissertation satisfactory, it schedules the candidate for an oral examination on the subject matter of the dissertation and the field in which it lies. An examining committee approved by Graduate Education on behalf of the Vice Provost for Graduate and Postdoctoral Education will conduct the examination. The candidate's academic unit should forward the announcement of the oral examination, including the names of the examining committee members, to Graduate Education at least 10 working days prior to the exam.\nIf a candidate should fail to pass the final oral examination, the examining committee may recommend permission for one additional examination. In the case of failure, the Registrar does not receive a report of the examination results.\nIn addition to an adequate knowledge of the major field of intended research, the student must demonstrate mastery of another smaller body of knowledge—the minor field—preferably outside the student's school. The purpose of the minor is to encourage a wider interest on the part of the student and can include topics that will help them in their research or those that will allow them to explore and prepare for their future careers.\nThe minor will normally consist of at least six semester hours of work in related courses, selected by the student in consultation with a guidance committee and approved by the Graduate Education (on behalf of the Vice Provost for Graduate and Postdoctoral Education). These courses should be at the 6000 level or above, but the use of certain 4000 level courses may also be approved. The student must receive a letter grade of C or higher for a course to count towards the doctoral minor. (Courses that are taken as pass/fail are not eligible to count toward the doctoral minor). Courses taken at other institutions may be included in the minor. Once the student has satisfactorily completed the minor, the school chair will send a confirmation, accompanied by course grades, to Graduate Education for final approval and recording.\nAlthough the student need not complete the minor as a prerequisite to become a candidate, the minor must be completed and approved in order to be cleared for graduation.\nThe matriculation requirements for doctoral students are similar to those outlined for the master's degree with the addition of the residency requirement: doctoral students should spend at least one full-time semester in residence at Georgia Tech and should conduct research for their dissertation while in residence. Under special circumstances, candidates may receive permission to pursue their research in absentia, provided the chair of the appropriate school approves and a Georgia Tech faculty member directs the project. Although doctoral students working full-time on thesis research should normally be registered for a full course load of 9000-level dissertation hours each semester, this requirement is at the discretion of the advisor and the department. No minimum number of 9000-level dissertation hours is required for the doctoral degree. Doctoral students must be registered in the semester of graduation.\nIf a student has completed all degree requirements and will no longer require any of the Institute's facilities or faculty time, the student may request an enrollment waiver available on the Thesis & Dissertation Forms website.\nIn addition to the requirements listed elsewhere, the candidate is required to complete the following:\nIf both the dissertation and the examination are satisfactory, and the candidate has completed the requirements of residence, minor field, and any additional school requirements, Graduate Education will certify the candidate as qualified to receive the degree of Doctor of Philosophy.\nAll Georgia Tech doctoral students must complete Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) education, which includes an online training component and a doctoral-level RCR course. All master’s thesis students must also complete RCR education. For more information, see https://rcr.gatech.edu/academic-policies.\nThis site uses cookies. Review the Privacy & Legal Notice.

Both partners in this relationship must contribute for it to succeed. Successful advisor-advisee relationships enhance the careers of both partners. The relationship can take on three forms: advisor-advisee; supervisor-employee; and mentor-mentee. In the best cases, the three forms work together. This document articulates key contributions from each partner to an advisor-advisee relationship that leads to mutual benefit.\nThe Advisor\nAdvising graduate students in research-based programs is part of the job expectation for almost all Georgia Tech faculty members. Graduate students build the faculty member’s research record and reputation by contributing to the advisor’s research program. This situation carries an inherent tension. Although the faculty member’s success depends at least in part on the student’s success, the faculty member may also be responsible to outside sponsors, whose goals may not directly match those of the student. As an educator, the advisor must always protect the student’s interests as well as the sponsor’s and his or her own in the research relationship.\nThe Advisee\nThe student’s motivation is to earn a degree, which requires the acquisition of scholarly knowledge and research competence. Participation in the research process is an essential requirement for all Georgia Tech doctoral students and many master’s degree students. In this part of their education, the student’s duty is to put a best faith effort into his or her assigned contribution to the research process. At the same time, Graduate Research Assistants (GRAs) are also employees who help the advisor and research group meet the requirements of a contract or grant; while, Graduate Teaching Assistants (GTAs) and Graders are also employees of the school or program who help the school or program meet their educational requirements. As such they are employees with a set of job responsibilities that may not align with their research objectives or those of their advisors.

As an exception, the advisor and school chair may allow up to three hours out of the minimum 12 to be taken on an audit basis in fall and spring semesters; in summer semesters, the advisor and school chair may allow up to six hours out of the 12 minimum to be taken on an audit basis. (This exception is not applicable for students on immigrant visas or certain fellowships requiring them to enroll in at least 12 credit hours on a letter grade or Pass/Fail basis each academic term.) Hours in excess of the required 12 may be taken on any basis. Full-time students working exclusively on thesis research should be registered for 18 or more hours of 7000 or 9000 level courses (master's or doctoral thesis courses) in fall and spring semesters, and for up to 16 hours during summer semesters.\nThe maximum load for graduate students in good standing is 21 hours in fall/spring and 16 hours in summer. The minimum load is three hours, except for the semester of graduation. During the semester of graduation, a student is permitted to register for only one hour of master’s or doctoral thesis courses (7000 or 9000). This exception may be used only once for each degree.\nStudents with fellowships, graduate research or teaching assistantships, traineeships, tuition waivers, or student visas, and those assigned to the Institute by the armed forces for the purpose of pursuing a degree are required to enroll full time. Part-time doctoral students engaged in research for their Ph.D.s should meet the minimum enrollment requirement and register for the number of 9000 level hours consistent with the time they and their faculty advisors spend on the dissertation research.\nThis site uses cookies.

This committee reserves the right to change requirements for degrees as may be appropriate. Students enrolled at the time such changes appear in the Catalog have the privilege of following either the requirements stated in the Catalog effective the semester in which they enrolled or the requirements in the Catalog that records the change.\nThis catalog records the institute-wide policies and regulations that govern the graduate programs. Schools may make additional rules concerning their programs and the pursuit of their degrees, but such rules may not contradict Institute policies and regulations.\nA student may not apply for transfer credit until after matriculation at Georgia Tech. The courses to be transferred would typically be those appearing on the approved program of study form for the master's degree. A doctoral student normally does not request transfer credit. The rules relative to and the process for obtaining transfer of credit for graduate-level courses are as follows:\nIn general, Georgia Tech follows the Faculty Handbook and SACSOC guidelines to assign qualified instructors of record to graduate courses. These guidelines expect that an instructor possess an \"earned doctorate/terminal degree in the teaching discipline or a related discipline”. Georgia Tech further emphasizes the overall qualifications of the instructor even beyond earned degrees. While credentials earned within a teaching discipline may serve as standard qualifications for instructors of record, alternative qualifications, such as research expertise, professional experience, certifications, professional licensure, honors, awards, publications, or creative work may also be used to justify an instructor’s qualifications for a course. If alternative qualifications are used to approve an instructor of record for graduate-level courses, the rationale must be approved first by the academic unit offering the course, then at the Institute level.\nStudents who are pursuing two Master’s degrees at Georgia Tech may double count a maximum of 6 hours of credit for both degrees. This ensures that each degree involves a minimum of 24 hours of coursework completed at Tech that is not double counted.\nThe six-hour limit may be exceeded when specifically allowed as a component of an approved degree program.\nNo staff member beyond the rank of instructor in a school may work for a master's degree in that school. No new staff member with the rank of assistant professor in a school may work for a doctoral degree in that school.\nA student who wishes to withdraw their name from the rolls of degree candidates must formally withdraw the Online Application for Graduation before the end of the seventh week of the semester (or fourth week of the summer term). This privilege will be extended to a degree candidate only once.\nThis site uses cookies. Review the Privacy & Legal Notice.

This ensures completion of at least one-third of the courses for a degree in residence at Georgia Tech (applies to programs that are face-to-face and online format). A student in a master's degree program requiring 33 semester credit hours or more may receive up to nine hours of transfer credit for graduate-level courses taken at an institution accredited by a Canadian or U.S. regional accrediting board, or at a foreign school or university that has a signed partner agreement with Georgia Tech, and not used for credit toward another degree. This ensures completion of at least one-third of the courses for a degree in residence at Georgia Tech (applies to programs that are face-to-face and online format).The student must supply a current transcript for this evaluation.\n• To obtain transfer of credit, the student must complete the following procedure:\n\t\nThe student will confer with the graduate advisor to ascertain whether the courses to be transferred are a logical part of the student's graduate program;\nIf the courses are appropriate, the student will deliver to the school that teaches such courses a copy of the current transcript, necessary descriptive materials including catalog descriptions, and textbooks used for evaluation. The faculty of the appropriate school will determine the equivalent Georgia Tech course and the number of credit hours accepted. The faculty member who prepares the transfer credit form (i.e., the Non-Resident Credit Report) should have the school chair cosign it. The school should then send the form directly to the registrar with a copy of the student's Approved Program of Study attached;\nIf the student wishes to transfer more than the number of hours permitted in item one listed above, a petition must be submitted to the Institute Graduate Curriculum Committee that includes statements of possible justification for the granting of such a petition, transfer credit forms, and the recommendation of the student's school chair.\n• The student will confer with the graduate advisor to ascertain whether the courses to be transferred are a logical part of the student's graduate program;\n• If the courses are appropriate, the student will deliver to the school that teaches such courses a copy of the current transcript, necessary descriptive materials including catalog descriptions, and textbooks used for evaluation.

Graduate Minors are intended to broaden the student's education by encouraging and officially recognizing knowledge obtained by the student in fields other than their major program of study.\nGraduate Minors will be granted only to students who, in addition to the Graduate Minor requirements, have satisfied requirements for a graduate degree. The offering unit is responsible for verifying satisfaction of all Graduate Minor requirements, as well as completion of a graduate degree. Graduate Minors are recorded on the student's transcript but are not listed on the diploma.\nRelationship to the Minor Field of Study for Doctoral Programs\nThe Minor Field of study for doctoral programs is separate from the Graduate Minor. The Minor Field of Study for PhD students must still be certified by the program through submitting the paperwork to the Office of Graduate Education. The action to add a Graduate Minor and the action to report a Minor Field of study for the doctoral degree are two separate actions.\nThe Graduate Minor may be used to fulfill the Minor Field of Study for the doctoral program subject to approval by the major academic program of study. Specific information may be found in the Catalog here: https://catalog.gatech.edu/academics/graduate/doctoral-degree-info/#minor-field-of-study\nProgram of Study\nThe program of study for each Graduate Minor must satisfy the curricular requirements listed below. However, some Graduate Minors, with the approval of the Institute Graduate Curriculum Committee and the Academic Faculty Senate may be exempt from some of these requirements, may exceed some requirements, and/or add additional requirements. Consult the advisor for the Graduate Minor program for the specific requirements.\nA program of study for the minor is outlined, and it may include more than one option or \"track\".

These minors would be awarded at the same time as the graduate degree.\n• Courses used to complete one Graduate Minor may not be used for another Graduate Minor. There is no double-counting of credits between and among Graduate Minors.\n• Courses used to complete a Graduate Minor may be used to complete a Graduate Certificate (stand-alone or embedded).\n• Any course that is required by the graduate degree specifically by name/number or from a list of options to fulfill a degree requirement cannot also count towards a Graduate Minor. Courses that are considered electives outside of the major may count towards a Graduate Minor.\n• All courses counting toward the Graduate Minor must be taken on a letter-grade basis.\n• All courses used to satisfy the course requirements for a minor must be completed with a grade of C or better.\n• A graduate student should select a Graduate Minor in consultation with an advisor in their major field of study.\n• The graduate student should also consult with an advisor in the Graduate Minor field of study who can inform and advise the student about the specific requirements of the Graduate Minor.\n• Students can declare a Graduate Minor at any time. However, it is recommended that students declare the Graduate Minor as soon as they have made the decision so that they can monitor their progress using the online degree audit (DegreeWorks) and with their advisor. Declaration of the Graduate Minor also provides information to the relevant academic units that is helpful in planning courses.\n• The Graduate Minor is conferred at the same time the major degree is conferred. The MS or PhD degree and Graduate Minor will be recorded on the student's transcript. The Graduate Minor will not appear on the student's diploma. In the case of a Graduate Minor with tracks, each track will be created in Banner as a separate credential using the convention “Minor in ‘X’: ‘Y Track” where ‘X’ is the name of the Graduate Minor and ‘Y’ is the name of the Track.\n• Graduate Minors will not be conferred retroactively upon students who have graduated.\n• Graduate Minors may originate in several ways, such as:\n\t\nFrom a field in which Georgia Tech offers a degree program;\nFrom a multidisciplinary field, in which the subject matter is covered by multiple academic programs in multiple units;\n• From a field in which Georgia Tech offers a degree program;\n• From a multidisciplinary field, in which the subject matter is covered by multiple academic programs in multiple units;\n• All proposals for a Graduate Minor must include a statement of the educational objectives of the program and how the program of study is used to satisfy these objectives.\n• The academic unit(s) offering the Graduate Minor may choose to require an admission process, set admission standards, and/or set enrollment limits.\n• The academic units(s) offering the Graduate Minor may request the Institute Graduate Curriculum Committee to be exempted from some of the curricular requirements applied to the program of study or add additional requirements if this is justified as essential to meeting the stated educational objectives of the Graduate Minor. Any exceptions would require approval of the Institute Graduate Curriculum Committee and the Academic Faculty Senate.\n• All proposals for a Graduate Minor must include a plan for advising students pursuing the Graduate Minor and for approving a student's completion of the required program of study.\n• All proposals for a Graduate Minor must be endorsed by the appropriate School (Chair) or other unit offering the courses, College Dean(s), or unit head, and by the Vice Provost.\n• All Graduate Minors must be approved by the Institute Graduate Curriculum Committee and by the Academic Faculty Senate.\n• Information and relevant documents for proposing a new Graduate Minor can be found at: icc.gatech.edu.\n• A Graduate Minor generally will be available to all graduate students, subject to restrictions within their degree programs or admission or other restrictions as clearly justified in the Graduate Minor proposal.\n• From a field in which Georgia Tech offers a degree program;\n• From a multidisciplinary field, in which the subject matter is covered by multiple academic programs in multiple units;\n• Send Page to Printer\nPrint this page.\n• Download Page (PDF)The PDF will include all information unique to this page.",

Business students considering taking courses at other institutions should keep in mind Georgia Tech's 36-hour Residency Rule, which states that \"no student may be considered a candidate for a degree unless the final 36 credit hours required for the degree are earned in residence at Georgia Tech and approved by the major school.\"\nIn addition to its degree programs, the College of Business offers students in good standing an opportunity to broaden their areas of expertise or acquire skills or information beyond their major degree requirements. Students who satisfactorily complete this special program will receive a certificate of recognition. Certificates are only available to degree-seeking Georgia Tech undergraduates. Certificates are awarded upon graduation from a Georgia Tech undergraduate program. For certificate requirements, please see the College of Business Website: www.scheller.gatech.edu\nThe following certificate programs are available for undergraduate students:\nThis site uses cookies.

This applies to EIA, IAML, and INTA majors. This means that qualified students could complete the Master of Science in International Affairs with thirty-six additional credit hours rather than forty-two credit hours if completed within two years of earning a bachelor's degree.\nBS/MS International Affairs\nThe Sam Nunn School of International Affairs offers a BS/MS program for students enrolled in the International Affairs, International Affairs and Modern Language, or Economics and International Affairs undergraduate programs who demonstrate an interest in and ability for additional education beyond the BS degree.\nStudents in the BS/MS program will remain undergraduates until they meet requirements for the undergraduate degree, at which point they will receive their BS degree and be changed to graduate status. Students will be eligible to apply for the program after completion of 45 semester credit hours at Georgia Tech (i.e., at the end of their third semester), and if they show appropriate progress in their degree program thereafter. Any student in good standing in the BS INTA, BS IAML, or BS EIA program is eligible to apply to the program. Admissions decisions will be based on GPA and judgments of the faculty who have served as advisors or instructors. Continuation in the program will require the student to maintain a GPA of 3.5 or higher in Ivan Allen College courses. The program will not penalize students who opt out after the bachelor's degree. Students participating in this program will be eligible for the six-semester credit-hour Graduate Course Option, which allows students completing both the bachelor's and master's in the same discipline to use up to 6 credit hours of graduate-level coursework in the major discipline for both degrees.\nContact the BS/MS program director for further information.\nhttps://inta.gatech.edu/programs/graduate/five-year-bsms-inta\nThe Sam Nunn School, often in conjunction with other units of the Ivan Allen College, administers five certificate programs. These programs enable students to pursue a focused program of study in a specific area of regional/international specialization. The School awards the following certificates:\nA certificate is awarded upon successful completion of a predetermined 12 credit hour cluster of courses approved by the academic advisor or a specific faculty member. All courses must be taken on a letter-grade basis, and a C or better must be received in each course. Certificates will be granted only to students who, in addition to the Certificate program requirements, have satisfied requirements for an undergraduate degree.

The goal of the certificate program is to provide a basic but well-rounded introduction to public policy thinking to Georgia Tech graduate students. The program is designed to address the needs of scientists, engineers, management scholars and others who seek to be more aware of policy, regulatory, ethical, and societal implications of science, technology and innovation. The program will provide breadth and context for those entering employment in any sector. The courses in the program explore the processes through which policy is made.\nAlthough this certificate is not available to policy students, the courses are open to all graduate students, creating an opportunity for students to gain value from divergent perspectives. Students who complete this certificate are eligible to participate in the School's PRIME international graduate student exchange program.\nGraduate students from all programs may take the courses offered as part of this certificate. The certificate will be awarded by the School of Public Policy to any non-public policy graduate student who successfully complete the program requirements and earns a graduate degree from one of Georgia Tech's degree granting academic units. The requirements for the Graduate Certificate in Public Policy will typically satisfy the minor requirements for the Georgia Tech PhD degree.\nPlease contact Diana Hicks at dhicks@gatech.edu with any questions.\nStudents are required to earn at least a B in every course that counts toward the certificate. The credit requirements for the Certificate in Public Policy are 12 credit hours.\nThree electives are required for the certificate. These electives can be chosen from the list below or from graduate-level special topics offered by the public policy faculty with the agreement of the certificate advisor.

To have the credit entered on their records, students must submit the Modern Languages Proficiency Credit (Advanced Standing) form https://registrar.gatech.edu/info/advanced-standing to the School of Modern Languages for its approval, and pay $90 for each 3 or 4 hours of credit. No grade is attached to this credit, but the credit can fulfill the humanities requirement for graduation.\nStudents with credit for the DSD German language exam may receive the following credit: DSD I: GRMN 3XXX (3 hours); DSD II: GRMN 3XXX (6 hours). Students may not receive credit for both the DSD I and DSD II.\nOfficial scores should be sent to the Registrar's office for processing.\nThe School will not grant credit for high school study in a foreign language to students who have taken 1000 level courses in that language or the equivalent at Georgia Tech, or at other college-level institutions for which they have received transfer credit.\nUnder the Graduate Course Option, undergraduate students with a final grade-point average of 3.5 or higher may count six credit hours of their undergraduate credits toward a master's degree at Georgia Tech in the same field. This means that qualified IAML students could complete the Master of Science in International Affairs with thirty additional credit hours rather than 36 credit hours if they chose to further their study in International Affairs; likewise, qualified GEML students could complete the MS in Economics with thirty additional credit hours in ECON courses.\nFor information on Modern Languages course credits that may be counted toward the 6-credit Humanities requirement, see:\nFor students who first entered Georgia Tech on or after May 1, 2024: https://catalog.gatech.edu/academics/undergraduate/core-curriculum/humanities/\nFor students who first entered Georgia Tech before May 1, 2024: https://catalog.gatech.edu/archived-catalogs/\nThe School of Modern Languages offers minors in Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Korean, and Spanish as well as in Russian Studies. This program is designed for students who wish to develop their language skills to at least an intermediate level and to provide themselves with a greater depth than possible with a certificate program.\nStudents wishing to pursue one or more of these minors should declare the minor by filling out the minor change form with the Director of Undergraduate Studies in Modern Languages\nThe School of Modern Languages offers special summer immersion programs in China, France, Senegal, Germany, Japan, Korea, Russia, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, and Spain. These intensive programs in Languages for Business and Technology (LBAT) consist of six to eight weeks of study abroad in which classroom lessons in business, culture, and technology are combined with field work, cultural events, excursions, and visits to area businesses — all conducted in the target language. The LBAT experience offers a unique opportunity for rapid growth in proficiency, to build a deeper appreciation for the cultures and lifestyle patterns of other peoples, and to make lifelong social and professional contacts. Students will earn nine to fifteen credit hours (depending on the language program and the options available) at the 3000 level; in some programs, lower-division language courses are offered. These credits count toward a certificate, a minor, or the joint majors with International Affairs and Economics or ALIS degree. Program costs vary according to the country visited and the length of the program.\nIn collaboration with the Colleges of Engineering and Computing, the School of Modern Languages has initiated a Study Abroad and International Internship program that incorporates intensive applied language acquisition and cultural study. Students who participate in this program can expect to become versed in a foreign culture, fluent in a second language on professional and social levels, and gain advanced practical experience in their field. This program will prepare students for leadership positions in the global workforce in business, industry, and government.\nModern Languages works with international companies and with the Georgia Tech Center for Career Discovery and Development to establish internships and jobs abroad. Programs generally include one semester of study followed by a six month internship with a global company (some limitations as to language and field of study exist). The LBAT summer immersion course or equivalent is recommended, since students will need to take classes in the language spoken. HOPE scholarships and other financial aid apply. Additional language classes are available abroad. Students retain regular status at Georgia Tech by enrolling in FS 4000 during the semester of study and in INTN 3011, INTN 3015, INTN 3018, and in the Modern Language or Co-op International Internship (INTN 3011 or COOP 3011) during the internship. Students participating in this program are encouraged to contact their academic advisors, the International Division in the Center for Career Discovery and Development, the Office of International Education, and Modern Languages advisors. See www.modlangs.gatech.edu for more information.\nStudents who have never completed any course for high school or college credit in the language should begin in a 1001 course. Students with previous study in Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Russian, and Spanish should take the placement test found at www.modlangs.gatech.edu in order to determine their optimal beginning placement. Students interested in any of the other languages should consult with a language advisor for beginning placement. See www.modlangs.gatech.edu for more information.\nThe Linguistics Certificate consists of 12 credit hours.\nThree credit hours maximum; focus on the linguistic system(s) of selected languages; must be approved by Linguistics advisor\nTrack B: Language Processing is a joint collaboration between the School of Modern Languages and the College of Computing.

They round out a student's academic life, provide a challenge, foster confidence, and facilitate personal growth and development.\nCourses are offered during fall and spring semesters with 3 credit hours awarded for each freshman and sophomore course and four credit hours for each junior and senior course. Four hours of basic ROTC courses may be applied as elective credits toward degree requirements at the school. Courses normally meet two hours a week. A one-hour leadership laboratory and participation in physical conditioning training are also required for contracted cadets.\nStudents in the Basic Course do not incur military obligation unless they have received an ROTC scholarship. Scholarship cadets are required to participate in a field training exercise twice per school year. They are issued uniforms and may participate in other ROTC-related events and training, such as Airborne School, Air Assault School, and Northern Warfare Training.\nThe Basic Course consists of the following:\nThe Advanced Course is designed to fully develop a cadet's leadership and management potential, physical stamina, and self-confidence, as well as those Army values required of an Army officer. The objective is to produce the highest caliber junior officers fully capable of discharging a wide spectrum of command and management responsibilities in the modern Army and in the business world.\nThe Advanced Course consists of four semesters of instruction normally taken during the junior and senior years. Successful completion of the four courses fulfills the military science academic requirements for award of an officer's commission. Each student must also participate in a regular physical conditioning program and successfully pass the Army Physical Fitness Test. All Advanced Course students must participate in field training exercises twice a school year. twelve credit hours are earned, six of which may be applied as elective credits toward any degree at the Institute. Advanced Course students receive a subsistence allowance up to $500 a month. Service veterans and service academy cadets may qualify for direct entry into the Advanced Course. Certain Advanced Course students are eligible to participate in the Simultaneous Membership Program with the Army Reserve or Army National Guard. Students in this program affiliate with an Army unit as officer trainees.\nStudents enrolled in the Advanced Course are also required to complete a five-week Advanced Camp at Fort Lewis, Washington, to become eligible for commissioning. Attendance at Advanced Camp normally occurs during the summer between the junior and senior years. Students may also participate in additional voluntary training, such as Airborne School or Cadet Troop Leader Training. In addition to completing the military science academic requirements of both the Basic and Advanced Courses, the student must complete at least one undergraduate course from each of five designated fields of study:\nStudents who successfully complete the Army ROTC curriculum and earn a bachelor's degree can be commissioned as second lieutenants. Subsequent military service may be on active duty or with the Army Reserve or Army National Guard. The following courses constitute the Advanced Course:\nThis site uses cookies.

As an Air Force ROTC cadet, students are entitled to many benefits.\nThe Air Force ROTC In-College Scholarship Program (ICSP) is a highly competitive scholarship program aimed primarily at college freshmen and sophomores in ANY MAJOR. Detachment commanders nominate and rank/order cadets in their program using the 'whole-person' concept. All ICSP scholarships activate the following fall term.\nScholarships are available for any Clark Atlanta, Morehouse, or Spelman student. The objective of the HBCU scholarship program is to encourage outstanding HBCU students to enroll in the Air Force ROTC program. To compete for the scholarship, students must:\nDepending on the situation, HBCU scholarships can be activated in the same term.\nForeign Language Express scholarships provide preapproved scholarships to individuals in certain areas of study for which the United States Air Force projects a critical need in a few years. Scholarships in these areas are guaranteed if students meet all minimum requirements. Air Force ROTC provides an outstanding opportunity for students to receive a three-, or two-year scholarship. Depending on the situation, Foreign Language scholarships can be activated in the same term. In order to receive an Express Scholarship students must be in one of the areas of study: Arabic, Chinese, Persian-Iranian/Persian-Afghan, Hindi, Indonesian, Japanese, Pashtu, Russian, Turkish, Urdu/Punjabi, Azerbaijani, Bengali, Cambodian, Hausa, Kazakh, Kurdish, Malay, Serbo-Croatian, Swahili, Thai, Uighur, Uzbek, or Vietnamese.\nAir Force ROTC offers a variety of scholarships for nursing students that cover most tuition, books, and lab fees. The goal of the Nursing scholarships is to allow nursing students to complete their degree debt-free, while acquiring valuable resource knowledge about the Air Force and become part of the Air Force's medical staff. Air Force nurses may enter in any number of different nursing fields including clinical nurse, operating room nurse, flight nurse, or nurse anesthetist. Depending on the situation, Nursing scholarships can be activated in the same term.\nA Pre-Health Professions Program designation is offered to encourage students to earn commissions through Air Force ROTC and continue their education in medical or osteopathic school. You must apply before the end of the sophomore year. The Armed Forces Health Professions Scholarship Program provides up to four years of medical school and it covers tuition and fees, textbooks.

A formal application is not required. Students enrolled in the General Military Course (GMC) incur no military obligation unless they are on an Air Force ROTC scholarship. Those students desiring to become commissioned officers in the Air Force must compete for entry into the Professional Officer course (POC), which is normally the last two years of college. In the summer between the sophomore and junior years, cadets attend a four- or six-week field training session conducted at an Air Force base.\nField Training is, in most cases, a cadet's first exposure to a working Air Force environment. The program is designed to develop military leadership and discipline, and to provide Air Force officer orientation and motivation. At the same time, the Air Force evaluates each cadet's potential as an officer. Field training includes Air Force professional development orientation, marksmanship training, junior officer training, physical fitness, and survival training.\nCourses are offered during fall and spring semesters with two credit hours awarded for each freshman and sophomore course, and 3 credit hours for each junior and senior course. Four hours of basic ROTC courses may be applied as elective credits toward degree requirements at the school. Classes normally meet two hours a week. A one-hour leadership laboratory and participation in physical conditioning training are also required.\nStudents in the GMC do not incur military obligation unless they have received an ROTC scholarship.\nA survey course designed to introduce students to United States Air Force and Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps.\nThis course provides the students with a level of understanding for the general element and employment of air and space power.\nLeadership Laboratory is a separate course requiring two hours per week throughout the cadet's enrollment in Air Force ROTC. It involves a study of Air Force customs and courtesies, drill and ceremony, professional development opportunities in the Air Force, and the life and work of an Air Force junior officer. Students develop their leadership potential in a practical, supervised laboratory that may include field trips to Air Force installations and presentations by Air Force personnel. Physical Training (PT) is a key part of officer development. Cadets are expected to PT twice per week.\nCourses are offered during fall and spring semesters with 3 credit hours for each junior and senior course. Classes normally meet 3 hours a week.

There are several options in the Woodruff School for both mechanical engineering and nuclear and radiological engineering majors to do special problem courses or undergraduate research courses. Students can do a non-research special problem course. This is usually a design course and it might be combined with the capstone design class for a two-semester design problem. There are two types of undergraduate research courses; an ME or NRE class; and research internships, where students are paid for working on a project either part time or full time. For both options, the course appears on the transcript. In all cases, the student must find a faculty member to work with.

The strength of that foundation has resulted in enormous advances in the chemical, petroleum, and related industries that have relied on chemical engineering to provide much of the intellectual capital on which they depend. Over time, and with increasing speed, the discipline has expanded so that biological sciences and chemistry now fill the position once uniquely held by chemistry. Georgia Tech’s School of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering is a national leader in restructuring its curriculum and research initiatives to reflect that evolution.\nThe chemical and biomolecular engineering undergraduate curriculum leads to a Bachelor of Science in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. Chemical and biomolecular engineering principles are taught as the foundation of that degree but students also are expected to develop an ability to solve all kinds of problems, to view systems in their entirety, and to formulate and test solutions irrespective of the framework of the problem. Completion of the B.S. degree prepares students for entry into the workforce, for advanced study in chemical and biomolecular engineering, or for countless other graduate programs.\nThe mission of the School of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering is to provide students with the intellectual basis to be educated citizens, to prepare them for successful professional careers, and to advance the science and technology that form the basis of chemical and biomolecular engineering. In pursuit of this mission, the School has adopted the following program educational objectives.\nIn pursuit of its educational objectives, the School has adopted the following student outcomes. Upon graduation students are expected to be able to demonstrate:\nIn pursuit of these outcomes, the curriculum is designed to provide coverage of core areas of chemical and biomolecular engineering, and to allow students opportunities to explore the breadth of the discipline. The curriculum requires a total of 129 credit hours for the B.S. degree. The biotechnology option allows the student to focus intensely in this rapidly emerging area of chemical engineering. The standard option provides the flexibility to explore other areas of chemical engineering practice while providing an understanding of the biomolecular aspects of modern chemical engineering. The standard program will also allow chemical and biomolecular engineering students to tailor their educations to their particular interests and plans for their professional careers. Students are encouraged to use the required elective hours to earn a minor or certificate, or at least to focus their electives in an area of particular interest.\nMany graduates have found international experience obtained as a student to be valuable later in their careers; the School actively encourages such experiences and continues to develop new study abroad opportunities.\nFinally, although the focus of the curriculum is development of technical skills, it has elements geared to enhance communication, teamwork, and business skills.\nSpecial opportunities exist for students wishing to pursue minors or certificates in fields of particular interest. The School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering participates in the interdisciplinary Energy Systems minor and offers a Pulp & Paper certificate.\nGeneral information regarding minors at Georgia Tech can be found here: Minor Program of Study & Guidelines.\nDue to the sequence of courses and the order in which they must be taken, students who transfer into the school of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering (ChBE) from another university should expect to be enrolled for a minimum of six semesters (Fall, Spring, Summer). If, for financial aid purposes, insurance, etc., students are required to be full-time, they should transfer to Georgia Tech having sufficient non-chemical and biomolecular engineering courses remaining to enroll full-time for six terms. All prerequisites and co-requisites must be followed.\nThe B.S. in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering degree program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, www.abet.org.\nThis site uses cookies.

Students who would get both BS and MS in ISYE may use up to 6 credit hours of graduate-level course for both degrees. To take a graduate-level course for both degrees, the grade-point average must be 3.5 or higher.\nWhen faculty resources permit, the School offers honors versions of some of the required courses for the BS IE Students with a cumulative grade-point average of at least 3.3 are allowed to enroll in these courses and use them as replacements for the analogous course requirements in the curriculum.\nOccasionally, the School brings to campus selected individuals of unique accomplishment for course offerings built around their special areas of activity, thus making available a broader range of course materials than regularly provided. Prominent in this regard is the James C. Edenfield Executive-in-Residence program, which brings highly successful executives to the School. Participating much like visiting faculty, these executives bring to a classroom setting, both graduate and undergraduate, the benefit of their work experiences as they support the ISYE curriculum.\nThe Bachelor of Science in Industrial Engineering is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, www.abet.org.\nThis site uses cookies.

The purpose of bioengineering as a research discipline is\nInterdisciplinary graduate programs in Bioengineering are offered by the College of Computing in conjunction with the Bioengineering Center in the Office of Interdisciplinary Programs, the College of Engineering, and the College of Sciences. The student's home unit will be the College of Computing, which, upon completion of the student's requirements, will recommend the degree. This interdisciplinary approach has been approved by the faculty in the Schools of Aerospace Engineering, Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Materials Science and Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Polymer, Textile and Fiber Engineering, and by the deans of the Colleges of Computing, Engineering, and Sciences.\nThe program is for computer science or engineering graduates who wish to pursue a degree in bioengineering rather than in a traditional field of computing or engineering, or who have done bioengineering research in other disciplines. In addition, those interested students with non-engineering backgrounds (with degrees in such fields as physics, chemistry, biology, or mathematics) who meet the admission requirements will be admitted to the program. Applications from physicians with undergraduate degrees in engineering or the physical sciences will also be considered. All applications will be processed through the Bioengineering Center.\nAdditional information is available at www.bme.gatech.edu.\nThe Graduate Cooperative Education Program provides master’s and doctoral degree students majoring in any discipline at Georgia Tech the opportunity to supplement their graduate studies with specialized work experience.
