Edison Patent Award for Xin Zhang\n[HEADING] Rainin Funds for Researchers Developing Smart Probiotics\n[HEADING] Dean’s Catalyst Awards Announced for 2025\n[HEADING] Events\n[HEADING] MSE PhD Final Defense: Anton Resing\nThe materials of the next generation are taking shape here and you are the scientist who will oversee this shift forward. That is just what you will be prepared to do as you learn from an internationally recognized faculty, all while developing breakthrough materials and processes that impact everyday life. From applications of new materials to modifications of existing ones, the world demands your talents to shape metals, semiconductors and biopolymers. Materials is education, it's inspiration, and it's leading to a future that is waiting for you.\nMSE will have the great honor of hosting awesome speakers for our materials seminars next Fall.\nTo see a list of the individuals who will speak next semester please see the webpage below. It will be updated in the near future.\nBiomaterials | Electronic & Photonic Materials | Materials for Energy and Environment | Nanomaterials\nResearch areas span multiple departments and schools and colleges at BU, and are truly cross-cutting. MSE faculty demonstrate national and international leadership, attract significant research funding from federal and state governments, and are making a direct impact on industry.\nThe breakthrough was made possible through the use of phase-gradient metamaterials.\nBrown is one of the pioneers in the movement toward targeted design of new materials.\nMcDaniel seeks to replicate the pomelo fruit’s energy absorption mechanisms, on a larger scale.\n\"They exemplify each day the depth and excellence of Boston University’s talented academic community.”\nBoston University hosted the 2024 ASM Materials Experience, a hands-on event introducing high school students to the exciting world of…\nZhang is being recognized for her pioneering contributions to the field of metamaterials.\nProfessors Miguel Jimenez and Liang Hao are taking a new approach to IBD by building and testing genetic tools directly…\nThe awards aim to give an early boost to bold ideas in research.",
