Examples include providing carbon-free and renewable energy, clean water, advanced medical treatments and devices, and sustainable materials manufacturing. New materials are also required for continued economic growth in areas as diverse as aerospace, computing, and sensors.\nMaterials scientists and engineers at UW–Madison work toward solutions to these problems via research in a wide variety of areas.  Research areas include ceramics, computational material science; composites; corrosion; electrical, optical, magnetic materials; growth and synthesis; joining; materials for energy; metals; materials characterization and microscopy; nanomaterials; phase transformations; photonics; polymers and biomaterials; materials for nuclear energy; quantum computing; self-assembly; semiconductors; structural materials and mechanical properties; surfaces and interfaces; sustainability; thin films; and wear.\nMore broadly, the field of materials science and engineering is in the middle of a revolution in how we design and deploy new materials. The old way is by trial and error, which involves laboratory testing of hundreds or thousands of candidate materials, which is costly and can take decades to develop new materials and deploy them in practical technologies. The emerging new method leverages advances in computational materials science; materials databases, data science, and machine learning; and high throughput materials synthesis and characterization to achieve true design of materials. The goal is to develop and deploy new materials much more quickly and at a much lower cost than ever before. Materials design is a major theme of materials research on campus, organized around the areas of materials design via atomically controlled thin film systems, modular design of nanomaterials, and integrated experimental and computational materials engineering. Materials design and these themes cut across the research and application areas listed above.\nMaterials research extends across campus, well beyond the boundaries of the Department of Materials Science and Engineering, so graduate students in materials can pursue research with a large number of affiliate faculty. Faculty emphasize the cross-cutting, interdisciplinary nature of materials research, which is also reflected by the diverse undergraduate backgrounds of the student body, many of whom do not have undergraduate degrees in materials.\nMaterials research benefits from major campus facilities, including the Materials Science Center, the Wisconsin Microscopy and Characterization Center, Wisconsin Center for Applied Microelectronics, and the Soft Materials Laboratory. Research is supported by major centers, including the National Science Foundation Materials Research Science and Engineering Center and the Grainger Institute for Engineering.\nMaterials graduates from Wisconsin find long-term success in careers in private industry, national laboratories, and academia in the U.S. and around the world.\nStudents apply to the Master of Science in Materials Science and Engineering through one of the named options:\nThe Bursar’s Office provides information about tuition and fees associated with being a graduate student. Resources to help you afford graduate study might include assistantships, fellowships, traineeships, and financial aid. Further funding information is available from the Graduate School. Be sure to check with your program for individual policies and restrictions related to funding.\nPlease note that most funding is available for PhD students and there are limited resources for MS students. Financial assistance is not available for students enrolled in the named option in Materials Engineering.\nVarious types of financial assistance are available for graduate students, including research assistantships, teaching assistantships, fellowships, and special grants. Decisions regarding financial support are made on the basis of your graduate school application, and, for research assistantships, the matching of the interests or experience of the applicant to the research programs of individual faculty members.\nResearch assistantships (RAs) are available in any materials science area. These appointments are under the supervision of the major professor directing the research. Students interested in research assistantships in a particular area are encouraged to contact professors whose work is of special interest. The faculty’s research interests are given in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering faculty directory. An RA permits the most rapid progress toward a degree. Research assistantships in materials science graduate students are comparable to similar stipends from other institutions. Information about stipends can be obtained from the Associate Chair of Graduate Studies.\nTeaching assistantships involve teaching rather than research experience. They pay approximately the same as research assistantships. Teaching experience is especially desirable for students considering an academic career. The Department of Materials Science and Engineering supports a limited number of teaching assistantships.\nFellowships supporting graduate education are also offered on a competitive basis by organizations such as the National Science Foundation, the Hertz Foundation, UW-Madison Graduate School, the U.S. Department of Defense, and a number of industries and foundations. Because some of these fellowships have fall application deadlines, early application is necessary.\nReview the Graduate School minimum degree requirements and policies, in addition to the program requirements listed below.\nSelect a Named Option for courses required.\nA named option is a formally documented sub-major within an academic major program. Named options appear on the transcript with degree conferral. Students pursuing the Master of Science in Materials Science and Engineering must select one of the following named options:\nView as list View as grid\nStudents should refer to one of the named options for policy information:\nTake advantage of the Graduate School's professional development resources to build skills, thrive academically, and launch your career.\nThe Engineering Career Services staff offer assistance to students searching or preparing for internships, co-ops, and jobs with well-recognized organizations.\nThe Writing Center is a campus-wide organization that provides free of charge, face-to-face and online consultations for students writing papers, reports, resumes, and applications.\nDepartment of Materials Science and EngineeringCollege of Engineering608-262-3732msaedept@engr.wisc.eduDepartment of Materials Science and Engineering\nMS and PhD Programs, Admissions

Programs use their own internal processes to award assistantships to students.\nFellowships are grants that you do not have to pay back. Unlike graduate assistantships, fellowships generally involve no work obligations. There are both campus/departmental and external fellowships.\nTraineeships are supported by federal training grants from agencies like the NIH and NSF. Benefits typically include tuition/fee remission, stipend, and health insurance. To inquire about traineeships, check with your graduate program coordinator.\nThe Office of Student Financial Aid provides information and assistance to prospective, new, and enrolled graduate students about federal work study and student loans.\nThe UW–Madison Student Jobs Center has listings of open positions both on campus and off campus in Madison and the surrounding areas. Keep in mind that only 33% and higher graduate assistantships provide tuition remission for eligible students.*\nThis Graduate School competition includes awards for international and domestic travel for eligible UW–Madison graduate students who are traveling to present at a conference or conduct research supporting their dissertation, thesis, or final project.\n*Graduate students enrolled in service-based pricing programs, such as online and accelerated programs, are ineligible to receive tuition remission. Students should consult with their graduate programs and read their admission and appointment letters carefully to understand their benefits eligibility.\nU.S. citizenship is a requirement for some fellowships, but there are others for which international students are eligible, including University Fellowships and some departmental fellowships. Adequate financial resources are required for applicants.\nCost of attendance (COA) is an estimate of what it will cost to cover the expenses of attending UW–Madison. Your COA is more than just tuition and fees – it includes cost of housing, books, supplies, health insurance, and other living expenses. Although the actual cost of attending UW–Madison varies depending on your particular spending habits, the university bases your financial aid award on your COA.  Visit the Office of Student Financial Aid website to learn more.\nMost UW–Madison students are assessed segregated fees in addition to tuition. These fees fund the bus pass program, University Health Services, the Child Care Tuition Assistance Program, and other services, which are used at significant rates by graduate students.\nStudents with tuition remission are required to pay segregated fees. Fellowships paid through the Graduate School (not including Vilas travel awards) cover segregated fees in addition to tuition.\nSegregated fees are funds dedicated to supporting various student service programs and organizations. The student government on campus is responsible for the allocation of these funds. The Student Services Finance Committee (SSFC) of the Associated Students of Madison (ASM) submits budget recommendations to the ASM Student Council and the Chancellor as to how student fees should be spent.\nGraduate students with assistantship appointments of 33.3% or higher receive multiple benefits including a monthly stipend, remission* of both resident and non-resident tuition, and eligibility for health insurance with appointments of at least a full semester (for academic year positions) or six months (for annual positions). Students also build professional competency through assistantship experiences.\n*Graduate students enrolled in service-based pricing programs, such as online and accelerated programs, are ineligible to receive tuition remission. Students should consult with their graduate programs and read their admission and appointment letters carefully to understand their benefits eligibility. See a list of UW–Madison programs with service-based pricing (NetID login required).\nUW–Madison invests millions in support for graduate assistantships, including teaching assistantships, project assistantships, research assistantships, and lecturer student assistant appointments. Recent increases have placed UW–Madison’s minimum stipend levels for graduate assistants at or above the peer institution median.\nAt UW–Madison, admissions and funding decisions are made by the specific graduate program(s) to which you apply rather than by a centralized cross-campus process.  Because of the diversity of graduate programs available on campus, graduate programs differ in how they make admissions and funding decisions.  For example, some graduate programs only admit students if they can support them financially with assistantships, traineeships, or fellowships, while other graduate programs admit students without a funding offer.\nGraduate programs at UW–Madison also differ in the timing of their admissions and funding decisions.  Some graduate programs make admissions and funding decisions at the same time while other programs make admissions decisions first and funding decisions later.  As a result, you should always start your search for information about funding by contacting your intended program(s).  Program staff will be able to tell you how, when, and to what level funding is typically awarded to incoming students.  Likewise, if you have been admitted to a program, but have not received an offer of funding, you should contact the program to inquire about the timing of their funding decisions.\nYou may receive a funding offer from your graduate program.  A funding package is an offer of financial support put together by your program for a specified number of years.  A funding package may include a combination of different types of appointments (e.g.,  TA positions, program assistantships, or fellowships).\nThe terms and conditions of those appointments, including your stipend, may vary from year to year or from term to term. In addition, students enrolled in service-based pricing programs, such as online and accelerated programs, are ineligible for tuition remission.\nRemember that fellowships do not require you to work, but graduate assistantship and student hourly appointments do.  Therefore, it is very important that you take the time to understand the funding package you are offered.  The funding letter sent to you by the program should outline all the components of the package being offered.  For each appointment, you should ask for the following information:\nIf you have any questions about your funding package or about the information in your funding letter, contact your graduate program.\nFor questions related to how a graduate assistantship or fellowship appointment affects your financial aid offer, contact the Office of Student Financial Aid.\nPayroll taxes are assessed in identical circumstances for stipends provided to research assistants (RAs), project assistants (PAs), and teaching assistants (TAs) — i.e., income taxes are withheld, but FICA tax is not as long as the student is enrolled in at least a half time course of study. Trainee and fellow stipends are also taxable; however, tuition, fees, and books may be deducted before students calculate their tax liability. Find more information on the Office of Human Resources’ Pay webpage.\nFICA tax funds social security and Medicare programs. To be eligible for FICA exemption, non-dissertator graduate students must be enrolled at UW–Madison at least half time (4 credits during the spring and fall semesters), or 3 credits for dissertators.

The Center is committed to creating an accessible and inclusive educational experience for students, by partnering with students, faculty, and staff to design accessible environments and to provide academic accommodations so that students can engage, explore and participate in the Wisconsin Idea.\nThe Center works with UW-Madison students with physical, learning, hearing, vision, psychological, health and other disabilities substantially affecting a major life activity (e.g., walking, communicating, learning, seeing, breathing, reading, etc.). Many students have non-apparent disabilities such as depression, anxiety, autism spectrum, learning disabilities, AD/HD and health conditions such as Crohn’s disease or fibromyalgia.\nCommon accommodations include extended time and/or small group environment for exams, note taking support, sign language interpreting, real time and media captioning, and conversion of printed materials to accessible formats. McBurney Center staff members also collaborate with students and faculty to determine reasonable flexibility with regard to attendance, participation, and deadlines for conditions that fluctuate in severity over the course of enrollment. The Center makes referrals to other campus offices or community resources for non-classroom accommodations related to housing, transportation, personal care needs, and so on. Students should contact the Center upon admission to begin the eligibility for services process. Early notice is essential in order to have accommodations in place prior to the start of the semester.

Students are responsible for knowing current university regulations. University offices can provide current information about possible changes.\nStudents seeking to earn a bachelor’s degree from the University of Wisconsin–Madison will apply for admission through the Office of Admissions and Recruitment. Undergraduate admission is competitive and selective; professional admissions counselors review applications using a holistic process. We focus on academic excellence, reviewing high school and college coursework (when applicable), the courses students have chosen to take, the rigor and breadth of the curriculum, and how the student has performed in their coursework. We also consider written essays, letters of recommendation, extracurricular involvement, and optional test scores.\nOur review process is designed to help us identify students who are not only academically stellar but also have qualities such as leadership, concern for humanity, and achievement in the arts, athletics, and other areas. We also seek diversity in personal background and experience for potential contribution to the University of Wisconsin–Madison community.\nWe invite and encourage all students considering the University of Wisconsin–Madison to join us on campus for a visit. There are many options to explore and discover what UW–Madison has in store.\nTo submit an application for admission, review the application dates and deadlines, as well as the required application materials listed on our website.\nDeadlines\nFirst-Year Applicants\nTransfer Applicants\nReentry Applicants\nSecond Degree Applicants\nCompetitive first-year applicants have taken advantage of the rigor offered at their high schools and have performed well in challenging courses. Beyond academic excellence, we are looking for students who demonstrate leadership, community engagement, and passion.\nStudents are considered first-year applicants if they have not yet completed high school (secondary-level education); have not earned a GED/HSED (but will by the time they enroll at UW–Madison); or have not enrolled in a college or university in a degree-granting program since graduating high school or earning a GED/HSED. For more information about admission requirements and expectations of first-year applicants, please see our website.\nSuccessful transfer applicants will have a consistently high or upward grade trend; a strong cumulative grade point average; and rigorous coursework in English composition, college-level math, science, social science, humanities, literature, and foreign language. Admission to the university does not guarantee acceptance to an intended major, which is a separate process from undergraduate admission.\nStudents are considered transfer applicants if they have enrolled in an accredited college or university in a degree-granting program after graduating from high school or earning a GED/HSED. Students must have 24 transferable credits earned at a college or university after high school graduation to be eligible for admission as a transfer applicant. For more information about admission requirements and expectations of transfer applicants, please see our website.\nProspective transfer students can begin satisfying UW–Madison general education and degree requirements before transferring. Transfer credit is generally given for college-level courses taken at a degree-granting institution accredited by a CHEA-recognized organization. Courses must be similar in nature, level, and content to UW–Madison undergraduate courses and apply to a UW–Madison academic program. Students may wish to consult the UW–Madison Transfer Credit Policy for more details.\nA transfer articulation agreement defines accepted transfer courses/credits between two institutions, promoting the successful transfer of completed coursework into UW-Madison required coursework.\nUW-Madison currently participates in two transfer articulation agreements with the Wisconsin Technical College System.\nStudents previously registered at UW–Madison in an undergraduate degree program who wish to resume undergraduate study after an absence of a semester or more are considered reentry students. Reentry students must file an application for readmission but are not subject to the application fee.\nTo guarantee an early enrollment appointment time, reentry students should submit the complete application by March 1 for the summer or fall term or by November 1 for the spring term. In addition to submitting an application, reentry applicants must submit official transcripts for any work completed elsewhere since last enrolled at UW–Madison, a list of courses in progress (if applicable), and an academic action from the dean's office if they are in \"dropped\" or \"must obtain permission to continue\" status.\nStudents who previously completed a bachelor's degree at the University of Wisconsin-Madison or another institution and are interested in pursuing a second bachelor's degree are considered a second degree student.\nNot all programs are able to accept second degree students. Please be sure to review the school and college-specific requirements to determine if the program you are interested in accepts second degree applicants.\nAll second degree applicants will receive an initial eligibility review to determine if they are considered a second degree-seeking student based on official college transcripts or academic record (for UW-Madison students).\nFor more information about admission requirements and expectations of second degree applicants, please see our website.\nUndergraduate students visiting from other universities or recent UW–Madison graduates may desire to enroll at UW–Madison as nondegree University Special and Guest students. Contact the Division of Continuing Studies, Adult Career and Special Student Services.\n21 North Park Street\nMadison, WI 53715\n608-263-6960\nadvising@dcs.wisc.edu\nThis is a summary of the Placement by UW System or Departmental Test policy. Click here to view the official policy in its entirety in the UW-Madison Policy Library.\nEach student comes to UW–Madison with a unique set of skills and academic preparation. To assess where each student stands in beginning to meet their General Education Requirements, placement tests provide academic advisors with the tools to help determine in which courses students should enroll. Placement tests are required of all incoming first-year and some transfer students.  Transfer students may be exempt from placement testing based on their transfer credit. Other exams such as ACT, SAT, SAT II, TOEFL, Advanced Placement (AP), International Baccalaureate (IB), etc. do not satisfy the requirement of placement tests, however, scores on these exams may assist in appropriate course enrollment advising.\nUW System Placement tests are developed by faculty and instructional staff from various UW System campuses and led by Testing and Evaluation Services (T&E). T&E conducts studies to support the development of these tests and effectively uses the results to place incoming students into appropriate levels of English, math, Spanish, French and German. Outlined below are the situations typical for requiring placement tests.\nA first-year student with previous experience in French, German, or Spanish or a transfer student without transfer credit in the language who plans to enroll in one or more of these languages must take a placement test to qualify for enrollment in courses beyond the entry level language course. If you are interested in taking a course in another language, see the available Departmental Placement Exams below. Previous experience may include native speakers and those who have previous coursework in the language.\nNote: If your score is between 0-149 or 851-999, please consult the German advisor. These scores are not valid, and something was entered incorrectly on your record.\nNote: If your score is between 0-149 or 851-999, please consult the Spanish advisor. These scores are not valid, and something was entered incorrectly on your record.\nThis test is required for students admitted to undergraduate degree granting programs who is:\nIt is assumed that a transfer student with one of the direct equivalent MATH courses in progress at the time of admission will successfully complete the course, and will not be required to take the placement test. If the student does not complete or pass the course, the student may be required to take the placement test to demonstrate minimum math proficiency.\nFor more detailed information on math course sequencing and placement, please see the information available on the Math Department website. Students should discuss course selection based on math placement test scores with an advisor if they have any questions.\nThere are two tests used to determine the placement of a student into courses focused on the development of skills needed for success in college-level communications:\nThis test is required for a student admitted to undergraduate degree-granting programs who is (one of the following):\nNote: If your score is 0 or between 851-999, please consult your advisor.

All schools and colleges at UW-Madison use DARS to audit the progress of most undergraduate degree programs and certificates.\nDARS reports indicate which requirements are completed, which are complete with in-progress and planned courses, and which remain unsatisfied. For most undergraduate programs, DARS is the tool used to determine completion of the program and/or eligibility to graduate.\nStudents can request and review their DARS via the Course Search & Enroll app. They should contact their assigned advisor(s) for help reading and interpreting their DARS report.\nThe Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC) prepares students to become commissioned officers in the U.S. Air Force, Army, Navy, or Marines, as well as for civilian careers. Students may be enrolled in ROTC while pursuing a degree at UW–Madison. ROTC courses are open to all undergraduates who have met the prerequisites. The number of ROTC credits that count toward a UW–Madison degree can vary by department and school or college. Prospective and registered students should contact the military program offices listed in this section of the catalog for information about regular course offerings, summer camp programs, and scholarships.\nThe Air Force ROTC (AFROTC) program is the primary path available to enter the U.S. Air Force or U.S. Space Force as an officer. Students enroll in the AFROTC program while working toward a bachelor's degree in any major they choose. They attend an aerospace studies class each semester, a hands-on leadership laboratory, and weekly physical fitness sessions, while learning about how the Air Force and Space Force work and deciding which job fields match their interests. Upon graduating, they enter active duty service as second lieutenants, in leadership and management roles in the Air Force or Space Force.\nMost career fields have an active-duty commitment of four years after college. If students choose to separate from the Air Force or Space Force at that time, they can pursue other careers with experience and the distinction of \"military officer\" on their resumes.\nAFROTC is designed for students with three or more years remaining until graduation. To receive an officer's commission, AFROTC cadets must complete all necessary requirements for a degree as well as courses specified by the Air Force. Courses are often taken for academic credit as part of a student's electives. The amount of credit given toward a degree for AFROTC academic work is determined by the student's school or college, and major department.\nCadets must enroll in A F AERO 501  Leadership Laboratory I every Fall semester and A F AERO 502  Leadership Laboratory II every Spring semester, in addition to their lecture courses, for a total of 8 credit hours.\nQualified students may compete for Air Force ROTC scholarships ranging from two to three years in duration. High school students can apply for a four-year scholarship during their senior year of high school. Students must be enrolled and participating in Air Force ROTC to be eligible for scholarships.

It offers the opportunity to earn a commission as a Second Lieutenant for Active Duty, Army Reserve, or Army National Guard while pursuing an academic degree. It enables young men and women to prepare themselves to be leaders in the Army or the civilian career field of their choice. The traditional four-year Army ROTC Program is divided into a two-year Basic Course and a two-year Advanced Course. A non-contracted student enrolled in the Basic Course does not incur a military service obligation. All Military Science classes are taught in person on campus.\nThis instruction introduces the student to fundamental military and leadership subjects. It is normally taken over four successive semesters, but may be completed in as few as two semesters. Students should discuss available options with the Scholarship & Enrollment Officer before registering for courses if they have fewer than four semesters to complete the Basic Course.\nThe regular curriculum consists of a lecture and lab each semester. Freshmen are encouraged to take our class and lab with no military obligation. Students can enroll in a lecture without enrolling in the lab, but cannot enroll in a lab without the corresponding lecture. Labs are intended to provide practical leadership experience and military skills training such as map reading, land navigation, field training, and rifle marksmanship. Additionally, students who start in the Aerospace Studies or Naval Science programs can switch to Military Science and continue on toward graduation with no penalty.\nStudents who have completed the Basic Course or an equivalency (see Two-Year Program) and have passed all enrollment eligibility criteria continue on into the Advanced Course. This course consists of the following lectures, leadership labs, a separate military history course, physical fitness training sessions, and a four-week paid leadership capstone (Advance Camp) at Fort Knox, Ky. Students normally attend Advance Camp between their junior and senior years of Military Science. During labs and physical training sessions students are provided practical leadership opportunities to prepare them for Advance Camp and their future military careers. Students must complete all components of this course to earn a commission.\nCadets are to take and pass one history course that meets the ROTC Military History requirement for commissioning:\nStudents who are veterans, members of the Army National Guard/Army Reserve, or who have participated in the Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps Program in high school may qualify for direct entry into the Advanced Course. Students who did not complete the ROTC Basic Course (see above), to include graduate and doctoral students, but have two years of academic study remaining may be eligible to attend Basic Camp. This option compresses the Basic Course curriculum into a paid four-week summer leadership professional development course held at Fort Knox, KY prior to starting the Advanced Course. Students who believe they qualify for this program should consult with the Scholarship & Enrollment Officer for more information.\nQualified students may compete for Army ROTC scholarships ranging from two to three years in duration. High school students can apply for a four year scholarship during their senior year of high school. Students must be enrolled and participating in Army ROTC to be eligible for scholarships. Scholarships are merit based and pay full tuition & fees (both in and out-of-state) or room and board (capped at $6,000/semester) but not both, $600/semester for textbooks and laboratory expenses, and a tax fee subsistence stipend of $420 for each month of the regular school year. Interested students should consult with the Scholarship & Enrollment Officer for more detailed information concerning the scholarship eligibility requirements. For additional information about Army ROTC, students may contact Craig Giese in the Department of Military Science, 1910 Linden Drive, 608-262-3411, armyrotc@mailplus.wisc.edu.\nThe Naval ROTC Program was established to develop future officers mentally, morally and physically and to instill in them the highest ideals of duty, and loyalty, and with the core values of honor, courage and commitment in order to commission college graduates as Naval officers who possess a basic professional background, are motivated toward careers in the Naval service, and have a potential for future development in mind and character so as to assume the highest responsibilities of command, citizenship and government.\nThe purpose of the Naval ROTC Program is to educate and train qualified young men and women for service as commissioned officers in the Navy's unrestricted line, and the Marine Corps. As the largest single source of Navy and Marine Corps officers, the Naval ROTC Scholarship Program plays an important role in preparing mature young men and women for leadership and management positions in an increasingly technical Navy and Marine Corps.\nSelected applicants for the four-year Naval ROTC Scholarship Program are awarded scholarships through a highly competitive national selection process, and receive full tuition, books stipend, educational fees and other financial benefits. Upon graduation, midshipmen are commissioned as active duty officers in the Navy’s unrestricted line or the Marine Corps.\nThe four-year Naval ROTC Scholarship Program is available to qualified students who graduate from high school before August 1 of the year they intend to start college, and have earned less than 30 credit hours of college-level courses.\nStudents may affiliate with the Naval ROTC program, with the approval of the Professor of Naval Science, as College Program midshipmen, but receive none of the monetary benefits of scholarship students.  College program midshipmen may apply and compete for 3-, 2-, or 1-year NROTC scholarships in each of their freshman, sophomore and junior academic years.\nStudents selected for the Navy ROTC Scholarship Program make their own arrangements for college enrollment and room and board, and take the normal course load required by the college or university for degree completion.\nUpon graduation, midshipmen who complete all academic requirements in the Navy ROTC program are commissioned as an Ensign in the Navy or a 2nd Lieutenant in the Marine Corps and will be required to serve a minimum of five years of active military service. (Additional service requirements may apply for specific service assignments; e.g., pilot, nuclear power officer.)\nNavy Option\nMarine Option\nA significant portion of a midshipman's professional training during their four-year curriculum is received during summer training.\nNavy option midshipmen attend summer training, to include Career Orientation and Training for Midshipmen (CORTRAMID) for rising sophomores, and Fleet Exposure Cruises for rising juniors and seniors.\nMarine Corps option summer training includes Career Orientation and Training for Midshipmen (CORTRAMID) for rising sophomores, and Fleet Exposure Cruises for rising juniors. All rising senior Marine option midshipmen attend the 6-week Marine Corps Officer Candidates School in Quantico, VA.\nMidshipmen must ultimately make decisions as to which warfare area they will request to be commissioned into; CORTRAMID and the various summer training programs are designed to instill awareness of these areas and provide midshipmen with the background necessary to make informed decisions regarding their career choice. Midshipmen select their order of preference of available warfare communities and are ultimately assigned based on their class rank and the needs of the Navy and Marine Corps.\nAir Force ROTC—Aerospace Studies: Lieutenant Colonel Scott Gross, Professor of Aerospace Studies/Department Chair/Detachment Commander; Major Jeremy Ware, Assistant Professor of Aerospace Studies/Recruiting Officer; Major Ryan Hansen, Assistant Professor of Aerospace Studies/Education Officer; Captain Kaitlynn Williams, Assistant Professor of Aerospace Studies/Operations Flight Commander.\nMilitary Science—Army ROTC: Please refer to our website for current cadre and staff.\nNaval Science—Professor, CAPT Barnett; Associate Professor, CDR Mascotti; Assistant Professors LCDR Adam Stroik, LT Michael Breslin, and Marine 1st Lt.

Tied to the Wisconsin Idea and steeped in our long-standing institutional values—the commitment to the truth, shared participation in decision-making, and service to local and global communities—the Wisconsin Experience describes how students develop and integrate these core values across their educational experience.\nThrough the Wisconsin Experience, our students will engage in the following areas of intellectual and personal growth.\nEmpathy and Humility\nRelentless Curiosity\nIntellectual Confidence\nPurposeful Action\nStudent engagement and activism are deeply rooted in UW–Madison’s rich history of academic and research excellence. Occasionally, students are expected to help the university better understand and improve student learning by participating in evaluative activities, which include surveys, focus groups, and questionnaires, and by providing examples of their work through presentations, posters, demonstrations, and writing samples. We rely on the student perspective when assessing the effectiveness of academic and co-curricular programs. By participating, students help improve their own educational and related experiences and contribute to better educational experiences for future students.\nUW–Madison offers students many ways to enrich their academic program, regardless of the major field of study they choose to pursue. Engaging in research, studying abroad, being part of learning communities, participating in university honors, becoming a student leader, engaging in service learning—these are all vital components that enhance and strengthen classroom learning. This partnership between in- and out-of-classroom learning form the foundation of the Wisconsin Experience. The university encourages students to take advantage of opportunities to integrate their learning experiences.\nHonors programs, which vary slightly among the schools and colleges, are designed for students who wish to undertake work that is more intensive than regular coursework. High grade point averages are required to maintain honors student standing. Students should refer to Honors Programs for more information including specific school or college programs or to contact an honors advisor.\nOne of the most exciting things in life is to discover something new. UW–Madison provides unique opportunities to learn from and work with some of the world’s leading researchers and scholars. Options range from assisting with professors’ ongoing research to designing and directing one's own projects. For many examples, see Undergraduate Research Opportunities. The Undergraduate Research Scholars Program is one opportunity available in the first or second year of study. Students may cap off their undergraduate degree with a senior thesis or senior honors thesis and are encouraged to present their work at the Undergraduate Symposium. For program descriptions, see Undergraduate Symposium. For a sampling of the many grants and awards available to support and honor this work, visit the Undergraduate Academic Awards Office.\nUndergraduates have access to more than 100 community-based learning courses each year. These courses emphasize hands-on experiences that address real-world issues as a venue for educational growth. More information on community-based learning is available at the Morgridge Center for Public Service.\nUW–Madison's rich tradition of supporting learning communities means that the traditional classroom is not the only place where students learn. Students may choose to participate in any of the many residential and nonresidential learning communities, where students, faculty, and staff work together as both learners and teachers to pursue their academic interests. For more information about residential options, refer to University Housing's learning communities.\nAt WISCIENCE (the Wisconsin Institute for Science Education and Community Engagement), we advance inclusive education in STEM for all. Our high-impact courses, programs, events, and initiatives provide professional development opportunities in STEM in supportive learning environments on and beyond campus. We serve UW community members at all career stages—with many offerings for undergraduate students.\nIn WISCIENCE courses and programs, you can:\nStudying abroad extends the boundaries of the classroom to the world. It is an exciting way for students to complement and enhance their on-campus learning while earning meaningful credit toward the major and degree. Each year UW–Madison sends more than 2,500 students on study abroad programs around the globe, including international internships and domestic study away options within the United States.\nInternational Academic Programs (IAP) serves as the central study abroad office on campus, offering more than 300 programs in over 80 countries around the world. IAP program offerings, available to all majors for students at all levels, range from short-term faculty-led opportunities to intensive language study, internships, a semester or a year at a university abroad, service-learning, and programs with special themes. Students can visit the Study Abroad Resource Center, 301 Red Gym, to meet with advisors who can help students prepare and research study abroad options.\nAdditionally, in partnership with IAP, the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences, the College of Engineering, and the School of Business offer programs geared specifically for their academic disciplines. All approved UW–Madison programs share policies, procedures, and best practices, and are featured on the Program Search page.\nEmployers are increasingly looking for workers who not only have technical knowledge, but also “soft skills” such as critical thinking, problem solving, time management, and communication skills deemed necessary for success in a global workforce. Study abroad is one of the best ways students can acquire global skills and stand out to potential employers. Study abroad alumni have better job prospects. Based on a survey conducted by IES Abroad, 90 percent of study abroad alumni found their first job within six months of graduation. In addition to being able to experience new customs, cultures, interests, and food, alumni have reported that study abroad increased their confidence and had a lasting impact on their worldview.\nRegardless of major, students will find that study abroad has much to offer. The variety of program sites and durations (semester, spring break, summer, winter, year) allow students to select programs based on individual academic interests and personal goals and objectives.\nIn general, credits earned abroad can count toward fulfilling college and major requirements in any UW–Madison school or college. Seniors in most schools and colleges who complete their major and degree requirements while abroad on a UW–Madison program can graduate at the end of their study abroad program. Seniors who wish to graduate abroad should work closely with their academic advisors to ensure all degree requirements will be met.\nEach study program has its own eligibility requirements. Students are encouraged to talk with their academic advisors early in their academic careers about how study abroad can fit into their academic plans and future career goals. We are also working with departments to create Major Advising Pages to highlight programs that work best for students' degree plans.\nStudents who are thinking about studying abroad or have already decided to do so may be concerned about how they will fund the experience. We frequently hear from students that the program cost is a primary factor in deciding whether they are able to pursue studying abroad. Instead of tuition, students pay a program fee to cover the actual costs of the experience, which is unique to each program. Programs vary widely in cost, so it is likely that we have a program for every budget. Sometimes studying abroad is no more expensive than studying on campus, and other times the cost can be higher. We work with students to create funding plans for their time abroad.\nStudents who study abroad in UW–Madison-sponsored programs may be eligible to use federal financial aid toward the costs of the program. Students should meet with the UW–Madison Office of Student Financial Aid to discuss eligibility requirements. In addition, students can apply for scholarships specifically designated for use with study abroad programs. These include UW–Madison, national, and international scholarship opportunities. Students can also use most campus and academic department scholarships for UW–Madison-sponsored study abroad programs and should talk with their scholarship sponsor about that.\nStudy Abroad staff are committed to providing quality study abroad and domestic study away programs for every UW–Madison student. We work strategically to identify, address, and remove barriers that may prevent participation and to provide a welcoming and inclusive environment for students. Our team actively engages with students, faculty, and staff from diverse backgrounds and prioritizes the continuous development of our knowledge and cultural competence. We also recognize the importance of increasing access to study abroad for historically underrepresented student populations. We are committed to diversity and inclusion so that every student can engage with and understand their identity through a new lens and continue to develop and make progress on their personal, professional, and academic goals.\nThis is a summary of the Requirements for Undergraduate Degrees policy. Click here to view the official policy in its entirety in the UW-Madison Policy Library.\nThe University of Wisconsin-Madison sets minimum standards that must be met by all students pursuing an undergraduate degree.

Undergraduate Majors.\nDegree candidates are required to earn a minimum of 30 credits in residence at UW-Madison. \"In residence\" means on the UW–Madison campus with an undergraduate degree classification. “In residence” credit also includes UW-Madison courses offered in distance or online formats, as credits earned in UW-Madison Study Abroad/Study Away programs. Some schools and colleges may have additional requirements concerning courses taken in residence; students should refer to the specific school or college section of the Guide or consult with an advisor.\nThis is a summary of the Undergraduate Major Declaration policy. Click here to view the official policy in its entirety in the UW-Madison Policy Library.\nUndergraduate degrees at UW-Madison presume that students are completing a program of study that consists of a degree program that combines the requirements for the degree with focused study in a discipline, or that combines school or collegewide requirements with an undergraduate major in which they pursue focused study. All undergraduates are expected to have declared or to have been admitted to their focused area of study by the end of the semester in which they have accumulated 86 credits. Students who have not met this expectation may be prevented from enrolling in future terms until they meet with their advisor. Some schools and colleges have additional requirements governing when majors may be declared; students should refer to the specific school or college section of the Guide and consult with an advisor about declaring their major.\nUndergraduate students must maintain the minimum academic thresholds, including the minimum grade point average specified by the school, college, or academic program to remain in good academic standing. Students whose academic performance drops below these minimum thresholds will be placed on academic probation.\nThis is a summary of the General Education Requirements policy. Click here to view the official policy in its entirety in the UW-Madison Policy Library.\nAll undergraduate students at UW-Madison must complete the university-wide General Education Requirements, which are designed to convey the essential core of an undergraduate education. This core establishes a foundation for living a productive life, being a citizen of the world, appreciating aesthetic values, and engaging in lifelong learning in a continually changing world. These requirements provide for breadth across the humanities and arts, social studies, and natural sciences; competence in communication, critical thinking, and analytical skills necessary for success in college and beyond; and investigation of the issues raised by living in a culturally diverse society. This core is intended to provide students with intellectual and practical skills, basic knowledge of human cultures and the physical world, strategies for understanding these topics, and tools intended to contribute to their sense of personal and social responsibility. General Education complements the work students do in their majors and degrees. Together, these requirements help students learn what they need to know not just for making a living, but also for making a life.\nCompleting the General Education Requirements is an important part of achieving these competencies, and to do so, students choose from many courses in communication, ethnic studies, quantitative reasoning, and breadth of study across disciplines in the natural sciences, humanities, literature, and arts, and social and behavioral sciences.\nEach school and college may choose to allow General Education courses to count toward other degree and/or major requirements. Students should always check with their advisors to discuss any additional degree requirements and determine if students are required to take specific General Education courses or to complete the requirements in a particular order. Students should review their Degree Audit (DARS) report to see how they are progressing toward fulfilling the General Education requirements. Please refer to this website for more information about the requirements.\nThe university-wide General Education requirements are:\nAll students must complete 13–15 credits of coursework intended to provide a breadth of experience across the major modes of academic inquiry. This requirement encourages students to adopt a broad intellectual perspective, to examine the world through investigative, critical, and creative strategies practiced in the natural (computational, biological, and physical) sciences, social and behavioral sciences, as well as in the arts and humanities.\nStudents acquire critical and creative thinking skills as well as enhance their problem-solving skills through a breadth of study across the humanities and arts, social studies, computational, biological sciences and physical sciences. In courses satisfying the Breadth requirement, students will:\nTo achieve these outcomes, students are required to complete courses in the following areas.\nThis requirement challenges students to understand that there are many ways to research, understand, communicate about, and interpret creatively the world around us. These \"ways of knowing\" intersect and overlap, and the ideas presented in one area will often inform and transform what students know and how they think about the others. Students develop skills that help them make informed decisions in a wide range of political, economic, and social contexts, to think critically about the world, to better understand their own and others' experience, and to behave in socially responsible ways. (For more information about how this exposure to breadth of inquiry and expression enriches students’ undergraduate experience and complements intensive study in the major, please see the General Education Requirements website.)\nThe Communication requirement helps to ensure that all graduates of UW-Madison acquire essential communication and research-gathering skills necessary for success in university course work and beyond. Communication-A (Comm-A) and Communication-B (Comm-B) courses train students to gather and assess information from a variety of sources and to present different kinds of information, insight, and analysis to diverse audiences. These courses are essential for students' career success and their preparation for public life in a rapidly changing world. While Comm-A courses focus exclusively on essential communication skills, Comm-B courses provide content instruction in a specific discipline and teach research, writing, and communication skills in conjunction with the course content. Comm-B courses are offered by departments across campus and vary widely in topic, content, and format.\nStudents develop skills that enable them to be effective communicators in and out of the classroom. In courses satisfying the Communication requirement, students will:\nTo achieve these outcomes, students must complete the following Communication requirements:\n2–3 credits at first-year level dedicated to reading, listening, and discussion, with emphasis on writing. While most incoming freshmen are required to complete coursework to fulfill this requirement, students may be exempted from Part A by approved college course work while in high school, AP test scores, or placement testing. Students are expected to satisfy this requirement by the end of their first year of undergraduate study.\nLearning Outcomes\n2–3 credits of more advanced coursework for students who have completed or been exempted from Part A. Students should consult with the appropriate undergraduate advisor about when this requirement should be completed. Courses that satisfy this requirement are offered in many fields of study; although a wide variety of courses fulfill this requirement, students are encouraged to select a course most in keeping with their interests or other requirements of their intended field(s) of study.\nLearning Outcomes\nPlease note: Because English is the language of instruction at UW–Madison, Communication A and B courses are taught in English, and student work in them is also completed in English.\nThe Ethnic Studies requirement is intended to increase understanding of the culture and contributions of persistently marginalized racial or ethnic groups in the United States, and to equip students to respond constructively to issues connected with our pluralistic society and global community. Because this increased understanding is expected to have a positive effect on campus climate, students are expected to complete this requirement within the first 60 credits of undergraduate study\nStudents draw connections between historical and present day circumstances and consider perceptions and cultural assumptions when examining questions and making decisions. In courses satisfying the Ethnic Studies requirement, students will:\nThe skills listed above apply to students' lives inside and outside the classroom, and by pursuing these objectives, students will further enhance their ability to participate in a multicultural society more effectively, respectfully, and meaningfully. Students complete this requirement by taking one course of at least 3 credits that is designated as an Ethnic Studies course.\nQuantitative Reasoning is the process of forming conclusions, judgments or inferences from quantitative information. The Quantitative Reasoning requirement at UW-Madison has two parts: Part A and B. Quantitative Reasoning A courses provide students with skills in mathematics, computer science, statistics or formal logic that are needed for dealing with quantitative information. The acquired skills are broad-based in order to have a positive impact on the readiness of students to take a Quantitative Reasoning B course in a variety of disciplines. Quantitative Reasoning B courses allow students to enhance their Quantitative Reasoning Proficiency in a more advanced setting, where they make significant use of quantitative tools in the context of other course material. To ensure timely completion of the undergraduate degree, students must demonstrate minimum math proficiency  before they can enroll in a Quantitative Reasoning Part A course. They  should complete Part A of the Quantitative Reasoning requirement by the end of their first year, and must complete Part A before they enroll in Part B.\nAn an introductory course in college-level mathematics, computer science, statistics, or formal logic that is intended to prepare students for more advanced work in a disciplinary context.\nQuantitative Reasoning Part A Requirement:\nCan be satisfied by approved college work while in high school, AP test scores, placement testing, or taking a 3-credit course at UW-Madison with a Quantitative Reasoning A designation.\nIn the disciplinary or interdisciplinary context of a course designed to build on the tools of college-level mathematics, computer science, statistics, or formal logic.\nQuantitative Reasoning Part B Requirement:\nCan be satisfied by taking a designated QR-B course of at least 3 credits in a variety of fields of study, which enhances students’ proficiency in this domain. Students are encouraged to select a course in keeping with their interests or to satisfy other requirements for their major or degree program.\nThe university offers hundreds of courses that meet the requirements described above. Students should consider their own interests and check with their advisor when deciding which courses to complete. Please note that many undergraduate programs of study have breadth requirements that go beyond these basic university-wide requirements.\nThe following language is used in the UW-Madison course listings to indicate how courses count toward satisfying the communication, quantitative reasoning, and ethnic studies portions of the General Education Requirements. Courses that satisfy these requirements are also tagged with a mortarboard (graduate cap) symbol. mortar board\nNote: Some Communication Part B courses carry Communication B credit only at the lecture or section level and/or only in certain semesters; these courses will be indicated in the Schedule of Classes.\nCourse descriptions also include information about whether courses meet General Education Humanities, Natural Science, or Social Studies Breadth Requirements. (Click on course numbers in the Guide to see this information.) Students should also be aware that each school and college may, at its own discretion, designate additional courses that satisfy these requirements. For this reason, students should consult their advisors to obtain information about how these requirements are implemented in the school or college in which they are enrolled.\nWhen students expect to graduate, they must indicate their intent by completing the graduation application available in the MyUW Student Center. It is the policy of UW-Madison that all work for the degree must be completed and all degree requirements satisfied before the degree can be conferred.\nWhen students have been certified as having completed all university general education, degree, and major requirements, the degree will be awarded. When the degree is awarded, a diploma will be issued, listing the degree earned, and the transcript updated to reflect the degree, major, and any other approved academic programs completed. Students who have holds on their records will not receive their diplomas, or be able to order transcripts, until the holds are cleared.\nStudents who wish to attend the spring or winter commencement ceremony must indicate their intent by completing the graduation application available via Student Center in MyUW by the posted deadline. Students may participate in the commencement ceremony, in which the chancellor and deans symbolically confer the degrees, even if all degree requirements have not been completed. Neither participation in the ceremony nor listing in the program conveys degree conferral. Students will not receive the diploma or transcript notation until all degree requirements are certified as complete by their respective school or college. Should a student’s graduation plans change, updates to the intended term of graduation must be indicated via the graduation application in the MyUW Student Center.\nThe Office of the Registrar is responsible for maintaining the academic records of students who attend the University of Wisconsin–Madison and for many services associated with these records, including enrollment and grading. The office is located at:\n333 East Campus Mall #11101\nMadison, WI 53715-1384\nregistrar@em.wisc.edu\n608-262-3811\nMany student services are available online in the Student Center on MyUW–Madison (MyUW), including viewing grades, ordering transcripts, and updating address and emergency contact information. Students are responsible for the accuracy of the addresses provided in MyUW and for the courses selected when they enroll.\nMyUW is available to eligible students, who gain access by using their Net ID and password from any device with internet access. For further information, see DoIT (Division of Information Technology).\nStudents enroll for courses, obtain information about deadlines, view their class schedule, and more in the Course Search & Enroll application on MyUW. Information about key deadlines and course enrollment are also available at the Office of the Registrar website. Additional assistance with the course enrollment process is available by calling 608-262-3811 or emailing registrar@em.wisc.edu.\nThe general quality of a student's work is expressed in terms of a grade point average (GPA). It is based on the total number of credits taken for which grades of A through F are received. Semester grades are reported by letter only; plus and minus signs are not authorized. The highest possible GPA is 4.0, representing A grades in every course; the lowest possible is 0.0. The following is the official scale of grades at UW–Madison.\nExcluded from the GPA calculation are:\nS or U (Satisfactory or Unsatisfactory) in courses taken on the pass/fail basis.\nSD/UD (Satisfactory-Disruption/University Disruption-No Credit): special grading option for students in response to the COVID-19 events.\nS/M/U (Satisfactory/Marginal/Unsatisfactory) in courses offered only through the School of Veterinary Medicine.\nCr or N (Credit or No Credit) in courses offered on a credit/no credit basis.\nDef (Deferred), Ex (Excused), PE (Permanently Excused), formerly used only for required Physical Education. The Physical Education requirement was discontinued effective August 30, 1976.\nDR (Dropped), indicates the course was dropped.\nI (IN for Cr/N Courses) (Incomplete), a temporary grade used when work is not completed during a term.\nEI (Extended Incomplete), a temporary grade for an extended time limit to remove an Incomplete.\nPI (Permanent Incomplete), a permanent grade replacing an Incomplete incurred in a student’s last semester in residence and not removed within five years.\nNR (No Report), indicates that a grade was not submitted by the instructor. Has no net effect on GPA. Effective Summer 1999.\nNW (No Work)…”should be used for students who enroll in a course and then never attend. ‘No Work’ in this context means that the instructor has no evidence that the student ever attended, in that no course work was ever submitted. Any student who does attend for part of the semester, and then stops participating should be given a grade of ‘F’ unless there are grounds for assignment of a grade of ‘I'(Incomplete).” Fac. Doc. 1028; effective 9/94.\nP (Progress), a temporary grade used for courses extending beyond one term. The final grade determines the grade for each term and replaces P grades for the course.\nQ (Question on Credits or Honors), a temporary grade used during grade reporting to indicate a credit problem. Should only be used when the student is enrolled for the wrong number of credits or their honors indication is incorrect. A Q grade may be represented on a grade report as “?”.\nR (Registered), not used after the Summer 1974.\nW (Withdrew), indicates the student withdrew from the University while enrolled in the course.\nAudited courses, denoted as such by ‘AU’ in place of a number of credits, are graded either S (Satisfactory) or NR (No Report).\nSome courses are designated as being offered on a Credit/No Credit basis. The transcript for the course will indicate either CR, meaning the student earned the credits for which the course was offered, or N, meaning that the student did not earn any credit even though enrolled for the course. Students may not take such courses on any other basis.\nThis policy concerns the use of the pass/fail grading option for degree-seeking undergraduate students. According to the UW–Madison grading scale, grades of S (satisfactory) and U (unsatisfactory) are the transcripted grades that are used for what is commonly known as pass/fail. It applies only to courses that use the default A–F grading scale and that also allow students to choose to take a course on a pass/fail (PF) basis.1\nThe instructor enters the letter grade earned by students on the grade roster, and those letter grades are subsequently recorded as a pass (S) or fail (U) on the student record. A pass (S) will be recorded when a letter grade of A through C is earned. A fail (U) will be recorded when a letter grade of D or F is earned. In addition to the S or U notation, the student transcript includes the symbol # for courses that were taken on a pass/fail basis. Neither the S nor the U is used in computing the grade point average. Instructors are not informed that a student has elected to take the course pass/fail.\nStudents must be in good academic standing according to their school/college in order to be eligible to request the pass/fail grading option.\nUndergraduates may carry one course on a pass/fail basis per term and a maximum of 16 credits during their undergrad career. The summer sessions collectively count as a single term.\nRequired courses cannot be taken on a pass/fail basis.  The student’s school or college may review the request to take a course pass/fail and reject requests for nonelective work. It may be difficult for the school or college official to determine whether a course is an elective or being used to fulfill a requirement since a student’s enrollment or the way a course is being used in the specific program of study may change. Ultimately it is the student’s responsibility to be sure that the requested course is an elective. Students are strongly advised to consult with an academic advisor before taking a course pass/fail. Courses taken on a pass/fail basis will not count for nonelective requirements even if they would normally count toward such requirements.\nEach school or college is responsible for clearly communicating to its students what the definition of “good academic standing” is and what a free elective is.\nIn each school or college, the office responsible for academic policy exceptions is authorized to make exceptions to the pass/fail policy.\nStudents indicate that they would like to have a course they are enrolled in graded on a pass/fail basis by completing a course change request via their Student Center (see Course Change Request for detailed information). Students may submit pass/fail requests via their Student Center from the time that they enroll until midnight on the Friday at the end of the fourth week of fall and spring semesters. (For modular and summer session courses, pass/fail requests must be submitted by midnight Friday of the week in which the session is one-fourth completed).\nThe deadline for requesting the pass/fail grading option is posted on the Office of the Registrar website. These deadlines are based on the idea that the pass/fail option is intended to encourage students to explore educational opportunities that they might otherwise not be willing to attempt. Pass/fail is not intended as a way for students to avoid academic consequences.\nOnce the student has submitted the request to take a course on a pass/fail basis the request is routed via Student Information System workflow to an academic dean in the school or college for approval or further communication with the student.  The school/college official must approve the request before the grading option is changed to pass/fail by the Office of the Registrar.\nStudents can see whether a course is being graded on a pass/fail basis in the MyUW Student Center's Academic Records > View Grades section.\n1 For study abroad programs operated by the College of Engineering, courses taken abroad toward an engineering major will be posted as pass/fail. This occurs automatically and is not a student option; this practice is not covered or affected by this policy.\nEvery course grade of F counts as 0 grade points and remains permanently on the transcript. If the course is repeated, the original F will remain on the transcript and will be included in computing the GPA.\nThis is a summary of the Undergraduate and Special (Nondegree) Student Lapsed Incomplete Grades policy. Click here to view the official policy in its entirety in the UW-Madison Policy Library.\nA grade of Incomplete may be assigned to a student who, because of illness or another unusual and substantiated cause beyond their control, is unable to complete the coursework.\nTo be eligible for an Incomplete grade, the student must:\nThe student must initiate the request for a grade of Incomplete with the instructor before the end of the term. The instructor and student must agree on the coursework to be completed and establish a plan for the work to be submitted by the student, and the instructor-assigned grade change to be entered in the student information system and updated on the student record prior to the deadlines below.\nIf the Incomplete grade is not changed to a final grade by the Friday of the eighth week deadline, the Incomplete grade will be changed (lapsed) to a grade of F or N (for Credit/No Credit courses).\nIf the outstanding work is unable to be completed by the deadline due to additional extenuating circumstances, the instructor may extend the time the student has to complete outstanding work by submitting a request to change the Incomplete grade to a grade of Extended Incomplete (EI).\nA graduating student with an Incomplete grade must complete all coursework before their degree can be awarded. The completion of coursework after the intended term/semester of graduation means that a student will be awarded their degree at the next official conferral date.\nStudents may audit eligible courses with instructor and academic dean consent if no laboratory or performance skills are involved. Auditors may not recite or take examinations but are expected to attend classes regularly and do some assigned work. Although courses for which students enroll as an auditor are factored into tuition, such courses do not earn academic credit and do not count in determining full-time/part-time load for enrollment certification in an academic term. Students initiate a request to audit by completing a course change request via Student Center (see Course Change Request for detailed information). Students may submit audit requests via Student Center from the time that they enroll until midnight on the Friday at the end of the fourth week of fall and spring semesters. (For modular and summer session courses, audit requests must be submitted by midnight Friday of the week in which the session is one-fourth completed). School and college policies may vary from this description. Students are advised to consult with the instructor concerning specific course requirements that must be satisfied.\nStudents are classified by year according to the number of credits they have earned:\nFreshman: fewer than 24 credits\nSophomore: 24-53 credits\nJunior: 54-85 credits\nSenior: 86 or more credits\nThe UW System Board of Regents sets tuition and fee rates annually. Rates are subject to change without notice.\nThe tuition and fee schedule is available on the Bursar's Office website. Students whose first enrollment for the term is after the first Friday of the official first week of classes are assessed a late initial enrollment fee. Exception: Special and Guest students have until the Friday of the second week of classes to enroll.\nEnrolled students can view account charges/payments, financial aid (loans, grants, scholarships) received, and refunds on their MyUW Student Center, Financial Account. Students can also access links to view and pay student account eBills, set up Authorized Payers for account access, and enroll for eRefund.\nThe Bursar’s Office provides the student account bill electronically (eBill). The eBill is published on the MyUW Student Center payment portal. Students and their Authorized Payers receive an email when the eBill is available to view.\nFor questions about tuition rates, student account activity and billing questions, contact the Bursar's Office.\ntuition@bussvc.wisc.edu (include student ID and name)\n608-262-3611\n333 East Campus Mall #10501\nMadison, WI 53715-1383\nStudent Account payment options include making an online ePayment, mailing a check to the Bursar's Office, or placing a check in the first-floor lobby dropbox. For detailed payment information, see Payment Methods on the Bursar's Office website.\nIf the balance is not paid by the due date, a late fee is assessed and a hold is placed to prevent future enrollment until the account is paid.\nAt the University of Wisconsin-Madison, residence for tuition determinations are governed by Wisconsin Statutes 36.27(2). The standards to qualify as a Wisconsin resident are unique to this law and may differ from standards used to determine residency for other purposes, such as voting, paying taxes, obtaining licensures, and other forms of residency. In general, eligibility for resident status requires that an independent student (or the student’s parent, if the student is a dependent) must demonstrate bona fide residency in Wisconsin for at least twelve months immediately prior to enrollment for any term. However, the law also states that individuals who come to Wisconsin primarily for educational purposes do not qualify as Wisconsin residents for tuition purposes, even if they meet the remaining eligibility criteria. As a result, students who begin their enrollment as nonresidents usually maintain nonresident status for the duration of their enrollment.\nWhile all individuals who do not demonstrate eligibility under Wisconsin Statutes 36.27(2) will be classified as nonresidents, the law does provide a limited set of exceptions to twelve-month period normally required to establish bona fide residency. These exceptions pertain to some (but not all) individuals who are refugees in Wisconsin, who have certain military or veteran statuses, or who have relocated to Wisconsin for full-time, permanent employment under certain conditions. If you have questions about whether your circumstances might align with the exemptions noted here, you may wish to contact a residence specialist to discuss your residency further.\nFor more information and the full text of Wisconsin Statutes, Section 36.27(2), see the Office of the Registrar website or contact a residence specialist at 608-262-1355 or ResidenceForTuition@registrar.wisc.edu.\nNonresident students who plan to use federal veteran benefits such as the post-9/11 GI Bill may be eligible for resident tuition rates even though they are formally classified as nonresidents of Wisconsin. If you plan to use veteran benefits while enrolled at UW-Madison, you may wish to speak with University Veterans Services at 608-265-4628 or veterans@wisc.edu for more information about how to use your military benefits at the University.\nMinnesota residents who are certified by the Minnesota Office of Higher Education for the appropriate term to attend UW–Madison under the Minnesota–Wisconsin Tuition Reciprocity Agreement will be assessed the approved reciprocity tuition rate, plus the segregated fees assessed to all UW–Madison students. Students under this program will be classified as nonresidents of Wisconsin. Minnesota residents must apply to the Minnesota Office of Higher Education for verification of their eligibility for reciprocity.\nTo learn more about eligibility, application procedures, and deadlines, visit the UW-Madison Minnesota Reciprocity website.

Courses can be updated three times per year, to coincide with the priority enrollment time period for upcoming terms.\nBelow you will find a short description of items included in course listings and course bubbles. For further information regarding course designations, consult your advisor or view the Requirements for Undergraduate Study. The mortarboard symbol ()  appears before the title of any course that fulfills one of the Communication Part A or Part B, Ethnic Studies, or Quantitative Reasoning Part A or Part B requirements.mortar board\nRequisites represent the academic preparation required to be successful in a course. They are enforced via the enrollment system, meaning a student who attempts to enroll in a course but lacks the requisite preparation will be prevented from enrolling in the course until the requisite has been met.\nIt is assumed that courses in progress at the time of enrollment will be completed successfully and thus fulfill a course requisite. Course administrators/departments may check the completion of these courses and may drop enrolled students who failed or dropped a requisite course and notify them accordingly.\nThere are occasions when a student may have the necessary preparation to be successful in a course, but this preparation is not easily identifiable in their student record. An example would be earned transfer credit that did not equate to a UW-Madison course that meets the spirit of the required course. You may ask the course instructor for permission to enroll in a course for which you do not meet the enforced requisite. Instructor permission will override any restrictions on enrollment the class might have.\nCourses identified in requisites list the subject(s) and catalog number (example: MATH 221). If a course is cross-listed, you will meet the requisite regardless of the subject you enrolled, with one exception (see minimum credits in a subject). For example, ZOOLOGY/​BIOLOGY  101 is the same course, so requisites recognize both Zoology and Biology as fulfilling the requirement; it does not matter which course you enrolled in.\nConcurrent enrollment means being enrolled in a course in the same term as the requisite course. There are three ways these can be written:\nRequisites may specify a certain number of credits in any given subject (example: 3 credits in HISTORY). This means you must have taken at least 3 credits in the HISTORY course array without specifying an individual course. If you take a course cross-listed with HISTORY, but do not enroll in HISTORY, you will not meet the requisite. Example: HISTORY 200\nIn very limited situations, a minimum grade may be included associated with a requisite course (example: a grade of C in Course A). If you are a transfer student, you may need individual permission from the instructor to enroll in courses with this type of requisite. Example: NUTR SCI 431\nThese exam scores are converted into UW-Madison credit via equivalent courses. They do not display publicly in requisites. Due to the nature of the vast array of subject material there isn't always a direct equivalent (exact match from the exam to a UW-Madison course), thus credit will show up on your record as a transfer equivalent (denoted by SUBJECT X##, example GEN ELCT X12). See the list of exams and their equivalent UW-Madison courses in the Placement and Credit by Exam section of Guide.\nThe UW-System and UW-Madison provide placement exams in English, English as a Second Language (ESL), French, German, Math, Spanish and have direct equivalents to UW-Madison courses. Departments may also provide placement exams in other subject matter where a student may have acquired knowledge, skills, or competencies. Requisites use placement exam scores and use the language \"or placement into [course].\" Find more information about these exams and subsequent placement into UW-Madison courses in the Placement and Credit by Exam section of Guide. Example: FRENCH 102\nIf you are transferring to UW-Madison, their previous coursework will be converted to UW-Madison credit/courses. In most cases, you will see the equivalent UW-Madison course on your transcript, which can be used just like the courses above. If there is not a direct equivalent (exact match from your previous institution to a UW-Madison course), you will receive credit in any given subject as a transfer equivalent (denoted by SUBJECT X##, example GEN ELCT X12).\nIn some situations, you may have acquired subject matter knowledge, but did not complete all the learning outcomes associated with UW-Madison general education attributes or designations. Transfer equivalency courses used in this situation provide a transfer credit equivalent to course content without the general education requirement fulfillment. These are included in requisites behind the scenes.\nWhen requisites include a minimum letter grade, the transfer equivalency grade will factor in the requisite as a 2.000 GPA, regardless your grade from the previous institution.\nSome courses utilize the satisfaction of a specific general education requirement as a requisite. These are written as:\nTo see more about general education requirements, see the Requirements for Undergraduate Degrees in Guide.\nSome courses are designed for a specific audience. Requisites limit who can enroll in these courses.\nWhen a course covers a significant portion of another course, a requisite will prevent you from earning credit in courses that are vastly similar. These requisites include statements such as \"Not open to students with credit in [Course A]\", which will prevent you from enrolling in a course where you already have mastered the subject matter. Example: CHEM 327\nCourses may limit enrollment to students only in honors programs. Requisites for these courses will be written as:\nCourses can be designed for specific programs and will have requisites that specify who can enroll. You must be declared in one of these programs to enroll. Requisites will be written as:\nClass standing is based on the number of credits you have earned, credits in progress at time of enrollment, and your academic career (undergraduate, graduate, pharmacy, medical, veterinary, law, or special).\nRequisites using standing can be written in a variety of ways, depending on the audience. If the requisite is Sophomore standing, this includes sophomore, junior, senior, graduate/professional, or special career students. If the requisite is Sophomore standing only, only undergraduate students with 24-53 credits may enroll in the course.\nSome courses may only enroll when you have consent of instructor. These courses usually are independent study, directed study, etc. or courses that require auditions, permission the fist time, or other unique situations that are subjective. This is written as \"Consent of Instructor.\" Example: DANCE 159\nThe following statements were created for inclusion in course syllabi. Instructors are strongly encouraged to reference, or include a link to, these statements in their individual course syllabi. This ensures that consistent institutional information is provided to all students.\nAcademic Calendar & Religious Observances\nEstablishment of the academic calendar for the University of Wisconsin-Madison falls within the authority of the faculty as set forth in Faculty Policies and Procedures. Construction of the academic calendar is subject to various rules and laws prescribed by the Board of Regents, the Faculty Senate, State of Wisconsin and the federal government. For additional dates and deadlines for students, see the Office of the Registrar’s pages. Students are responsible for notifying instructors within the first two weeks of classes about any need for flexibility due to religious observances.\nBy virtue of enrollment, each student agrees to uphold the high academic standards of the University of Wisconsin-Madison; academic misconduct is behavior that negatively impacts the integrity of the institution. Cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration, and helping others commit these previously listed acts are examples of misconduct which may result in disciplinary action. Examples of disciplinary sanctions include, but are not limited to, failure on the assignment/course, written reprimand, disciplinary probation, suspension, or expulsion.\nThe University of Wisconsin-Madison supports the right of all enrolled students to a full and equal educational opportunity. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Wisconsin State Statute (36.12), and UW-Madison policy (UW-855) require the university to provide reasonable accommodations to students with disabilities to access and participate in its academic programs and educational services. Faculty and students share responsibility in the accommodation process. Students are expected to inform faculty of their need for instructional accommodations during the beginning of the semester, or as soon as possible after being approved for accommodations. Faculty will work either directly with the student or in coordination with the McBurney Center to provide reasonable instructional and course-related accommodations. Disability information, including instructional accommodations as part of a student's educational record, is confidential and protected under FERPA. (See: McBurney Disability Resource Center)\nUW-Madison students have the opportunity to evaluate the courses they are enrolled in and their learning experiences through course evaluations. Most instructors use a digital course evaluation tool. In most instances, students receive an official email two weeks prior to the end of the semester, notifying them that anonymous course evaluations are available. Student participation is an integral component of course development, and confidential feedback is important. UW-Madison strongly encourages student participation in course evaluations.\nDiversity is a source of strength, creativity, and innovation for UW-Madison. We value the contributions of each person and respect the profound ways their identity, culture, background, experience, status, abilities, and opinion enrich the university community. We commit ourselves to the pursuit of excellence in teaching, research, outreach, and diversity as inextricably linked goals. The University of Wisconsin-Madison fulfills its public mission by creating a welcoming and inclusive community for people from every background – people who as students, faculty, and staff serve Wisconsin and the world.\nStudents often experience stressors that can impact both their academic experience and personal well-being. These may include mental health concerns, substance misuse, sexual or relationship violence, family circumstances, campus climate, financial matters, among others.\nStudents are encouraged to learn about and utilize UW-Madison's mental health services and/or other resources as needed.

Students in courses may use the materials and recordings for their personal use related to participation in class. Students may also take notes solely for their personal use. If a lecture is not already recorded, students are not authorized to record lectures without permission unless they are considered by the university to be a qualified student with a disability who has an approved accommodation that includes recording. [Regent Policy Document 4-1] Students may not copy or have lecture materials and recordings outside of class, including posting on internet sites or selling to commercial entities, with the exception of sharing copies of personal notes as a notetaker through the McBurney Disability Resource Center. Students are otherwise prohibited from providing or selling their personal notes to anyone else or being paid for taking notes by any person or commercial firm without the instructor’s express written permission. Unauthorized use of these copyrighted lecture materials and recordings constitutes copyright infringement and may be addressed under the university’s policies, UWS Chapters 14 and 17, governing student academic and non-academic misconduct.\nRights & Responsibilities\nThe privacy and security of faculty, staff and students’ personal information is a top priority for UW-Madison. The university carefully reviews and vets all campus-supported digital tools used for teaching and learning, including those that support data empowered educational practices and proctoring. View the university’s full teaching and learning data transparency statement.\n• Skip to Content\n• AZ Index\n• Catalog Home\n• Accounting and Information Systems (ACCT I S)\n• Actuarial Science (ACT SCI)\n• African American Studies (AFROAMER)\n• African Cultural Studies (AFRICAN)\n• Agricultural and Applied Economics (A A E)\n• Agroecology (AGROECOL)\n• Air Force Aerospace Studies (A F AERO)\n• American Indian Studies (AMER IND)\n• Anatomy (ANATOMY)\n• Anatomy & Physiology (ANAT&PHY)\n• Anesthesiology (ANESTHES)\n• Animal Sciences (AN SCI)\n• Anthropology (ANTHRO)\n• Applied Biotechnology (ABT)\n• Art Department (ART)\n• Art Education (Department of Art) (ART ED)\n• Art History (ART HIST)\n• Asian American Studies (ASIAN AM)\n• Asian Languages and Cultures (ASIAN)\n• Asian Languages and Cultures: Languages (ASIALANG)\n• Astronomy (ASTRON)\n• Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences (ATM OCN)\n• Biochemistry (BIOCHEM)\n• Biological Systems Engineering (BSE)\n• Biology (BIOLOGY)\n• Biology Core Curriculum (BIOCORE)\n• Biomedical Engineering (B M E)\n• Biomedical Sciences and Technologies (BIOMDSCI)\n• Biomolecular Chemistry (BMOLCHEM)\n• Biostatistics and Medical Informatics (B M I)\n• Botany (BOTANY)\n• Cell and Regenerative Biology (CRB)\n• Chemical and Biological Engineering (CBE)\n• Chemistry (CHEM)\n• Chicana/o and Latina/o Studies (CHICLA)\n• Civil and Environmental Engineering (CIV ENGR)\n• Civil Society and Community Studies (CSCS)\n• Classics (CLASSICS)\n• Collaborative Nursing Program (CNP)\n• Communication Arts (COM ARTS)\n• Communication Sciences and Disorders (CS&D)\n• Community and Environmental Sociology (C&E SOC)\n• Comparative Biosciences (COMP BIO)\n• Comparative Literature (COMP LIT)\n• Computer Sciences (COMP SCI)\n• Consumer Science (CNSR SCI)\n• Counseling Psychology (COUN PSY)\n• Curriculum and Instruction (CURRIC)\n• Dairy Science (DY SCI)\n• Dance (DANCE)\n• Dermatology (DERM)\n• Design Studies (DS)\n• Economics (ECON)\n• Educational Leadership and Policy Analysis (ELPA)\n• Educational Policy Studies (ED POL)\n• Educational Psychology (ED PSYCH)\n• Electrical and Computer Engineering (E C E)\n• Emergency Medicine (EMER MED)\n• Engineering Mechanics and Aerospace Engineering (E M A)\n• Engineering Physics (E P)\n• Engineering Professional Development (E P D)\n• English as a Second Language (ESL)\n• English (ENGL)\n• Entomology (ENTOM)\n• Environmental Studies -

specific fields or in more advanced courses in communication.Quantitative Reasoning Part A: a Quantitative Reasoning Part A course is an introductory course in college‐level mathematics, computer science, statistics or formal logic that prepares students for more advanced work in a disciplinary context.Quantitative Reasoning Part B: a Quantitative Reasoning Part B course builds on the tools of college‐level mathematics, computer science, statistics or formal logic that are acquired by achieving the Quantitative Reasoning Part A learning outcomes. Quantitative Reasoning Part B courses may be offered at any level, provided that the material challenges students to think critically and apply quantitative skills to develop models, interpret data, draw conclusions, and solve problems within a disciplinary or interdisciplinary context.\nEthnic St | Counts toward Ethnic Studies requirement: a course intended to increase understanding of the culture and contributions of persistently marginalized racial or ethnic groups in the United States, and to equip students to respond constructively to issues connected with our pluralistic society and global community.\nBreadth | Biological Science: a course concerning the systematic study of the structure, function, growth, origin, evolution, distribution, and taxonomy of living organisms. Courses with this designation may meet Biological Science requirements or the broader Natural Science breadth requirements.Humanities: employing analytical, critical, and interpretive methods, “Arts & Humanities” courses teach a wide array of skills necessary to understand and analyze past, present, and future of the world around us. These courses focus on exploring the human condition, using knowledge to build empathy and appreciation for the complexities of one’s own and other people’s perspectives. Literature: courses with “literature” designation focus on the reading and interpretation of texts in multiple genres, including fictional and nonfictional prose, poetry, and drama, from a range of cultures, in translation or in their original languages, irrespective of how they are presented. They teach skills of literary analysis while examining the relation between the texts and the cultures, historical periods, and ideas that produced them. Natural Science: a course characterized by the systematic study of the natural and physical world, and with the use of abstraction and logical reasoning. Biological Science and Physical Science courses are subsets of the Natural Science curriculum.  Physical Science: a course involving the systematic study of objective information about the physical world, broadly defined, and include areas of study such as Astronomy, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Materials Science, and Earth Science (atmospheric science, oceanography). Courses with this designation may meet Physical Science requirements or the broader Natural Science breadth requirements.Social Science: a course which relies upon methods of data collection (either qualitative or quantitative), data analysis, or data interpretation that characterize factual, methodological, institutional, and theoretical inquiry into the systematic study of humans/groups and institutions/society.\nLevel | Elementary: a course associated with predominantly introductory material, are usually open to all students (including first year students).Intermediate and Advanced: courses with sensible prerequisites to reflect a gradual mastery of material.\nL&S Credit | Counts as Liberal Arts and Science credit in L&S: a course which encourage students in one or more of the three “habits of the mind” of liberal arts education, as specified by the College of Letters and Science.\nHonors | Accelerated Honors (!): a course open to both honors and non-honors students. Accelerated Honors courses receive honors credit automatically in recognition of the amount and rigor of material covered in the course, often designed to combine two semesters of material into one semester. The enrollment system will automatically assign honors.Honors Only Courses (H): a course reserved for students declared in an Honors program only, taught by a faculty member who is an expert in the subject-matter of the course. It is designed to challenge students to actively participate; hence, the course content is often shaped by student questions and interests.

School Policies\n[HEADING] Academic Calendar\n[HEADING] Contact Information\nThe Graduate Guide provides an overview of UW–Madison programs that offer graduate degrees, doctoral minors, graduate/professional certificates, and capstone certificates. The Graduate Guide is the key source for program-specific policies regarding admission, degree requirements, funding, prior coursework, and more.\nThe information in this Guide is current for the academic year, including the summer, fall, and spring terms. The Guide is an official document of record and is reviewed and updated every year.\nThe Guide is published only online; printed copies are not available. Archived editions from past years are available in the Archive.\nStudents are responsible for meeting the academic requirements that were in effect at the time they matriculated, including satisfactory progress and degree requirements. In situations when academic requirements change during a student’s time of enrollment, the Graduate School and the academic program, together with the student, may elect to enforce requirements that are in the best interest of the student.\nThe UW–Madison Graduate School confers:\nThe Graduate School oversees the administration of those degrees, doctoral minors, graduate/professional certificates, and capstone certificates. Some major programs have identified sub-majors, known as “named options”. Official named options are approved by university governance and appear on the transcript when the degree is conferred. Some programs also have unofficial pathways that do not appear on the transcript.\nDegree programs must be rationally unified, with courses that contribute to an organized program of study and/or research. Courses must be selected from groups embracing one principal subject of concentration called the major (see Degrees).\nThe major field is normally coextensive with the work of a single department or with one of the subjects under which certain programs have been formally arranged.  The Graduate School requires all doctoral programs to incorporate a breadth requirement. The breadth requirement is designed to represent a coherent body of work, taken as a graduate student, and should not be simply an after-the-fact ratification of a number of courses taken outside the major department.\nGraduate School minimum credits and other requirements necessary to earn degrees are listed in the Graduate School Minimum Degree Requirements and Policies sections; each program may set degree requirements and expectations more stringent than Graduate School policy.\nThe Graduate School offers links to information about admissions, program data profiles, funding resources, diversity, professional development, graduate student life, and other resources.\nThe Graduate School's Academic Policies and Procedures Glossary provides information about Graduate School academic and administrative policies, procedures and definitions of commonly used terms in graduate education. Note some policies redirect to entries in the official UW–Madison Policy Library. This glossary reflects current policies and procedures of the Graduate School, the Office of the Registrar, the Office of the Bursar, the International Students Services (ISS), and other university units.\nGraduate Assistant Policies and Procedures (GAPP) outlines employment-related practices for graduate student teaching, research, and project assistantships.\nThe Graduate School Office of Professional Development and Communications (OPDC) coordinates, develops, and promotes learning opportunities to foster the academic, professional, and life skills of graduate students.\nProfessional development topics include Individual Development Plans, communication, mentoring, grant writing, dissertation writing, career exploration, job search strategies, and more. The office provides a wealth of resources and events tailored to the needs of UW–Madison graduate students.\nThe Office of Professional Development and Communications developed and maintains DiscoverPD, an innovative tool for UW–Madison graduate students to advance their academic and professional goals. DiscoverPD introduces eight areas (or \"facets\") of professional development, includes a self-assessment, and provides a customized report of areas of strength and weakness. The report comes with recommendations to help graduate students strengthen their ability within each area.\nMore information on campus resources for student professional development is available at Professional Development. Students may keep up-to-date by reading GradConnections, the newsletter for graduate students, bookmarking the Events Calendar to keep tabs on upcoming workshops of interest, and following the Graduate School’s X, Facebook, YouTube, or Instagram accounts.\nThe University of Wisconsin-Madison is committed to providing equal opportunity and equal access in compliance with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations and Universities of Wisconsin and university non-discrimination policies and procedures.\nThe Office of Compliance promotes ethical conduct and compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and UW-Madison policies. UW-Madison’s non-discrimination statement, contact information for the university’s Equal Opportunity Investigations Administrator, Title IX Coordinator, ADA Coordinator as well as information regarding UW-Madison’s Equal Opportunity Complaint process is available on the Office of Compliance’s website.\nThe McBurney Disability Resource Center is an office within the Division of Student Affairs that views disability as an important aspect of the diversity of UW-Madison. The Center is committed to creating an accessible and inclusive educational experience for students, by partnering with students, faculty, and staff to design accessible environments and to provide academic accommodations so that students can engage, explore and participate in the Wisconsin Idea.\nThe Center works with UW-Madison students with physical, learning, hearing, vision, psychological, health and other disabilities substantially affecting a major life activity (e.g., walking, communicating, learning, seeing, breathing, reading, etc.). Many students have non-apparent disabilities such as depression, anxiety, autism spectrum, learning disabilities, AD/HD and health conditions such as Crohn’s disease or fibromyalgia.\nCommon accommodations include extended time and/or small group environment for exams, note taking support, sign language interpreting, real time and media captioning, and conversion of printed materials to accessible formats. McBurney Center staff members also collaborate with students and faculty to determine reasonable flexibility with regard to attendance, participation, and deadlines for conditions that fluctuate in severity over the course of enrollment. The Center makes referrals to other campus offices or community resources for non-classroom accommodations related to housing, transportation, personal care needs, and so on. Students should contact the Center upon admission to begin the eligibility for services process. Early notice is essential in order to have accommodations in place prior to the start of the semester. For detailed information, see apply for accommodations.\nMcBurney Disability Resource Center 702 West Johnson Street, Suite 2104 Madison, WI 53706 608-263-2741 (voice) 608-225-7956 (text) 608-265-2998 (fax) mcburney@studentlife.wisc.edu www.mcburney.wisc.edu\nThe University of Wisconsin–Madison is accredited by the:\nHigher Learning Commission\n230 South Lasalle Street, Suite 7-500\nChicago, IL 60604\ntelephone 1-800-621-7440\nwww.hlcommission.org\nUW–Madison, which was first accredited in 1913, was last accredited in 2019, and will go through a reaccreditation process again in 2028–29.\nSee Mark of Affiliation.\nRegistration with the Minnesota Office of Higher Education: The University of Wisconsin–Madison is a public institution registered as a \"Private Institution\" with the Minnesota Office of Higher Education pursuant to sections 136A.61 to 136A.71. Registration is not an endorsement of the institution. Credits earned at the institution may not transfer to all other institutions.\nThe information, policies, and rules contained herein are subject to change.\nFilter Graduate Degrees\nExplore Graduate School Program Data\nView as list View as grid\nThe university offers several degree and capstone certificate programs that are fully or partially available at a distance or that are flexible to working schedules with evening and/or weekend courses. To learn more about the graduate-level degrees and certificates offered in flexible and online formats, visit the Wisconsin Professional Degrees & Certificates portal.\nBreadth is a required component of doctoral training at UW–Madison. A student’s doctoral major program determines how breadth is achieved: students either complete an additional program of a doctoral minor or graduate/professional certificate, or breadth is built into the doctoral major program curriculum. Most major programs advise students to enroll in a doctoral minor or graduate/professional certificate to meet the breadth requirement. If a doctoral minor or graduate/professional/capstone certificate is not required by the student’s doctoral major program, it is noted on the Requirements tab of the Guide degree or named option page. See the Graduate School: Breadth Requirement in Doctoral Training policy for minimum course requirements for the minor.\nView as list View as grid\nGraduate/professional certificates are available to all degree-seeking graduate and professional students (Graduate, Law, Medicine, Pharmacy, Veterinary Medicine careers) and meet the Graduate School’s breadth requirement. Graduate/professional certificate programs coordinate teaching and research among scholars active in interrelated disciplines.\nView as list View as grid\nCapstone certificates allow individuals with a bachelor’s degree to obtain additional professional skills. Capstones do not lead to the conferral of a degree but do appear on a student’s UW–Madison transcript.\nGraduate students are not eligible to enroll in capstone certificates.\nCapstone certificate students are admitted as University Special students through Adult Career and Special Student Services (ACSSS). ACSSS is the academic dean and is responsible for issues related to student enrollment and the student's official record.\nAn Adult Career and Special Student Services student services coordinator works with each department's capstone certificate coordinator on advising, admissions, enrollment eligibility, and program completion. Capstone certificates typically follow the rules of the Graduate School for tuition, credit limits, and grading.\nThe availability of a capstone certificate program to an international student varies as follows:\nView as list View as grid\nThe University of Wisconsin–Madison has offered graduate study for more than a century. The faculty of more than 2,000 distinguished scholars and teachers, supported by an academic staff exceeding 10,000 confers graduate degrees in more than 160 fields of study.\nAs one of the nation's major research institutions, the university maintains extensive research facilities.\nKeep in mind:\nAdmitted graduate students may request a change to their initial term of enrollment, provided the request is supported by a valid reason as outlined here and receives approval from both the admitting program and the Graduate School. International students must comply with full-time enrollment requirements applicable to their new term of entry.\nAcceptance of an offer of financial support* (such as a graduate scholarship, fellowship, traineeship, or assistantship) for the next academic year by a prospective or enrolled graduate student completes an agreement that both student and graduate school expect to honor. In that context, the conditions affecting such offers and their acceptance must be defined carefully and understood by all parties.\nStudents are under no obligation to respond to offers of financial support prior to April 15. Earlier deadlines for acceptance of such offers violate the intent of this Resolution. If an applicant accepts an offer before April 15 and then decides to withdraw that acceptance, they may submit in writing a resignation of the appointment at any time through April 15. Applicants must inform the program that they are withdrawing their acceptance of the offer, they then can accept any other offers.\nIt is further agreed by the institutions and organizations subscribing to the above Resolution that a copy of this Resolution or a link to the URL should accompany every scholarship, fellowship, traineeship, and assistantship offer.\n*Note that this Resolution applies to offers of financial support only, not offers of admission.\nStudents are responsible for reviewing Guide and obtaining specific program requirements from the program. Many programs publish a graduate student handbook, which provides more details about graduate study and other policies and processes.\nThe table below includes Graduate School minimum degree requirements and other information that is featured on each program page. Schools/colleges, departments and programs may set more stringent requirements than the Graduate School.\nMA, MS, MAcc, MBA, MM, MEng, MIPA, MPA, MSW\nAuD, DMA, DNP, OTD, PhD\nAll doctoral students are required to complete a doctoral minor or graduate/professional certificate. Refer to the Graduate School: Breadth Requirement in Doctoral Training policy.\nFor more information, please consult the Graduate School Academic Policies and Procedures.\nAll institutional policies can be found in the policy library. The table below highlights select Graduate School academic policies. Programs may set more stringent policies than the Graduate School. Refer to specific program pages for more information.\nEstablishment of the academic calendar for the University of Wisconsin–Madison falls within the authority of the faculty as set forth in Faculty Policies and Procedures. Construction of the academic calendar is subject to various rules and guidelines prescribed by the Board of Regents, the Faculty Senate and State of Wisconsin legislation. The Faculty Senate approves an academic calendar which spans a future five-year period.\nGraduate Schoolgrad.wisc.edu\n• Skip to Content\n• AZ Index\n• Catalog Home\n• Editions and Archives\n•

School Policies\n[HEADING] Academic Calendar\n[HEADING] Contact Information\nThe Graduate Guide provides an overview of UW–Madison programs that offer graduate degrees, doctoral minors, graduate/professional certificates, and capstone certificates. The Graduate Guide is the key source for program-specific policies regarding admission, degree requirements, funding, prior coursework, and more.\nThe information in this Guide is current for the academic year, including the summer, fall, and spring terms. The Guide is an official document of record and is reviewed and updated every year.\nThe Guide is published only online; printed copies are not available. Archived editions from past years are available in the Archive.\nStudents are responsible for meeting the academic requirements that were in effect at the time they matriculated, including satisfactory progress and degree requirements. In situations when academic requirements change during a student’s time of enrollment, the Graduate School and the academic program, together with the student, may elect to enforce requirements that are in the best interest of the student.\nThe UW–Madison Graduate School confers:\nThe Graduate School oversees the administration of those degrees, doctoral minors, graduate/professional certificates, and capstone certificates. Some major programs have identified sub-majors, known as “named options”. Official named options are approved by university governance and appear on the transcript when the degree is conferred. Some programs also have unofficial pathways that do not appear on the transcript.\nDegree programs must be rationally unified, with courses that contribute to an organized program of study and/or research. Courses must be selected from groups embracing one principal subject of concentration called the major (see Degrees).\nThe major field is normally coextensive with the work of a single department or with one of the subjects under which certain programs have been formally arranged.  The Graduate School requires all doctoral programs to incorporate a breadth requirement. The breadth requirement is designed to represent a coherent body of work, taken as a graduate student, and should not be simply an after-the-fact ratification of a number of courses taken outside the major department.\nGraduate School minimum credits and other requirements necessary to earn degrees are listed in the Graduate School Minimum Degree Requirements and Policies sections; each program may set degree requirements and expectations more stringent than Graduate School policy.\nThe Graduate School offers links to information about admissions, program data profiles, funding resources, diversity, professional development, graduate student life, and other resources.\nThe Graduate School's Academic Policies and Procedures Glossary provides information about Graduate School academic and administrative policies, procedures and definitions of commonly used terms in graduate education. Note some policies redirect to entries in the official UW–Madison Policy Library. This glossary reflects current policies and procedures of the Graduate School, the Office of the Registrar, the Office of the Bursar, the International Students Services (ISS), and other university units.\nGraduate Assistant Policies and Procedures (GAPP) outlines employment-related practices for graduate student teaching, research, and project assistantships.\nThe Graduate School Office of Professional Development and Communications (OPDC) coordinates, develops, and promotes learning opportunities to foster the academic, professional, and life skills of graduate students.\nProfessional development topics include Individual Development Plans, communication, mentoring, grant writing, dissertation writing, career exploration, job search strategies, and more. The office provides a wealth of resources and events tailored to the needs of UW–Madison graduate students.\nThe Office of Professional Development and Communications developed and maintains DiscoverPD, an innovative tool for UW–Madison graduate students to advance their academic and professional goals. DiscoverPD introduces eight areas (or \"facets\") of professional development, includes a self-assessment, and provides a customized report of areas of strength and weakness. The report comes with recommendations to help graduate students strengthen their ability within each area.\nMore information on campus resources for student professional development is available at Professional Development. Students may keep up-to-date by reading GradConnections, the newsletter for graduate students, bookmarking the Events Calendar to keep tabs on upcoming workshops of interest, and following the Graduate School’s X, Facebook, YouTube, or Instagram accounts.\nThe University of Wisconsin-Madison is committed to providing equal opportunity and equal access in compliance with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations and Universities of Wisconsin and university non-discrimination policies and procedures.\nThe Office of Compliance promotes ethical conduct and compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and UW-Madison policies. UW-Madison’s non-discrimination statement, contact information for the university’s Equal Opportunity Investigations Administrator, Title IX Coordinator, ADA Coordinator as well as information regarding UW-Madison’s Equal Opportunity Complaint process is available on the Office of Compliance’s website.\nThe McBurney Disability Resource Center is an office within the Division of Student Affairs that views disability as an important aspect of the diversity of UW-Madison. The Center is committed to creating an accessible and inclusive educational experience for students, by partnering with students, faculty, and staff to design accessible environments and to provide academic accommodations so that students can engage, explore and participate in the Wisconsin Idea.\nThe Center works with UW-Madison students with physical, learning, hearing, vision, psychological, health and other disabilities substantially affecting a major life activity (e.g., walking, communicating, learning, seeing, breathing, reading, etc.). Many students have non-apparent disabilities such as depression, anxiety, autism spectrum, learning disabilities, AD/HD and health conditions such as Crohn’s disease or fibromyalgia.\nCommon accommodations include extended time and/or small group environment for exams, note taking support, sign language interpreting, real time and media captioning, and conversion of printed materials to accessible formats. McBurney Center staff members also collaborate with students and faculty to determine reasonable flexibility with regard to attendance, participation, and deadlines for conditions that fluctuate in severity over the course of enrollment. The Center makes referrals to other campus offices or community resources for non-classroom accommodations related to housing, transportation, personal care needs, and so on. Students should contact the Center upon admission to begin the eligibility for services process. Early notice is essential in order to have accommodations in place prior to the start of the semester. For detailed information, see apply for accommodations.\nMcBurney Disability Resource Center 702 West Johnson Street, Suite 2104 Madison, WI 53706 608-263-2741 (voice) 608-225-7956 (text) 608-265-2998 (fax) mcburney@studentlife.wisc.edu www.mcburney.wisc.edu\nThe University of Wisconsin–Madison is accredited by the:\nHigher Learning Commission\n230 South Lasalle Street, Suite 7-500\nChicago, IL 60604\ntelephone 1-800-621-7440\nwww.hlcommission.org\nUW–Madison, which was first accredited in 1913, was last accredited in 2019, and will go through a reaccreditation process again in 2028–29.\nSee Mark of Affiliation.\nRegistration with the Minnesota Office of Higher Education: The University of Wisconsin–Madison is a public institution registered as a \"Private Institution\" with the Minnesota Office of Higher Education pursuant to sections 136A.61 to 136A.71.

To learn more about the graduate-level degrees and certificates offered in flexible and online formats, visit the Wisconsin Professional Degrees & Certificates portal.\nBreadth is a required component of doctoral training at UW–Madison. A student’s doctoral major program determines how breadth is achieved: students either complete an additional program of a doctoral minor or graduate/professional certificate, or breadth is built into the doctoral major program curriculum. Most major programs advise students to enroll in a doctoral minor or graduate/professional certificate to meet the breadth requirement. If a doctoral minor or graduate/professional/capstone certificate is not required by the student’s doctoral major program, it is noted on the Requirements tab of the Guide degree or named option page. See the Graduate School: Breadth Requirement in Doctoral Training policy for minimum course requirements for the minor.\nView as list View as grid\nGraduate/professional certificates are available to all degree-seeking graduate and professional students (Graduate, Law, Medicine, Pharmacy, Veterinary Medicine careers) and meet the Graduate School’s breadth requirement. Graduate/professional certificate programs coordinate teaching and research among scholars active in interrelated disciplines.\nView as list View as grid\nCapstone certificates allow individuals with a bachelor’s degree to obtain additional professional skills. Capstones do not lead to the conferral of a degree but do appear on a student’s UW–Madison transcript.\nGraduate students are not eligible to enroll in capstone certificates.\nCapstone certificate students are admitted as University Special students through Adult Career and Special Student Services (ACSSS). ACSSS is the academic dean and is responsible for issues related to student enrollment and the student's official record.\nAn Adult Career and Special Student Services student services coordinator works with each department's capstone certificate coordinator on advising, admissions, enrollment eligibility, and program completion. Capstone certificates typically follow the rules of the Graduate School for tuition, credit limits, and grading.\nThe availability of a capstone certificate program to an international student varies as follows:\nView as list View as grid\nThe University of Wisconsin–Madison has offered graduate study for more than a century. The faculty of more than 2,000 distinguished scholars and teachers, supported by an academic staff exceeding 10,000 confers graduate degrees in more than 160 fields of study.\nAs one of the nation's major research institutions, the university maintains extensive research facilities.\nKeep in mind:\nAdmitted graduate students may request a change to their initial term of enrollment, provided the request is supported by a valid reason as outlined here and receives approval from both the admitting program and the Graduate School. International students must comply with full-time enrollment requirements applicable to their new term of entry.\nAcceptance of an offer of financial support* (such as a graduate scholarship, fellowship, traineeship, or assistantship) for the next academic year by a prospective or enrolled graduate student completes an agreement that both student and graduate school expect to honor. In that context, the conditions affecting such offers and their acceptance must be defined carefully and understood by all parties.\nStudents are under no obligation to respond to offers of financial support prior to April 15. Earlier deadlines for acceptance of such offers violate the intent of this Resolution. If an applicant accepts an offer before April 15 and then decides to withdraw that acceptance, they may submit in writing a resignation of the appointment at any time through April 15. Applicants must inform the program that they are withdrawing their acceptance of the offer, they then can accept any other offers.\nIt is further agreed by the institutions and organizations subscribing to the above Resolution that a copy of this Resolution or a link to the URL should accompany every scholarship, fellowship, traineeship, and assistantship offer.\n*Note that this Resolution applies to offers of financial support only, not offers of admission.\nStudents are responsible for reviewing Guide and obtaining specific program requirements from the program. Many programs publish a graduate student handbook, which provides more details about graduate study and other policies and processes.\nThe table below includes Graduate School minimum degree requirements and other information that is featured on each program page. Schools/colleges, departments and programs may set more stringent requirements than the Graduate School.\nMA, MS, MAcc, MBA, MM, MEng, MIPA, MPA, MSW\nAuD, DMA, DNP, OTD, PhD\nAll doctoral students are required to complete a doctoral minor or graduate/professional certificate. Refer to the Graduate School: Breadth Requirement in Doctoral Training policy.\nFor more information, please consult the Graduate School Academic Policies and Procedures.\nAll institutional policies can be found in the policy library. The table below highlights select Graduate School academic policies. Programs may set more stringent policies than the Graduate School. Refer to specific program pages for more information.\nEstablishment of the academic calendar for the University of Wisconsin–Madison falls within the authority of the faculty as set forth in Faculty Policies and Procedures. Construction of the academic calendar is subject to various rules and guidelines prescribed by the Board of Regents, the Faculty Senate and State of Wisconsin legislation. The Faculty Senate approves an academic calendar which spans a future five-year period.\nGraduate Schoolgrad.wisc.edu\n• Skip to Content\n• AZ Index\n• Catalog Home\n• Editions and Archives\n•
