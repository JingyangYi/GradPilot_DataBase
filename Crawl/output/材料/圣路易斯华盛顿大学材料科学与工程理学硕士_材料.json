The student must provide an official transcript, course description and/or syllabi, text book title and an indication of a matching Wash U course. A grade of B or better is required for transfer courses. The transfer courses must be graduate level and did not count toward the completion of an undergraduate degree.\nNo, only courses taken for a grade count toward the degree requirements. A student may choose to take a course as P/F in order to gain the knowledge needed for another course in the program. P/F courses count toward full-time status.  Audited courses do not count toward degrees, grade point averages nor full-time status.  P/F courses and Audit courses are charged regular tuition.\nIf it is a degree from a different department within the School of Engineering, you may need to complete an application. A graduate certificate may require a mini-application and/or permission from the Program Director. Contact the Graduate Admissions department for specifics on whether or not an application is required.\nThe number of units may vary depending on the degree. Typically a minimum of 15 unique units will be required for the second master's degree. The date the course was first taken must be within a maximum of 10 years. Courses become outdated and therefore would not count toward a current degree.",
