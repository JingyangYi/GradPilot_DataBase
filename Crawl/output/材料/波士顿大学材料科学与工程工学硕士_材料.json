This program also offers part-time study options.\r\n \r\n\r\nfinance your education,\r\n\nDeadlines\nfinance your education,\r\n\nDeadlines\nThe MSE MEng program is aimed at: i) Graduating senior students who want a quick one-year master’s in materials before they look for industrial jobs. ii) Mid-career professionals who want to switch careers and would like to complete a one-year master’s degree between jobs. (iii) Industry professionals who want exposure to materials science and engineering and engineering management to further their careers, by complementing technical MSE courses with an engineering management focus that emphasizes elements of technology leadership and product development and management.\nThe MSE MEng Program Planning Sheet is found in the MSE Master’s Handbook, under the Forms tab. The planning sheet provides a “snapshot” view of the curriculum. You will submit a final program planning sheet, with advisor signature, when you apply to graduate.\nMSE Master’s Handbook\nFor Application Deadlines, Requirements and Fee Waiver information, see the Graduate Admissions web page.\nMaster’s students may add the optional “with Engineering Practice” designation to their degree by completing an approved internship in their field of study. The program option recognizes the power of combining rigorous academic coursework with supervised real-world research or industrial applications. Participating students add value to their academic experience with a related internship that enables them to both develop and apply their technical, project management, and leadership skills.

The program option recognizes the power of combining rigorous academic coursework with supervised real-world research or industrial applications. Participating students add value to their academic experience with a related internship that enables them to both develop and apply their technical, project management, and leadership skills.\nStudents should refer to the Internship Guidance (Engineering Practice and CPT) provided by the College of Engineering.  This webpage provides guidance for Masters, PhD, and International students as well as required documents and the Engineering Practice Approval Form.\nThe College of Engineering Graduate Programs Office manages the Engineering with Practice and CPT process.  Please direct questions to enggrad@bu.edu.  The Division Director can provide additional support as needed.\nStudents are encouraged to discuss their research interests with faculty at the beginning of their masters program and enroll in their second semester.\nMS candidates choosing the thesis option must enroll in ENG MS 954 Thesis for at least 4 credits; no more than 8 credits of thesis research can count towards the MS degree. Thesis work is likely to entail several semesters of research; as a result, completion of the masters with thesis degree usually requires more than one year.\nA research problem is selected after initial discussions between the research advisor and the student. The development of a thesis topic is typically a cooperative effort between the student and research advisor. Commonly, the advisor initially suggests a problem to be addressed, but the student is expected to contribute ideas and thought as to how to approach the problem.\nMS Thesis candidates shall demonstrate their abilities for independent research and scholarship by completing a written thesis in their field of study. The thesis will be primarily guided by the first reader (advisor), with the advice of the other member(s) of the Thesis Committee. The thesis should represent original scientific/engineering contributions that are appropriate for publication in a recognized peer-reviewed journal. The thesis is defended at a presentation open to the entire BU community and submitted to the Mugar Library to satisfy the requirements of the MS with Thesis degree.\nBefore a student may enroll in ENG MS 954 Thesis, a Thesis Committee must be formed.\nThe student must submit the following forms (see Forms section) to the Graduate Programs Manager at mse@bu.edu:\nThesis Committee\nThe Thesis Committee must have a minimum of two members, one of which must be an MSE appointed faculty member. The student’s research advisor will chair the thesis committee. The Thesis Committee is charged with assessing the appropriateness of the research problem and the student’s preparation, based on the written proposal and the oral presentation. The Thesis Committee must approve that the Thesis is at a stage appropriate for scheduling the final presentation via their signature on the Final Thesis Presentation form and on the signature page of the thesis submitted to the Mugar Library.\nIf a researcher from outside the University serves on a student’s committee, a Special Service Appointment Form (see Forms section) must be completed and submitted to the Division Graduate Programs Manager for division approval. The completed form and a copy of the person’s curriculum vitae, with the Associate Chair for Graduate Studies’ signature, will then be submitted to the Graduate Programs Office.\nStudents who receive support from sponsored research programs or who make significant use of BU funds and facilities are required to sign the BU Intellectual Property Policy Agreement. Seek counsel with your faculty advisor about this policy pertaining to intellectual property. A signed form is required for thesis students. Click here for the Intellectual Property Policy Agreement and form (Appendix A).\nOccasionally MS students enter the program with a specific research advisor in mind and may even plan to work on a specific project. The majority of students, however, will utilize the first two semesters to determine what their specific interests are in the field of materials science and engineering and identify the opportunities for funding in a professor’s lab.\nMS with Thesis students typically connect with their research advisors through (1) doing lab rotations and deciding upon a research area; (2) interacting with faculty through coursework and informal discussions. Students can check the list of current Faculty Research Interests and MSE Laboratory and Research Center Descriptions, available on the MSE website.\nAnother valuable way of learning more about specific research opportunities is to speak with other graduate students who are currently working in the various MSE faculty labs. The best measure for learning about working in a specific lab is to make an appointment to speak with the faculty member in charge of a lab you are interested in.\nOnce a student finds a research opportunity and has the consent of a faculty member to be his/her advisor, the process of developing a research project begins.\nMasters students considering a thesis may seek out laboratory rotations during the first year. This provides the students an opportunity to gain exposure to more than one research area and to help in identifying a good match with a thesis advisor.\nAny full-time member of the MSE faculty, or any affiliated or adjunct faculty member who has an appointment with the Division, is eligible to serve as a research advisor. The thesis advisor will supervise the student’s thesis project and advise. MS with Thesis students are expected to choose a thesis advisor no later than the end of the second semester of matriculation. The thesis advisor is also the student’s academic advisor.\nThe Final Thesis Presentation (see registration process, below) is a public presentation of the candidate’s thesis. The presentation should clearly define the problem, describe the method(s) used to solve the problem, report results and establish significance of the results. The purpose of the Final Thesis Presentation is to ensure that the thesis constitutes a worthy contribution to knowledge in the candidate’s field and that the candidate has attained an expertise in his/her field of research specialization.\nPrevious Masters theses are available for review in the Division. Please see the Division Graduate Programs Manager.\nPlease refer to the Guide for Writers of Theses & Dissertations while preparing the thesis and abstract. These must conform to the requirements of the University Microfilms International.  The process includes submitting a draft to theses@bu.edu for comment on formatting; the thesis cannot be submitted via ETD until approved by the Library.\nAlthough students will have an opportunity to make final revisions to the thesis and abstract after their Final Thesis Presentation, they should not regard their Final Presentation version as a “rough draft.”\nAt least two weeks prior to the Thesis Presentation date, the candidate must Register the Presentation Online.\nUpon registration, the Graduate Programs Manager will circulate the abstract and final thesis presentation forms using Adobe Sign and will assist with scheduling a room, preparing the thesis announcement, and arranging catering.\nBefore registering the presentation, the candidate must have provided a copy of the thesis document to all members of the Final Thesis Presentation committee. It is the student’s responsibility for scheduling a date, location and time with all the Thesis Committee members for the examination.\nThe thesis chair should introduce the candidate and include a brief academic background description. The candidate should restrict the length of the examination to approximately one-hour. During this period, either the Thesis Committee members or audience may ask questions of clarification. The chair should guard against digression and inappropriate questioning during the presentation. After the presentation, a reasonable period of questioning will follow, and then the audience will be dismissed. The Thesis Committee may wish at this time to ask additional questions of the candidate. Following this additional questioning, the candidate should be excused and the committee should complete its assessment of the examination.\nThe Thesis Committee is charged with assessing completeness of the research, contribution to knowledge, and the candidate’s mastery of his/her research area, based on the written thesis and the oral presentation. Vote may be ballot or voice. A unanimous vote is required for a candidate to pass.\nIt is the chair’s responsibility to call the candidate back after the Thesis Committee has reached a decision. The chair will advise the student of the committee’s decision. At this time the candidate will be advised of any changes that must be made to the final title, abstract or thesis document, with a deadline provided by the Thesis Committee.\nThe MS Final Thesis Presentation Form must be completed at the examination, with specific indication of whether the title, abstract and thesis are acceptable as they stand. If ALL requirements are acceptable, the committee members should sign the signature pages of the thesis. If there is some rework to be done, this is to be noted on the Final Thesis Presentation form. Thesis Defense Committee members should sign off on the form but will refrain from signing the signatures page of the thesis until all conditions have been met UNLESS faculty will be traveling at the time of library submission in which case all but one (usually the advisor) Committee member may sign the signature pages. The last signature will be added when all revisions are completed.\nThe signatures of the Thesis Defense Committee members on the thesis signatures page will indicate final approval of the title, abstract and thesis.
