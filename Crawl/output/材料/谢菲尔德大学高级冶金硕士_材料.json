The module centres on the physical metallurgy of such engineering alloys to demonstrate the effect of alloying and implications for the processing, microstructure and performance of structural components in a range of industrial sectors, but predominantly the automotive and aerospace sectors.\n15 credits\n\n\nScience of Materials\n\n\nThis module introduces key concepts involved in materials science to cover general aspects and applications of metallic, polymeric and inorganic materials. Topics covered include: chemical bonding; basic crystallography of crystalline materials; crystal defects; mechanical properties and strength of materials; phase diagrams and transformations; overviews of metals and alloys; polymers and inorganic solids.\n15 credits\n\n\nMaterials Processing and Characterisation\n\n\nThis module introduces experimental methods used to characterise metals, polymers, ceramics and composites and the processes and technologies involved in the production of these materials. \n\nTopics covered are split into two areas:Characterisation: Analysis of materials using a range of techniques, e.g., diffraction, spectroscopy and thermal analysisProcessing: Manufacturing of materials and parts, e.g., powder, thermomechanical and moulding\n15 credits\n\n\nPractical, Modelling and Digital Skills\n\n\nThis module develops your skills in three linked areas: \n\n(a) materials characterisation laboratory skills including safe methods of working, completion of COSHH and risk assessments, and measurements using a range of practical techniques \n\n(b) the use of computers for data handling and analysis (MATLAB) together with an introduction to finite element modelling (FEM) using ANSYS.  \n\n (c) the skills needed to search for scientific literature as well as technical skills for presenting data, including how to avoid plagiarism, referencing, formatting documents, drawing high quality graphs, critically reviewing literature and giving presentations.\n15 credits\n\n\nMetallurgical Processing\n\n\nThis module examines three areas of materials engineering where significant improvement in performance in-service can be obtained via their use. First, the module provides an introduction to the processes and technologies involved in the production of steel. Secondly, methodologies of how microstructure can be significantly improved via thermomechanical processing are investigated and aims to build insight into the operation and capabilities of thermomechanical processing techniques. Finally, this module will describe in detail the underlying engineering principles of plastic forming and focus on some of the main metallic production techniques such as extrusion, rolling and wire drawing. \n15 credits\n\n\nDeformation, Fracture and Fatigue\n\n\nDeformation, fracture and fatigue are important mechanical phenomena in both metals processing and use. The role of dislocations in and the effects of microstructural features on the plastic deformation of metals is initially explored. Consideration of fracture starts with linear elastic fracture mechanics including the Griffith equation and Irwin stress intensity factors. The effects of plasticity effects on fracture in metals including plastic zones at crack tips and cyclical fatigue are considered in some detail. Both total lifetime approaches and damage tolerance approaches to fatigue are considered. \n15 credits\n\n\nAdvanced Materials Manufacturing\n\n\nThis unit introduces key concepts with regards to Materials 4.0, the fourth industrial revolution. Modelling and simulation is a key enabling technology within Aerospace Technology Institute's strategy to reach zero carbon emissions by 2050. Modelling allows for the rapid insertion of new materials and manufacturing processes, in addition to the improved understanding and optimisation of current methods. The course includes key drivers in reaching zero carbon emissions, covering lithium battery manufacturing and coating technologies.\n\nThis unit aims to provide knowledge and experience of advanced manufacturing techniques that will underpin the UK's future advanced materials manufacturing base and obtain knowledge and experience of advanced manufacturing process and material modelling to solve industrial problems.\n\n \n15 credits\n\n\nHeat and Materials with Application\n\n\nThis module presents the underlying theory of heat transfer and diffusion, covering the derivation and solution to important and frequently encountered engineering problems. Thus, conduction, convection and radiative heat transfer, on their own and in combination are considered, followed by an examination of diffusion (Fick's laws) and chemical thermodynamics.  The course introduces analytical solutions to diffusion and heat transfer problems considering a range of boundary conditions and geometry. Spectral methods are covered briefly, with a focus on numerical solutions obtained using the finite difference method. The course is assessed through an exam and coursework. The exam assesses the background knowledge of heat transfer and diffusion, in addition to the ability to apply analytical solutions to solve industrial problems. A coursework assignment builds upon this knowledge to explore problems involving more complex boundary conditions and more detailed descriptions of material properties using the finite difference method. \n15 credits\n\n\nProject\n\n\nStudents undertake a project on a topic agreed with their allocated academic supervisor; supervisor allocation takes into accounts students' specific interests. The project is an original research investigation carried out within a research group in the Department; to develop students' abilities to interact within a research group a defined piece of group work is undertaken early in the project. All projects include a literature survey involving students reading original papers and review articles from the scientific and technical literature. Most projects involve extensive laboratory work although some may be based primarily on a survey of the published literature or computational studies. The assessment of the project includes assessment of the group work, an interim report and final report along with a presentation on the work to staff and other students and an oral examination. Conduct throughout the project is also assessed.\n60 credits\nCore modules:\nThis module covers engineering metallic alloys ranging from alloy steels, stainless steels, light alloys (i.e. aluminium alloys and titanium alloys) and high temperature metallic systems (intermetallics and nickel superalloys).

Topics covered include: chemical bonding; basic crystallography of crystalline materials; crystal defects; mechanical properties and strength of materials; phase diagrams and transformations; overviews of metals and alloys; polymers and inorganic solids.\n15 credits\n\n\nMaterials Processing and Characterisation\n\n\nThis module introduces experimental methods used to characterise metals, polymers, ceramics and composites and the processes and technologies involved in the production of these materials. \n\nTopics covered are split into two areas:Characterisation: Analysis of materials using a range of techniques, e.g., diffraction, spectroscopy and thermal analysisProcessing: Manufacturing of materials and parts, e.g., powder, thermomechanical and moulding\n15 credits\n\n\nPractical, Modelling and Digital Skills\n\n\nThis module develops your skills in three linked areas: \n\n(a) materials characterisation laboratory skills including safe methods of working, completion of COSHH and risk assessments, and measurements using a range of practical techniques \n\n(b) the use of computers for data handling and analysis (MATLAB) together with an introduction to finite element modelling (FEM) using ANSYS.  \n\n (c) the skills needed to search for scientific literature as well as technical skills for presenting data, including how to avoid plagiarism, referencing, formatting documents, drawing high quality graphs, critically reviewing literature and giving presentations.\n15 credits\n\n\nMetallurgical Processing\n\n\nThis module examines three areas of materials engineering where significant improvement in performance in-service can be obtained via their use. First, the module provides an introduction to the processes and technologies involved in the production of steel. Secondly, methodologies of how microstructure can be significantly improved via thermomechanical processing are investigated and aims to build insight into the operation and capabilities of thermomechanical processing techniques. Finally, this module will describe in detail the underlying engineering principles of plastic forming and focus on some of the main metallic production techniques such as extrusion, rolling and wire drawing. \n15 credits\n\n\nDeformation, Fracture and Fatigue\n\n\nDeformation, fracture and fatigue are important mechanical phenomena in both metals processing and use. The role of dislocations in and the effects of microstructural features on the plastic deformation of metals is initially explored. Consideration of fracture starts with linear elastic fracture mechanics including the Griffith equation and Irwin stress intensity factors. The effects of plasticity effects on fracture in metals including plastic zones at crack tips and cyclical fatigue are considered in some detail. Both total lifetime approaches and damage tolerance approaches to fatigue are considered. \n15 credits\n\n\nAdvanced Materials Manufacturing\n\n\nThis unit introduces key concepts with regards to Materials 4.0, the fourth industrial revolution. Modelling and simulation is a key enabling technology within Aerospace Technology Institute's strategy to reach zero carbon emissions by 2050. Modelling allows for the rapid insertion of new materials and manufacturing processes, in addition to the improved understanding and optimisation of current methods. The course includes key drivers in reaching zero carbon emissions, covering lithium battery manufacturing and coating technologies.\n\nThis unit aims to provide knowledge and experience of advanced manufacturing techniques that will underpin the UK's future advanced materials manufacturing base and obtain knowledge and experience of advanced manufacturing process and material modelling to solve industrial problems.\n\n \n15 credits\n\n\nHeat and Materials with Application\n\n\nThis module presents the underlying theory of heat transfer and diffusion, covering the derivation and solution to important and frequently encountered engineering problems. Thus, conduction, convection and radiative heat transfer, on their own and in combination are considered, followed by an examination of diffusion (Fick's laws) and chemical thermodynamics.  The course introduces analytical solutions to diffusion and heat transfer problems considering a range of boundary conditions and geometry. Spectral methods are covered briefly, with a focus on numerical solutions obtained using the finite difference method. The course is assessed through an exam and coursework. The exam assesses the background knowledge of heat transfer and diffusion, in addition to the ability to apply analytical solutions to solve industrial problems. A coursework assignment builds upon this knowledge to explore problems involving more complex boundary conditions and more detailed descriptions of material properties using the finite difference method. \n15 credits\n\n\nProject\n\n\nStudents undertake a project on a topic agreed with their allocated academic supervisor; supervisor allocation takes into accounts students' specific interests. The project is an original research investigation carried out within a research group in the Department; to develop students' abilities to interact within a research group a defined piece of group work is undertaken early in the project. All projects include a literature survey involving students reading original papers and review articles from the scientific and technical literature. Most projects involve extensive laboratory work although some may be based primarily on a survey of the published literature or computational studies. The assessment of the project includes assessment of the group work, an interim report and final report along with a presentation on the work to staff and other students and an oral examination. Conduct throughout the project is also assessed.\n60 credits\n\n\n\n\n\nATAS applicants: copy module titles to clipboard\n\n\n\n\nThe content of our courses is reviewed annually to make sure it's up-to-date and relevant. Individual modules are occasionally updated or withdrawn. This is in response to discoveries through our world-leading research; funding changes; professional accreditation requirements; student or employer feedback; outcomes of reviews; and variations in staff or student numbers. In the event of any change we will inform students and take reasonable steps to minimise disruption.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Open days\n  \n\n\nInterested in postgraduate taught study?

The module centres on the physical metallurgy of such engineering alloys to demonstrate the effect of alloying and implications for the processing, microstructure and performance of structural components in a range of industrial sectors, but predominantly the automotive and aerospace sectors.\n15 credits\n\n\nScience of Materials\n\n\nThis module introduces key concepts involved in materials science to cover general aspects and applications of metallic, polymeric and inorganic materials. Topics covered include: chemical bonding; basic crystallography of crystalline materials; crystal defects; mechanical properties and strength of materials; phase diagrams and transformations; overviews of metals and alloys; polymers and inorganic solids.\n15 credits\n\n\nMaterials Processing and Characterisation\n\n\nThis module introduces experimental methods used to characterise metals, polymers, ceramics and composites and the processes and technologies involved in the production of these materials. \n\nTopics covered are split into two areas:Characterisation: Analysis of materials using a range of techniques, e.g., diffraction, spectroscopy and thermal analysisProcessing: Manufacturing of materials and parts, e.g., powder, thermomechanical and moulding\n15 credits\n\n\nPractical, Modelling and Digital Skills\n\n\nThis module develops your skills in three linked areas: \n\n(a) materials characterisation laboratory skills including safe methods of working, completion of COSHH and risk assessments, and measurements using a range of practical techniques \n\n(b) the use of computers for data handling and analysis (MATLAB) together with an introduction to finite element modelling (FEM) using ANSYS.  \n\n (c) the skills needed to search for scientific literature as well as technical skills for presenting data, including how to avoid plagiarism, referencing, formatting documents, drawing high quality graphs, critically reviewing literature and giving presentations.\n15 credits\n\n\nMetallurgical Processing\n\n\nThis module examines three areas of materials engineering where significant improvement in performance in-service can be obtained via their use. First, the module provides an introduction to the processes and technologies involved in the production of steel. Secondly, methodologies of how microstructure can be significantly improved via thermomechanical processing are investigated and aims to build insight into the operation and capabilities of thermomechanical processing techniques. Finally, this module will describe in detail the underlying engineering principles of plastic forming and focus on some of the main metallic production techniques such as extrusion, rolling and wire drawing. \n15 credits\n\n\nDeformation, Fracture and Fatigue\n\n\nDeformation, fracture and fatigue are important mechanical phenomena in both metals processing and use. The role of dislocations in and the effects of microstructural features on the plastic deformation of metals is initially explored. Consideration of fracture starts with linear elastic fracture mechanics including the Griffith equation and Irwin stress intensity factors. The effects of plasticity effects on fracture in metals including plastic zones at crack tips and cyclical fatigue are considered in some detail. Both total lifetime approaches and damage tolerance approaches to fatigue are considered. \n15 credits\n\n\nAdvanced Materials Manufacturing\n\n\nThis unit introduces key concepts with regards to Materials 4.0, the fourth industrial revolution. Modelling and simulation is a key enabling technology within Aerospace Technology Institute's strategy to reach zero carbon emissions by 2050. Modelling allows for the rapid insertion of new materials and manufacturing processes, in addition to the improved understanding and optimisation of current methods. The course includes key drivers in reaching zero carbon emissions, covering lithium battery manufacturing and coating technologies.\n\nThis unit aims to provide knowledge and experience of advanced manufacturing techniques that will underpin the UK's future advanced materials manufacturing base and obtain knowledge and experience of advanced manufacturing process and material modelling to solve industrial problems.\n\n \n15 credits\n\n\nHeat and Materials with Application\n\n\nThis module presents the underlying theory of heat transfer and diffusion, covering the derivation and solution to important and frequently encountered engineering problems. Thus, conduction, convection and radiative heat transfer, on their own and in combination are considered, followed by an examination of diffusion (Fick's laws) and chemical thermodynamics.  The course introduces analytical solutions to diffusion and heat transfer problems considering a range of boundary conditions and geometry. Spectral methods are covered briefly, with a focus on numerical solutions obtained using the finite difference method. The course is assessed through an exam and coursework. The exam assesses the background knowledge of heat transfer and diffusion, in addition to the ability to apply analytical solutions to solve industrial problems. A coursework assignment builds upon this knowledge to explore problems involving more complex boundary conditions and more detailed descriptions of material properties using the finite difference method. \n15 credits\n\n\nProject\n\n\nStudents undertake a project on a topic agreed with their allocated academic supervisor; supervisor allocation takes into accounts students' specific interests. The project is an original research investigation carried out within a research group in the Department; to develop students' abilities to interact within a research group a defined piece of group work is undertaken early in the project. All projects include a literature survey involving students reading original papers and review articles from the scientific and technical literature. Most projects involve extensive laboratory work although some may be based primarily on a survey of the published literature or computational studies. The assessment of the project includes assessment of the group work, an interim report and final report along with a presentation on the work to staff and other students and an oral examination. Conduct throughout the project is also assessed.\n60 credits\n\n\n\n\n\nATAS applicants: copy module titles to clipboard\n\n\n\n\nThe content of our courses is reviewed annually to make sure it's up-to-date and relevant. Individual modules are occasionally updated or withdrawn. This is in response to discoveries through our world-leading research; funding changes; professional accreditation requirements; student or employer feedback; outcomes of reviews; and variations in staff or student numbers.

The course includes key drivers in reaching zero carbon emissions, covering lithium battery manufacturing and coating technologies.\n\nThis unit aims to provide knowledge and experience of advanced manufacturing techniques that will underpin the UK's future advanced materials manufacturing base and obtain knowledge and experience of advanced manufacturing process and material modelling to solve industrial problems.\n\n \n15 credits\n\n\nHeat and Materials with Application\n\n\nThis module presents the underlying theory of heat transfer and diffusion, covering the derivation and solution to important and frequently encountered engineering problems. Thus, conduction, convection and radiative heat transfer, on their own and in combination are considered, followed by an examination of diffusion (Fick's laws) and chemical thermodynamics.  The course introduces analytical solutions to diffusion and heat transfer problems considering a range of boundary conditions and geometry. Spectral methods are covered briefly, with a focus on numerical solutions obtained using the finite difference method. The course is assessed through an exam and coursework. The exam assesses the background knowledge of heat transfer and diffusion, in addition to the ability to apply analytical solutions to solve industrial problems. A coursework assignment builds upon this knowledge to explore problems involving more complex boundary conditions and more detailed descriptions of material properties using the finite difference method. \n15 credits\n\n\nProject\n\n\nStudents undertake a project on a topic agreed with their allocated academic supervisor; supervisor allocation takes into accounts students' specific interests. The project is an original research investigation carried out within a research group in the Department; to develop students' abilities to interact within a research group a defined piece of group work is undertaken early in the project. All projects include a literature survey involving students reading original papers and review articles from the scientific and technical literature. Most projects involve extensive laboratory work although some may be based primarily on a survey of the published literature or computational studies. The assessment of the project includes assessment of the group work, an interim report and final report along with a presentation on the work to staff and other students and an oral examination.

The module centres on the physical metallurgy of such engineering alloys to demonstrate the effect of alloying and implications for the processing, microstructure and performance of structural components in a range of industrial sectors, but predominantly the automotive and aerospace sectors.\n15 credits\n\n\nScience of Materials\n\n\nThis module introduces key concepts involved in materials science to cover general aspects and applications of metallic, polymeric and inorganic materials. Topics covered include: chemical bonding; basic crystallography of crystalline materials; crystal defects; mechanical properties and strength of materials; phase diagrams and transformations; overviews of metals and alloys; polymers and inorganic solids.\n15 credits\n\n\nMaterials Processing and Characterisation\n\n\nThis module introduces experimental methods used to characterise metals, polymers, ceramics and composites and the processes and technologies involved in the production of these materials. \n\nTopics covered are split into two areas:Characterisation: Analysis of materials using a range of techniques, e.g., diffraction, spectroscopy and thermal analysisProcessing: Manufacturing of materials and parts, e.g., powder, thermomechanical and moulding\n15 credits\n\n\nPractical, Modelling and Digital Skills\n\n\nThis module develops your skills in three linked areas: \n\n(a) materials characterisation laboratory skills including safe methods of working, completion of COSHH and risk assessments, and measurements using a range of practical techniques \n\n(b) the use of computers for data handling and analysis (MATLAB) together with an introduction to finite element modelling (FEM) using ANSYS.  \n\n (c) the skills needed to search for scientific literature as well as technical skills for presenting data, including how to avoid plagiarism, referencing, formatting documents, drawing high quality graphs, critically reviewing literature and giving presentations.\n15 credits\n\n\nMetallurgical Processing\n\n\nThis module examines three areas of materials engineering where significant improvement in performance in-service can be obtained via their use. First, the module provides an introduction to the processes and technologies involved in the production of steel. Secondly, methodologies of how microstructure can be significantly improved via thermomechanical processing are investigated and aims to build insight into the operation and capabilities of thermomechanical processing techniques. Finally, this module will describe in detail the underlying engineering principles of plastic forming and focus on some of the main metallic production techniques such as extrusion, rolling and wire drawing. \n15 credits\n\n\nDeformation, Fracture and Fatigue\n\n\nDeformation, fracture and fatigue are important mechanical phenomena in both metals processing and use. The role of dislocations in and the effects of microstructural features on the plastic deformation of metals is initially explored. Consideration of fracture starts with linear elastic fracture mechanics including the Griffith equation and Irwin stress intensity factors. The effects of plasticity effects on fracture in metals including plastic zones at crack tips and cyclical fatigue are considered in some detail. Both total lifetime approaches and damage tolerance approaches to fatigue are considered. \n15 credits\n\n\nAdvanced Materials Manufacturing\n\n\nThis unit introduces key concepts with regards to Materials 4.0, the fourth industrial revolution. Modelling and simulation is a key enabling technology within Aerospace Technology Institute's strategy to reach zero carbon emissions by 2050.

The Department of Materials, Science and Engineering is one the best ranked in the UK based on academic and research performance, student satisfaction and graduate prospects. All these features turn Sheffield into more than an attractive option to choose to gain in-depth and up-dated knowledge in metallurgical engineering.\nWhy did you choose to study your chosen degree?\nSince I obtained my college degree in Chemical Engineering, I have been working for the past ten years in an international steel company, Ternium. To develop my professional profile I applied to study MMet Advance Metallurgy -  understanding it as a strategic step in my long-term career.\nWhat do you enjoy most about your course?\nIn my opinion, the most valuable aspect of the course is the solid professors’ academic profile. The modules are designed to cover the fundamentals but also contain the latest developments and trends in each field. This is justified by the key role the department plays in the terms of research and technological advances within the material engineering sector’s needs and challenges.

Many of the city’s strolls are connected to well-marked footpaths in the Peak District National Park, one the largest in the UK, which Sheffield lies on. This lets you discover and enjoy wonderful landscapes in the countryside just a few minutes away on foot from your residence.      \nDo you have any tips for someone thinking of doing an MSc in the Department of Materials Science & Engineering.\nI would suggest taking advantage of every available learning opportunity to build up a solid technical profile that will certainly provide access to further career prospects. As a completely interdisciplinary department, Materials Science is a key stakeholder in the troubleshooting of current and upcoming engineering challenges. Getting involved in an active role will grant useful knowledge, tools and skills to succeed at university and after graduating indeed.\nFind a postgraduate course\nA masters from Sheffield means in-depth knowledge, advanced skills and the confidence to achieve your ambitions. \n\nCourse search and A-Z\n[GRID_TABLE]\nThis degree is certainly strengthening and developing not only my technical profile but also my personal skills as an overseas student.\nMaria Dutto\n    \n    \n    \n\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n                  MSc student\n    \n    \n    \n\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n                  MMet Advanced Metallurgy \n    \n    \n    \n\n\nMaria is studying Advanced Metallurgy MMet. Before starting the course Maria had been working in industry for 10 years and felt this course would be a strategic step in her long-term career. \n\n\n\nWhy did you choose to study at Sheffield?\nThe University of Sheffield is a world-class institution that has played a key role in materials innovations over the past century, particularly in steel developments, my main area of interest and expertise. The Department of Materials, Science and Engineering is one the best ranked in the UK based on academic and research performance, student satisfaction and graduate prospects. All these features turn Sheffield into more than an attractive option to choose to gain in-depth and up-dated knowledge in metallurgical engineering.  \nWhy did you choose to study your chosen degree?\nSince I obtained my college degree in Chemical Engineering, I have been working for the past ten years in an international steel company, Ternium. To develop my professional profile I applied to study MMet Advance Metallurgy -  understanding it as a strategic step in my long-term career. \nWhat do you enjoy most about your course?\nIn my opinion, the most valuable aspect of the course is the solid professors’ academic profile. The modules are designed to cover the fundamentals but also contain the latest developments and trends in each field. This is justified by the key role the department plays in the terms of research and technological advances within the material engineering sector’s needs and challenges. Secondly, the variety of learning resources and facilities is delightful. The different kinds of studying spaces available across the campus, the technical offer of the libraries and the engineering laboratories accompany and encourage the daily studying experience.\nDo you have any plans for after you graduate?\nBefore attending the course and after occupying different positions within Ternium’s Argentina steel shop, I worked for the last three years as Operations Manager of the Secondary Steelmaking area. The job involved managing the staff I was in charge of and all the equipment involved in the production line in order to achieve the production, quality, safety and environmental aims with a continuous focus on improving our performance standards.  \nThis degree is certainly strengthening and developing not only my technical profile but also my personal skills as an overseas student. Having the opportunity of being part of an international community allows improving your communication, cultural and self-awareness skills, gaining a broader perspective through a different learning approach in terms of academic, social and industrial concerns.\nUniversity isn't just about academic studies.

The offer letter will be attached to our email and also available for you to download from your online application.If we haven't offered you a study place and you would like feedback on this decision, you should contact the academic department directly in writing.Offer typesIf we make you an offer, it will be either Conditional or Unconditional.A Conditional offer means there are requirements that you need to meet before you can start the course, for example a certain English language score, or a minimum grade in your current studies.An Unconditional offer means there are no further academic requirements that you need to meet.Conditional offersIf we've made you a Conditional offer, the conditions will be stated in your offer letter. When you've met these conditions, you should upload to your online application documents that prove it. When you've met all the conditions of your offer, we'll provide you with a new, Unconditional offer letter.The standard deadlines for meeting the conditions of an offer are provided on our key dates and deadlines page.If you have any problems attaching documents to your online application, please contact us.Calculating average final marks for International studentsWe normally determine the final mark of an international degree by calculating the average of all the module marks, weighted by credit value. For module marks assigned as a range, we use the mid-point of the range. Note that the average we calculate may differ from the average shown on your transcript.Unconditional offersAn Unconditional offer has no conditions. You just need to let us know whether or not you want to accept or decline our offer of a study place.Replying to your offerIn most cases, you can accept or decline the offer of a study place via your online application. If you're not able to do this, please let us know your decision by emailing us at admissions@sheffield.ac.uk. When you accept an offer, you also accept our Terms and Conditions upon Acceptance of an Offer.Except where indicated in the offer letter, there are no specific deadlines for accepting an offer. However, we encourage applicants to make a decision within three months of receiving an offer. Also, the sooner you accept an offer, the sooner you'll be able to make other arrangements (for example your accommodation or visa).You can accept only one Unconditional offer of a place. If you've received Unconditional offers for more than one course, you'll need to choose which course to accept. You should then decline the other offers.Withdrawing your applicationIf you want to withdraw from the application process, please contact us. We'll then update your application record.DeferralsIf we've offered you a study place and for unforeseen circumstances you can't attend at the start of your course, you can ask to defer your entry.You can request a deferral through your original online application, by clicking on the 'Request Deferral' link in the 'Your Applications' section. Your request will be forwarded to the academic selectors for a decision. A change of start date is at the discretion of the University. It isn't automatically given and you may be asked to make a new application.If the academic selectors approve your request, we'll send you an amended offer letter with a deferred start date.You should submit your deferral request by the deadline published on our key dates webpage. You can defer your application a maximum of two times. If want to defer for a third time, we'll ask you to re-apply.Further information sent by the UniversityYour MUSE accountUniversity of Sheffield offer-holders are entitled to access the members area of our website, MUSE (My University of Sheffield Environment).

You may wish to add admissions@sheffield.ac.uk to your address book to avoid important messages being marked as spam.\nIf you change your email address, please let us know by emailing us at admissions@sheffield.ac.uk, including your full name and applicant number.\nFor most taught courses, it normally takes academic departments around four weeks to make decisions on applications. It can take longer at busy times.\nFor some of our courses, we may invite you to attend an interview with staff from your academic department. You can find information on what to expect in an interview in our guidance:\nWhen we've made our decision, it will appear in your online application, and we'll also send you an email to confirm this.\nIf we've offered you a study place, we'll provide you with an official electronic offer letter detailing any conditions and the amount payable for the tuition fees. The offer letter will be attached to our email and also available for you to download from your online application.\nIf we haven't offered you a study place and you would like feedback on this decision, you should contact the academic department directly in writing. You can find their contact details under the relevant entry in our postgraduate taught course listings.\nIf we make you an offer, it will be either Conditional or Unconditional.\nA Conditional offer means that there are requirements that you need to meet before you can start the course, for example a certain English language score, or a minimum grade in your current studies.\nAn Unconditional offer means that there are no further academic requirements that you need to meet.\nIf we've made you a Conditional offer, the conditions will be stated in your offer letter. When you've met these conditions, you should upload to your online application documents that prove it. When you've met all the conditions of your offer, we'll provide you with a new, Unconditional offer letter.\nThe standard deadlines for meeting the conditions of your offer are provided on our key dates and deadlines page. A few courses use different deadlines. If this is the case for your course, it will be indicated in your offer letter.\nIf you have any problems attaching documents to your online application, please contact us.\nWe normally determine the final mark of an international degree by calculating the average of all the module marks, weighted by credit value. For module marks assigned as a range, we use the mid-point of the range. Note that the average we calculate may differ from the average shown on your transcript.\nAn Unconditional offer has no conditions. You just need to let us know whether or not you want to accept or decline our offer of a study place.\nIn most cases, you can accept or decline the offer of a study place via your online application. If you're not able to do this, please let us know your decision by emailing us at admissions@sheffield.ac.uk. When you accept an offer, you also accept our Terms and Conditions upon Acceptance of an Offer.\nExcept where indicated in the offer letter, there are no specific deadlines for accepting an offer. However, we encourage applicants to make a decision within three months of receiving an offer. Also, the sooner you accept an offer, the sooner you'll be able to make other arrangements (for example your accommodation or visa).\nYou can accept only one Unconditional offer of a place. If you've received Unconditional offers for more than one course, you'll need to choose which course to accept. You should then decline the other offers.\nIf you're an International applicant, we'll normally ask you to pay a deposit on your tuition fee after you accept an Unconditional offer. We'll tell you more about this, including how you can pay, in your Unconditional offer letter.\nTuition fee deposits\nIf you want to withdraw from the application process, please contact us. We'll then update your application record.\nIf we've offered you a study place and you will be unable to attend at the start of your course, you may be able to defer your entry to the next admission point. Most postgraduate taught courses have one admission per year, at the start of the autumn semester in September/October.\nFor most courses, you can request a deferral through your original online application by clicking on the 'Request Deferral' link in the 'Your Applications' section. Requesting a deferral will deactivate your current offer, so you should only request one when you're sure that you can't start on the original start date. If you aren't sure, we would advise you to submit a new application for the next admission point, when applications open for that year.\nIf the academic selectors approve your request, we'll send you an amended offer letter with a deferred start date.\nYou should submit your deferral request by the deadline published on our key dates webpage. You can defer your application a maximum of two times. If want to defer for a third time, we'll ask you to re-apply.\nDeferral requests are reviewed by our admissions selectors, then we'll let you know the decision. Please note that we can't always review deferral requests when we receive them, and we can't issue deferred offers until after the new admissions year has begun, usually in September. We'll acknowledge receipt of your request within two weeks.\nUniversity of Sheffield offer-holders are entitled to access the members area of our website, MUSE (My University of Sheffield Environment). Using MUSE is the easiest way to book to attend departmental open days, apply for University accommodation and scholarships and, when the time comes, complete pre-registration tasks.\nAfter we've issued your offer, we'll email you with a username and invite you to activate your account. More information is available on our webpages:\nMUSE for offer-holders\nWhen you have accepted your Conditional or Unconditional offer, you can apply online for University accommodation.
