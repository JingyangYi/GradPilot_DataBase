Upon successful completion of the Top Master Programme in\nNanoscience, the student will be in an excellent position for a\ncareer in research in nanoscience and nanotechnology.\n95% of the Top Master Nanoscience\ngraduates continue their career in a PhD position at the Zernike\nInstitute for Advanced Materials National Research Centre or\nelsewhere.\nThe Top Master's degree programme in Nanoscience is closely\nlinked to the Zernike Institute for Advanced Materials, a leading\ninternational research centre, ranked amongst the top 20 of the\nworld.\nZernike Institute\nfor Advanced Materials\nThe Institute's mission is the design and scientific study of\nmaterials for functionality. It aims to maintain its position as an\ninternationally recognised, leading, materials research and\ntraining institute. As an institute, it conducts research that is\naddressing fundamental questions in the fields of functional\nmaterials. In this way, it wants to optimise the synergy and\nknowledge transfer between the sub-disciplines of physics,\nchemistry and (with less weight) biology. Also, the Institute\neducates a new generation of researchers in a cross-disciplinary\napproach to better prepare the graduates for the diversity and\nquality of skills needed in society.\nResearch at the Zernike Institute for Advanced\nMaterials\nBasic research on materials is directed towards unravelling the\nrelations between the properties that determine their functionality\nand their chemical composition and structure. The quest for\nin-depth understanding of these constitutive relations often leads\nto unexpected boundaries signifying fundamental gaps in our\nknowledge. Although the structure-property relationship is in\nitself a truism, the actual linkage between (micro) structural\naspects in a material and its physical/chemical properties is\nelusive. The reason is that various properties are determined by\nthe collective behaviour of molecules, atoms and electrons and\ntheir behaviour may be extremely non-linear on different time and\nlength scales.\nThe classic materials triangle concerns an integrative approach\nin the three aspects of structure, property and chemical\ncomposition. The Zernike Institute for Advanced Materials adds an\nextra dimension to this traditional view by an unconventional\nlinkage to the field of biomolecular sciences, which includes the\ndesign aspects as well.\nAfter I obtained my\nBachelor’s degree in Mexico City, I chose to study the MSc\nprogramme Nanoscience at the University of Groningen. I was drawn\nto this field because it encompasses a wide range of disciplines,\nincluding Physics, Chemistry, and a touch of Biology, creating a\nmultidisciplinary environment. My professor at the time had\nconnections with my current supervisor, and the university really\nspoke to me. That’s how I ended up in Groningen!\nThe programme is\nheavily research-oriented and certainly not easy, but in the end,\nit’s worth it since you gain so much knowledge in a short\nperiod of time. I particularly enjoyed the second year, because you\nare free in deciding your own research subject for the master\nthesis and you really have the time to dive deeper into the\nsubject.\nCurrently, I am a\nPhD student in the Palasantzas group at the Zernike Institute. My\nresearch is about the Casimir effect in topological materials. So\nfar, I really like the PhD position. It involves regular\ninteraction with fellow PhD students and research groups, providing\ncontinuous opportunities for mutual learning.\nAlso, I feel that\nthe programme prepared me well for this PhD position. Because all\nour teachers were professors associated with the Zernike Institute,\nyou learn from the experts. The contact with my teachers was\nexcellent; they were always willing to answer every one of my\nquestions. This definitely had a positive effect on my\nresearch.\nMy advice to\nprospective Nanoscience students is: when you do the small project\nand assignments during the program, choose different subjects and\nprofessors! This will enable you to connect with various\nindividuals, broaden your network, and gain a comprehensive\nunderstanding of the research field. There's much to learn from one\nanother in this multidisciplinary setting.\nAs for my future\nplans, I can envision myself as a professor. While certain aspects\nof the journey don't fully speak to me, I have a huge passion for\nteaching. All in all, I will see where the future brings\nme!\nI\npursued my BSc studies in Physics at the University of Groningen.\nAfter that, I chose the MSc Nanoscience because this programme\nentails fascinating topics that combine physics as well as\nchemistry.\nThe programme\naligned well with my expectations. One of the highlights of the\nprogramme was the integration into research groups. This gave me\nvaluable exposure to potential thesis topics and research areas.\nThe programme included a small research project in the first year\nand a thesis in the second year. Besides these projects I gained\nmore knowledge by following courses and gained hands-on experience\nin the lab.\nAfter graduation I\nstarted working at QDI Systems, a high-tech start-up, spin-off from\nZernike Institute for Advanced Materials (ZIAM), founded by a\nformer PhD researcher from the same research group where I\ncompleted my master's thesis. My transition to this industry role\nwas influenced by my desire to explore career opportunities beyond\nacademia, given the high workload associated with pursuing a\nPh.D.\nThe goal of QDI\nSystems is to achieve higher resolution in medical imaging. The\ncompany specializes in depositing quantum strips on various sensors\nfor applications in e.g. infrared detection, X-ray imaging, and\nmammography. My role primarily involves device fabrication and\ncharacterization, extracting valuable insights from data, and\nformulating next steps. The skills and knowledge I gained during\nthe master's programme in Nanoscience have been useful in my work\nhere, as many of the techniques and methodologies we employ were\nintroduced during my academic studies.\nFor future\nNanoscience students, I would advise taking the time to explore the\nvarious research groups connected to the programme. Being proactive\nand not waiting for opportunities to come to you is crucial. In my\ncase, choosing the Nanoscience master's programme turned out to be\nan excellent decision that aligned perfectly with my current job\nand career aspirations.\nI have a Bachelor’s degree in Chemistry with a focus on\nmaterials science. I have always been interested in the interface\nbetween chemistry and physics, which is why I chose the\nMaster’s degree programme in Nanoscience. It was good to be\nable to gain some physics knowledge through the guided self-study\nat the beginning of the year, since my Bachelor’s programme\ndid not address this as much. It is hard work but since the groups\nare small, you can really help each other. We spend a lot of time\nin the nano rooms, where you can work together or have a chat on\ncampus. We also organised the Nanosymposium, which students\norganise annually.\nYou are given a lot of freedom in the research projects. I am\ndoing a research project about STED microscopy: a microscope that\ncan look at things at the nanoscale. I am researching whether these\nlasers can be used on living cells. This project applies my\nknowledge of both biology and physics. After my studies, I would\nlike to do research at the University or at a company. The study\ngives you the tools to do a PhD because you have a lot of contact\nwith the lecturers and interdisciplinary research groups. Working\nin research groups with different disciplines gives me a lot of\nenergy.\nWith a bachelor's degree in Applied Physics, I joined the\nNanoscience Top Master programme in 2012. I found the\ninterdisciplinary nature of this programme the most appealing, as I\nwas interested in gathering expertise on areas in chemistry,\nphysics and biology.\nDuring the Top Master, I have attended several advanced\nchemistry courses, did my thesis project on single-molecule studies\nof DNA-based processes and did my Small Research Project on the\nsynthesis and characterization of organic-inorganic hybrid\nmaterials. As part of the curriculum, I wrote a research proposal\nbased on my experience during the Small Research Project, which got\nfunded and led to my current PhD position.\n\nI believe that the programme and the direct link to ongoing\nresearch in the Zernike Institute for Advanced Materials prepared\nme very well for my PhD. The Top Master programme allowed me to\nevolve from a student with a physics background into a researcher\nin the field of materials chemistry. Being able to work at the\nborder between physics and chemistry, I find myself in a position\nwhere I feel that I can make significant contributions to science.\nBeing able to make and characterize materials, gives me the tools I\nneed to develop my career. In addition, I think that the strength\nof the Nanoscience programme goes beyond the cross-disciplinary\nnature of the curriculum. Having a small cohort of students\n(maximum of 15), significantly adds to the learning process.\nWorking with people who do not only have different scientific\nbackgrounds (physics, chemistry or materials science), but also\ndifferent cultural backgrounds, was the highlight of my Master's\nprogramme and has taught me a lot.\n\nAs part of the curriculum, I wrote a research proposal based on my\nexperience during the Small Research Project, which got funded and\nled to my current PhD position.

Working with people who do not only have\ndifferent scientific backgrounds (physics, chemistry or materials\nscience), but also different cultural backgrounds, was the\nhighlight of my Master's programme and has taught me a lot.\nI decided to study Nanoscience because I believe nanoscience is\na very challenging and 'hot' topic; it really is the future of\nphysics. I was attracted by the integration of chemistry and\nphysics in the programme. The design of the modules seemed very\npromising. Also, I had some friends in Holland already.\nThe programme is very broad. It really gives you an overview of\nthe relevant parts of chemistry and physics. On the other hand, I\nsometimes wish we had more time to go into even more depth. I guess\nthat will have to wait until my PhD programme. Another strong point\nis that it really feels like a family. The lecturers treat you as\ncolleagues rather than as students, and we students form a\nclose-knit community. What also makes the programme attractive is\nthat it is nice to have so many foreign lecturers in the programme,\nas role models. If I could do it all over again, I would definitely\nselect nanoscience and come to Groningen again.\n• Sign\nup for our Master's Week\n• Subscribe to our monthly\nnewsletter\n• Working together with world-class scientists: Top researchers\nfrom Zernike Institute for Advanced Materials National Research\nCentre provide education in the courses and supervision in four\nindividual projects.

      "content": "[HEADING] Introduction to Top Master Programme in Nanoscience\n[HEADING] Testimonials\n[HEADING] More information\n[HEADING] Testimonials\n[HEADING] More information\nThe Zernike Institute for Advanced Materials (Zernike Institute) is responsible for the Top Master Programme in Nanoscience. This is a two-year international English-language Master's degree, open to motivated students with a Bachelor's degree in physics, chemistry, or materials science. The programme is composed of 120 ECTS of study elements. We aim to admit a diverse group of students, at least 60% of them from abroad. A leaflet with information about the programme is available.\nThe mission of the programme in Nanoscience is to educate and train future PhD-students who have the drive to perform cutting-edge research in a highly interdisciplinary field of research, excel in critical thinking and collaborate with their peers to reach out for a larger goal in research. This is achieved using the advantages of a small, selective programme with students, teachers, and research groups in close contact. This allows for intensive and efficient interaction, with plenty of hands-on experiments in the lab. Teachers and supervisors associated with the programme represent the excellent research groups taking part in the research programme of the Zernike Institute for Advanced Materials. Students are submitted to a challenging and highly demanding curriculum, combining both the broadness and depth necessary for a successful research career in the interdisciplinary field of nanoscience.\nStudents are pre-selected on the basis of academic potential and results in their Bachelor's phase, supported by a letter of application explaining their motivation, a list of accomplishments, and letters of recommendation. Pre-selected students will normally be invited for an interview in Groningen. Dutch students are eligble for DUO studiefinanciering as are EU students under certain conditions.\nThe Zernike Institute is very successful in helping all students who complete the program secure a PhD position at the Zernike Institute for Advanced Materials or other high-profile research institutes in the world. On average, 95% of the students graduating continue their PhD either in Groningen or abroad. A PhD in The Netherlands takes typically four years after the Master's degree has been obtained. Upon successful completion of the Top Master Programme in Nanoscience, the student will be in an excellent position for a career in research in nanoscience and nanotechnology.\nScholarships were kindly sponsored by the Zernike Institute for Advanced Materials and Cognigron for cohorts starting in 2024 or before.\nTian Liu (cohort 2015-2017): \"The small size of the class offered us very easy access to ask professors directly when we had any doubt during classes. The professors get interrupted during class very freqently but they can still finish their teaching contents according to their schedule. The best point of the master project was that I felt like I was treated as a colleague at the Zernike Institute instead of a master student. I really appreciated this kind of feeling.\"\nMore information about Tian on LinkedIn\nAtreya Majumdar (cohort 2017-2019): \"Coming from a pure physics background, the interdisciplinary nature of the Nanoscience programme impressed me, and that motivated me to apply for this very prestigious master’s programme. The very first stint was a guided study in Chemistry, that prepared us for the more chemistry-inclined topics of the core modules. What followed this was an intense period called the core modules, which was an intellectually stimulating and enjoyable journey where we got to learn basic concepts in Nanoscience. The topics taught us the physics, chemistry and even biology required to study different sorts of nanoscopic systems. Different modules posed different types of challenges to us and it was fascinating overcoming them. After this period we wrote a review article on a topic of our choice which I chose to do on nanoionic systems with applications in neuromorphic systems. Alongside that, we pursued a small research project which I did on the simulation of molecular motors. Both writing the article and doing the project involved an understanding of concepts both from physics and chemistry, which I had already acquired from the core modules. The final year is spent mostly on the masters’ research project which I did on interface-driven memristors. This project involved hands-on fabrication of nanodevices, electrical measurements and computer simulations of charge transport. The training I got before was instrumental in the success of this project. Although this whole journey was quite intense- I learned a lot, met people from different backgrounds and had my first serious experience with cutting-edge research. Now, I feel well-equipped to start my PhD project.\"\nMore information about Atreya on LinkedIn\nMachteld Kamminga (cohort 2012-2014): \"With a bachelor’s degree in Applied Physics, I joined the Nanoscience Top Master programme in 2012. I found the interdisciplinary nature of this programme the most appealing, as I was interested in gathering expertise on areas in chemistry, physics and biology. During the Top Master, I have attended several advanced chemistry courses, did my thesis project on single-molecule studies of DNA-based processes and did my Small Research project on the synthesis and characterization of organic-inorganic hybrid materials. As part of the curriculum, I wrote a research proposal based on my experience during the Small Research project, which got funded and led to my current PhD position. I believe that the programme and the direct link to ongoing research in the Zernike Institute for Advanced Materials prepared me very well for my PhD. The Top Master programme allowed me to evolve from a student with a physics background into a researcher in the field of materials chemistry. Being able to work at the border between physics and chemistry, I find myself in a position where I feel that I can make significant contributions to science. Being able to make and characterize materials, gives me the tools I need to develop my career. In addition, I think that the strength of the Nanoscience programme goes beyond the cross-disciplinary nature of the curriculum. Having a small cohort of students (aim of 15), significantly adds to the learning process. Working with people who do not only have different scientific backgrounds (physics, chemistry or materials science), but also different cultural backgrounds, was the highlight of my master’s programme and has taught me a lot.\"\nMore information about Machteld on LinkedIn\n• Rules for obtaining a PhD-position from the Zernike Institute for Advanced Materials are in charge, upon obtaining the MSc degree.\n• Rules for obtaining the epithets Cum laude and Summa cum laude on the Master of Science diploma.\n• Application and admission\n• Curriculum outline\n• Students in the programme\n• Follow us on Twitter, Instagram, and/or Facebook\n• Introduction video on YouTube\n[HTML_TABLE]\nLast modified: | 20 November 2024 3.12 p.m.\n[CARD]\nIntroduction to Top Master Programme in Nanoscience\n[CARD]\nFunctional\nFunctional\n\n                                Provides basic functions and uses anonymized cookies.\n[CARD]\nFunctional\nProvides basic functions and uses anonymized cookies.\n[CARD]\nFunctional\n[CARD]\nProvides basic functions and uses anonymized cookies.\n[CARD]\nStandard\nStandard\n\n                                Provides optimal operation and uses video cookies, among others.\n[CARD]\nStandard\nProvides optimal operation and uses video cookies, among others.\n[CARD]\nStandard\n[CARD]\nProvides optimal operation and uses video cookies, among others.\n[CARD]\nComplete\nComplete\n\n                                Provides personalized content and uses marketing cookies.\n[CARD]\nComplete\nProvides personalized content and uses marketing cookies.\n[CARD]\nComplete\n[CARD]\nProvides personalized content and uses marketing cookies.",
