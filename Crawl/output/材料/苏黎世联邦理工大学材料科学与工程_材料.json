With the rapid progress of technology and the consequent societal challenges, the demands placed on materials are constantly increasing. The development of sustainable materials and processes, more efficient materials for electronics, biocompatible implants, materials for energy storage or 3D-printed structures are some of the challenges that materials scientists are facing today.\nIn contrast to the structured curriculum of the Bachelor's degree programme, students can design the Master's degree programme in Materials according to their personal interests. In addition to a limited number of core courses, students can choose elective courses from the entire range of courses offered by ETH Zurich. An 8-week research project and an independently conducted 6-month Master's thesis, as well as a 12-week industrial internship provide in-depth insight into a wide range of topics in research and development.\nAfter completing their studies, materials scientists are able to perform research on a broad range of fundamental and applied scientific problems, develop novel engineering applications and analytical techniques, create new materials for more powerful products, manage projects, and lead interdisciplinary teams.\nThe Master's programme is open to students with an engineering or a scientific degree that includes a background in materials science.\n120 ECTS | 2 years\nMaster of Science ETH in Materials Science and Engineering\nDownload MSc Materials Science and Engineering (PDF, 158 KB)\nMaster’s degree programme in Materials Science\nETH Zurich\n                    Department of Materials\n                    Leopold-Ruzicka-Weg 4\n                HCP F 33.1\n                8093 \n                Zurich\n            Switzerland\n• Homepage\n• Navigation\n• Search\n• Content\n• Footer\n• Contact\n• Sitemap\n• Materials Science and Engineering\n• Further natural science or engineering degrees with broad fundamentals in materials science\n• Phone\n                        +41 44 632 25 20\n[CARD]\nContact\nDr. Sara Morgenthaler Kobas\n\n\n\nPhone\n                        +41 44 632 25 20\n\n\n\n\n\n            ETH Zurich\n                    Department of Materials\n                    Leopold-Ruzicka-Weg 4\n                HCP F 33.1\n                8093 \n                Zurich\n            Switzerland\n\n\n\n\n\n              Show more\n\n              Show less\n[CARD]\nContact\n[CARD]\nDr. Sara Morgenthaler Kobas\n\n\n\nPhone\n                        +41 44 632 25 20\n\n\n\n\n\n            ETH Zurich\n                    Department of Materials\n                    Leopold-Ruzicka-Weg 4\n                HCP F 33.1\n                8093 \n                Zurich\n            Switzerland\n\n\n\n\n\n              Show more\n\n              Show less\n[CARD]\nDr. Sara Morgenthaler Kobas\n[CARD]\nPhone\n                        +41 44 632 25 20\n[CARD]\nETH Zurich\n                    Department of Materials\n                    Leopold-Ruzicka-Weg 4\n                HCP F 33.1\n                8093 \n                Zurich\n            Switzerland\n[CARD]\nShow more\n\n              Show less",

      "content": "[HEADING] Master Programme\n[HEADING] Structure of the Master's Degree Course\n[HEADING] Quick links\nThe Master’s degree programme in Materials brings students in contact with the latest research in Materials Science and Engineering and allows them to explore a variety of areas of expertise in Materials and the neighbouring disciplines.\nPlease note that students starting from HS 2023 will be subject to new study programme regulations. The main difference is that a mandatory industrial internship will be introduced instead of a second research project. In addition, the Download list of core courses (PDF, 69 KB) has been updated.\nThe Master’s degree programme in Materials Science and Engineering consists of course work and practical experience in research and development. Its structure allows the students to create a study program that is aligned with their personal interests.\nThe core courses allow the students to strengthen fundamental understanding by going deep into topics in materials structure, properties and characterization. With the choice of elective courses, the students may specialize in materials-related areas, such as materials for energy technology, semiconductor materials, nano-science and -technology or others. They may also broaden their horizon across disciplines by attending Master level courses offered by the other departments at ETH Zurich. In addition, all students at ETH Zurich must obtain credit points in the Science in Perspective course program in the area of humanities, social and political sciences.\nFor students starting their studies in HS 2022, practical experience is obtained by performing two research projects in one of ETH Zurich's many research groups in Materials. For students starting their studies in HS 2023, practical experience is a combination of a research project carried out at ETH Zürich and an industrial internship.\nThe Master's degree programme is concluded by a Master's thesis.\n120 credit points need to be acquired in order to obtain the Master's degree in Materials Science and Engineering. This corresponds to at least 4 semesters of studies. The credit points are awarded based on the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS). 1 credit point corresponds to an average student workload of 30 hours.\nThe language of instruction is English and the programme is designed as a full-time study programme.\nStudents with a Bachelor's degree from the Department of Materials at ETH Zurich can start both in the autumn or spring semester. Students of universities other than ETH Zurich have to apply to the programme. In case of admission, they can start in the autumn semester.\nETH Zurich\n                    Department of Materials\n                    Leopold-Ruzicka-Weg 4\n                HCP F 33.1\n                8093 \n                Zürich\n            Switzerland\n• Homepage\n• Navigation\n• Search\n• Content\n• Footer\n• Contact\n• Sitemap\n• Phone\n                        +41 44 632 25 20\n• Application Master\n• Forms and Documents\n• Download\r\n            Study Guide for the Master's degree programme, Regl. 2012\r\n               (PDF, 335 KB)\n• Download\r\n            Study Guide for the Master's degree programme, Regl. 2023\r\n               (PDF, 295 KB)\n[CARD]\nContact\nPlease note that students starting from HS 2023 will be subject to new study programme regulations.
