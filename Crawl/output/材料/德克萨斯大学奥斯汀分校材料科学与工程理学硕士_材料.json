Only under special circumstances and when initiated by faculty members, M.S. degrees may be granted. At this time, M.S. students are not being admitted and M.S. inquiries might go unanswered. It is the responsibility of the applicant to reach out to faculty and inquire about such positions.\nMaterials Science and Engineering students who are supported by a research or teaching assistantship must select the Master of Science in Engineering with thesis option. This option requires that students do original laboratory research and write a thesis based on their own work. A minimum of 24 credit hours of coursework is required, plus 6 credit hours of thesis. Students are expected to complete coursework requirements within four long-session semesters (plus a summer session).\nGRADUATE STUDIES COMMITTEE\nGRADUATE PROGRAM HANDBOOK\nGraduate Program Coordinator IImse@austin.utexas.edu 512-471-1504\nYuebing Zheng, Ph.D.Graduate Advisorzheng@austin.utexas.edu\n© The University of Texas at Austin  | Privacy Policy | Web Accessibility\n• Home\n• About\n• AcademicsOverviewUndergraduate MinorGraduate ProgramStudent CommunityProspective StudentsOutreach\n• Overview\n• Undergraduate Minor\n• Graduate Program\n• Student Community\n• Prospective Students\n• Outreach\n• People\n• Research\n• Facilities\n• News and Events\n• Overview\n• Undergraduate Minor\n• Graduate Program\n• Student Community\n• Prospective Students\n• Outreach\n• Home\n• AboutOverviewLeadershipVisit UsContact Us\n• Overview\n• Leadership\n• Visit Us\n• Contact Us\n• AcademicsOverviewUndergraduate MinorGraduate ProgramStudent CommunityProspective StudentsOutreach\n• Overview\n• Undergraduate Minor\n• Graduate Program\n• Student Community\n• Prospective Students\n• Outreach\n• PeopleOverviewFaculty DirectoryStaff DirectoryCore FacultyGraduate Studies CommitteeExecutive CommitteeUndergraduate Education Committee\n• Overview\n• Faculty Directory\n• Staff Directory\n• Core Faculty\n• Graduate Studies Committee\n• Executive Committee\n• Undergraduate Education Committee\n• ResearchOverviewEnergy MaterialsNanomaterialsStructural MaterialsElectronic and Photonic MaterialsPolymers and BiomaterialsComputational Materials ScienceMaterials Characterization\n• Overview\n• Energy Materials\n• Nanomaterials\n• Structural Materials\n• Electronic and Photonic Materials\n• Polymers and Biomaterials\n• Computational Materials Science\n• Materials Characterization\n• FacilitiesOverviewMaterials Analysis and Spectroscopy FacilityCleanroom Nanofabrication FacilityElectron Microscopy FacilityUser InformationNNCI and TMI\n• Overview\n• Materials Analysis and Spectroscopy Facility\n• Cleanroom Nanofabrication Facility\n• Electron Microscopy Facility\n• User Information\n• NNCI and TMI\n• News and EventsOverviewCalendarSeminarsNewsletter\n• Overview\n• Calendar\n• Seminars\n• Newsletter\n• Overview\n• Leadership\n• Visit Us\n• Contact Us\n• Overview\n• Faculty Directory\n• Staff Directory\n• Core Faculty\n• Graduate Studies Committee\n• Executive Committee\n• Undergraduate Education Committee\n• Overview\n• Energy Materials\n• Nanomaterials\n• Structural Materials\n• Electronic and Photonic Materials\n• Polymers and Biomaterials\n• Computational Materials Science\n• Materials Characterization\n• Overview\n• Materials Analysis and Spectroscopy Facility\n• Cleanroom Nanofabrication Facility\n• Electron Microscopy Facility\n• User Information\n• NNCI and TMI\n• Overview\n• Calendar\n• Seminars\n• Newsletter\n• Overview\n• Undergraduate MinorMinor RequirementsHow to ApplyOptional CoursesFrequently Asked Questions\n• Minor Requirements\n• How to Apply\n• Optional Courses\n• Frequently Asked Questions\n• Graduate ProgramDoctoral ProgramMaster's ProgramAdmissionsFundingCoursesThrust AreasFrequently Asked Questions\n• Doctoral Program\n• Master's Program\n• Admissions\n• Funding\n• Courses\n• Thrust Areas\n• Frequently Asked Questions\n• Student Community\n• Prospective StudentsFAQs\n• FAQs\n• Outreach\n• Minor Requirements\n• How to Apply\n• Optional Courses\n• Frequently Asked Questions\n• Doctoral Program\n• Master's Program\n• Admissions\n• Funding\n• Courses\n• Thrust Areas\n• Frequently Asked Questions\n• FAQs\n• Contact Us\n• ENGR Direct\n• Faculty Directory\n• Instrumentation Reservations\n• Seminars\n• Staff Directory\n• Graduate Student Handbook\n• UT Directory\n• Give",

Each graduate program sets its own application deadline. The application process may take several weeks to complete; you should apply well in advance of the deadline to ensure adequate time to submit all required items. After you apply, keep up with it all by monitoring MyStatus.\nApplicants to graduate programs at The University of Texas at Austin should complete the appropriate application for admission. Please note that applications can take 2-3 business days to load to the University of Texas at Austin system after submission of the application form.\nMyStatus offers applicants secure, individualized information from initial application submission to the final admission decision and beyond. Use it to track the receipt of submitted application materials, to upload required supporting documents, to confirm that your application file is complete, and to get your decision.\nAfter you submit your online application, you’ll receive an email (within 2-3 business days) that will provide you with MyStatus login information.\nUse it often—it’s the only way you’ll know if items are missing from your application file.\nChoose the application that applies to your program of interest.\nAll Other Programs\nIf your program is not listed above, complete the Graduate School Application for Admission to begin your application.\nPay your non-refundable application fee by credit card (Visa, MasterCard, Discover, and American Express accepted) or electronic check. You will pay your application fee via your MyStatus 2-3 business days after submission of the application form.\nApplication Fees:\nIf you can’t afford the application fee and are a U.S. citizen or permanent resident applying to pursue a graduate degree for the first time, you may be eligible for a fee waiver (not available for the MBA or MPA programs). Fee waivers are not available for international citizens.\nDemonstrate your need for an application fee waiver by providing a copy of:\nWait until you receive the email with a link to your MyStatus page, redact your Social Security number from any documentation you plan to send, then email it to shannon.neuse@austin.utexas.edu attached as PDF files.\nMake sure you include your UT EID in the email; without this information, your request cannot be processed. Please note that it will take 2-3 business days from when you submit the application before you receive the status check email – do not send your request prior to receiving that email.\nYou will be unable to upload any documents to MyStatus until your fee is waived or paid.\nAfter satisfying the application fee, provide an official transcript from every senior college you have attended. Even if courses taken at one institution are recorded on another college's transcript, transcripts must be submitted from the institution at which the courses were taken. Failure to list all colleges on the application and provide those transcripts will be considered an intentional omission and may lead to the cancellation of your application for admission or withdrawal of your offer of admission.\nOfficial transcripts bear the facsimile signature of the registrar and the seal of the issuing institution. Transcripts from U.S. colleges or universities must have been produced within the last calendar year, and should include the award of degree printed on the transcript unless coursework is still in progress. Transcripts written in a language other than English must be accompanied by a translation, and if a degree was awarded, you will need to provide the separate award of degree or degree certificate document. We do not accept outside evaluations of foreign transcripts. Each transcript (mark sheet) should contain a complete record of studies at the institution from which it is issued (i.e., the subjects taken and grades [marks] earned in each subject).\nBelow are acceptable submission methods:\nIf your college or university uses SPEEDE, you can have your transcript(s) sent electronically. Check with the registrar of your institution to find out if transcripts can be sent via the SPEEDE server, as well as instructions for placing an order.\nInstitutions who utilize SPEEDE\nIf your college or university uses Parchment, you can have your transcript(s) sent electronically. Please note that due to the sending institution’s system limitations, we cannot currently accept transcripts through Parchment from University of Kansas, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), National Louis University, Dartmouth College, Southern Utah University and Northwestern University.\nIf you obtain a Parchment transcript directly and upload it to your application, please be aware it cannot be used to clear you for registration upon admission. As such, you should have the transcript sent directly to UT Austin.\nFirst, review the guidelines for uploading transcripts, linked below. Then, upload a PDF using the Document Upload System  . You can upload an official PDF transcript issued by the institution or a scan of the official paper transcript issued to you by the registrar. Uploads will be considered unofficial if admitted, but can be used to process your application for admission. You should redact your Social Security number from the transcript before you upload, but other alterations are not permitted.\nInstructions for Uploading Transcripts\nUploads require verification, a process which can take 2 to 3 business days. You should upload your transcripts well in advance of the deadline to allow adequate time for processing. Failure to do so could result in your application being considered late. Do not upload unofficial transcripts or other documents that do not meet requirements, even as temporary placeholders. Doing so will delay processing of your application and could lead to cancellation for being late.\nWe cannot accept electronic transcripts sent by registrars or third-party entities in any other format (e.g. by email or by links to secure websites). Please do not mail official transcripts or paper copies of your transcripts before you are offered admission. Sending paper copies of documents will significantly delay the processing of your application.\nSome programs may also request that you upload copies of your transcripts when submitting the application form. These are not provided to the Office of Graduate Admissions with your application form and therefore cannot be used to fulfill the MyStatus transcript requirements.\nThose applying to the master's program in professional accounting or nursing must also submit transcripts from junior and/or community colleges.\nApplicants who have previously attended the university will be automatically billed $20 for transcripts, payable via the What I Owe link above. Do not order transcripts directly from the university registrar, as doing so will slow processing.\nMost programs require the GRE or GMAT. Check with your program of application to see which test is required or if a waiver is available.\nAll portions of the test are to be taken on your designated testing date, otherwise, the score will be considered incomplete and cannot be used as part of your application.\nInternational students applying to UT Austin must submit an official score report demonstrating an adequate knowledge of English. See link below for more information.\nAdditional information for International Students\nAsk the appropriate testing agency to send your official test scores as required by your program of application.\nThe Educational Testing Service institution code for the GRE and TOEFL is 6882. The institutional code for the GMAT is 396-44-45. It is not necessary to use a department code, but if you must select one, choose one that is similar to your proposed major.\nTo fulfill the requirement with scores from the IELTS, please use the IELTS electronic score delivery service to send your scores to the “University of Texas at Austin” account.\nThe university generally receives scores four to six weeks after a test is taken if the university is designated as a score recipient at the time of testing.\nIf you are sending scores from a prior test, the scores must still be reportable and valid at the time you submit your application (within the last five years for the GRE or GMAT and two years for the TOEFL or IELTS).\nAll programs have additional requirements that you must complete before they will consider your application for admission.\nLetters of recommendation for almost all programs are submitted electronically. (Most master’s programs in Business use an alternate submission method for letters of recommendation. Check the program’s website for complete information.)\nYou will be given the opportunity to list the name, position, organization and email address for three recommenders when you complete the application. Emails will be sent to your recommenders directing them to a website where they may respond to the recommendation request.\nMyStatus offers a self-service feature you can use to resend the request email to your recommenders, if necessary. Use it to supply an alternate email address if your recommender’s spam filter blocks the original request or has removed the link. You can also add a new recommender or revise your right-to-view status from “retained” to “waived.”\nIf your recommender is unable to submit an electronic letter of recommendation, consult the program to which you are applying for instructions.\nCheck the website of the program you are applying to for instructions on submitting additional supporting documents.\nMost programs will allow you to upload additional required materials via MyStatus.\nNot all graduate programs offer the option for students to enroll as a non-degree seeker. Before applying, check with the graduate program of interest to see if they offer the non-degree option. The application process for a non-degree seeker is the same as degree seeking students. Enrollment is limited to one year, and a bachelor’s degree is required. Check with the graduate program to determine if the GRE/GMAT is required, as it may be waived for non-degree seeking applicants. The TOEFL/IELTS is required of all international applicants unless they meet the waiver requirements.\nAll programs have additional requirements such as letters of recommendation or a statement of purpose that you may need complete before they will consider your application. Check with the program you are applying to for instructions on submitting additional supporting documents. Please note that if the program does not require these documents, they may still be requested by the Graduate School before your application can be considered for admission.\nIf you later decide to seek a graduate degree, you must apply as a degree-seeking student by the program deadline. A degree-seeking student may petition to have applied to the master’s degree up to six semester hours of credit in graduate-level courses earned while enrolled as a non-degree seeking student.\n• Texas McCombs MBA\n• Masters in Professional Accounting\n• Masters in Science - Business Analytics\n• Masters in Science - Finance\n• Masters in Science - Health Care Transformation\n• Masters in Science - Information Technology and Management\n• Masters in Science - Marketing\n• Masters in Science - Technology Commercialization\n• MBA (and dual programs with MBA): $200\n• MPA: $125\n• All other programs:U.S. Graduate: $65International Graduate: $90\n• U.S. Graduate: $65\n• International Graduate: $90\n• U.S. Graduate: $65\n• International Graduate: $90\n• A fee waiver granted by GRE; or\n• If you are currently enrolled at an institution, your financial aid awards for the previous two semesters showing the source(s) of your funding; or\n• If you are not currently enrolled, your tax returns for the last two years.\n[GRID_TABLE]\nApplication for admission to the Graduate School is a multi-step process.

For more information please review the University of Texas Course Schedule.\n• Please see the “People” tab above and choose “Faculty Directory”. If looking for faculty who specifically supervise MS&E program students, please see \"Graduate Studies Committee\".\n• Graduates of the MS&E Program at UT Austin have an exceptional range of job opportunities within the high technology sector, academia, or at national laboratories throughout the US and abroad.\n• No, all of the necessary information can be found here on our website. If you have any questions that we have not addressed please feel free to e-mail the MS&E Graduate Coordinator: This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it..\n• Since our program is heavily research-based, we tend to admit only Ph.D. students. Only under special circumstances and when initiated by faculty members, M.S. degrees may be granted. At this time, M.S. students are not being admitted and M.S. inquiries might go unanswered. It is the responsibility of the applicant to reach out to faculty and inquire about such positions.\n• Yes, both degree plans are open to domestic and international students.\n• No, there is no pre-admission screening process. We cannot tell you whether or not you will likely be admitted. Our admissions committee reviews completed applications immediately following the deadlines.\n• There are no specific requirements for admission to the MS&E program but applicants would benefit greatly from having a B.S. degree in physical sciences (chemistry, physics) or engineering disciplines. Generally, these majors have similar requirements for math (calculus and differential equations), chemistry and physics (for scientists and engineers) that are the underpinnings of MS&E. Biology and non-science majors usually have not completed these courses.\n• The Graduate School requires a 3.0/4.0 in upper-division courses to apply. GPAs below a 3.0 may, in rare cases, be admitted with conditions. GPAs above the minimum do not guarantee admission to the program. For more information on admissions requirements visit the Office of Graduate Studies Requirements of Graduate Admission.\n• No. We do not admit students who already have a graduate degree in a similar field for a duplicate second degree. Masters students interested in a PhD are welcome, but students seeking a second Masters or second PhD who already hold that degree in a similar field (metallurgy, materials, ceramics, polymers, etc.) should not apply.\n• There is no minimum score required by MS&E and we do not require any special subject tests.\n• GRE scores are now optional/not required for Summer 2025 applicants and beyond.\n• For more information on test scores see the Graduate School\n• A score of 79 (internet based test) on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL)\n• A 6.5 on the Academic Examination of the International English Language Testing System (IELTS).\n• Scores above the minimum do not guarantee admission and please keep in mind that TOEFL scores are only valid for 2 years following the test date. Our program does not accept expired test scores.\n• For purposes of the TOEFL or IELTS requirement, international applicants are exempt only if they are from a country where English is the sole official language and the primary conversational language of the country. In some countries, English is but one of the officially recognized languages or it is not the primary language used to communicate outside of the classroom.\nStudents from the following countries are exempt from the TOEFL/IELTS requirement:\n\nAmerican Samoa\nAustralia\nBahamas\nBarbados\nBelize\nCanada (except Quebec)\nDominica\nGhana\nGrenada\nGrand Cayman\nGuyana\nIndia\nIreland\nJamaica\nKenya\nLiberia\nNew Zealand\nNigeria\nSingapore\nTrinidad/Tobago\nTurks and Caicos Islands\nUnited Kingdom\nU.S. Pacific Trus\n• American Samoa\n• Australia\n• Bahamas\n• Barbados\n• Belize\n• Canada (except Quebec)\n• Dominica\n• Ghana\n• Grenada\n• Grand Cayman\n• Guyana\n• India\n• Ireland\n• Jamaica\n• Kenya\n• Liberia\n• New Zealand\n• Nigeria\n• Singapore\n• Trinidad/Tobago\n• Turks and Caicos Islands\n• United Kingdom\n• U.S. Pacific Trus\n• GRE scores CAN NO LONGER BE WAIVED.\n• American Samoa\n• Australia\n• Bahamas\n• Barbados\n• Belize\n• Canada (except Quebec)\n• Dominica\n• Ghana\n• Grenada\n• Grand Cayman\n• Guyana\n• India\n• Ireland\n• Jamaica\n• Kenya\n• Liberia\n• New Zealand\n• Nigeria\n• Singapore\n• Trinidad/Tobago\n• Turks and Caicos Islands\n• United Kingdom\n• U.S. Pacific Trus\n• Spring admissions: October 1st of the previous year\n• Fall admissions: December 15th of the previous year\n• These deadlines are for both domestic and international students.\n• These deadlines are for *all* application materials. Because of the highly competitive nature of our program we cannot accept late materials. Please plan accordingly and begin your application well before the deadline.\n• No, we do not. We only accept transfers from other UT Austin programs in very rare circumstances. Generally speaking you will need to complete your current program and apply to ours like everyone else.\n• No, we do not have a required page or word limit for the Statement of Purpose.\n• As a department, we do not offer fee waivers. Our Graduate and International Admissions Center handles all other fee waivers. You can find more information here.\n• We require three (3) letters of recommendation for your application. Please be mindful that all letters must be submitted via the application portal, so emailed or mailed letters will not be accepted.\n• Please visit the Cockrell School of Engineering Graduate Admissions page. There is a checklist and detailed instructions.\n• If you are reapplying within one year of your previous application, you will need to complete a new application, send new transcripts, and pay another fee. However, your test scores and recommendation letters will carry over from the previous application. You are more than welcome to update them if you like. If it has been over a year since you last applied, you will have to resubmit everything.\n• Use the GPA Calculator on the Registrar’s page.\n• All GPA information should be provided on a 4-point scale. Only upper division undergraduate and graduate courses should be used in this calculation.\n• Keep in mind that the Graduate and International Admissions Center will calculate your official GPA for official purposes.\n• You will upload your supporting documentation via the online application portal.\n• No, we will not accept any paper copies of application materials. Please follow the instructions online carefully to ensure your application is completed by the deadline.\n• No, to complete your application the fee must be paid.\n• The Office of Graduate Studies may grant a fee waiver in rare cases based on documented financial need. Please visit their site for more information on requesting a waiver.\n• You will be prompted to set one up during the application process.\n• For issues with an existing EID, please visit the UT EID site.\n• Please do not create multiple EIDs for yourself. Only the EID that is sent to you via email acknowledging receipt of your application will be linked to your academic record. Your EID will be used as an identifier from this point forward so please include it in emails to the program so that we can better assist you.\n• There is no separate financial application. Because we are a highly competitive program, all of our students generally receive funding. For most of our students, funding generally includes tuition benefits, healthcare, and a stipend.\n• No, any outside financial support you apply for will be your responsibility.\n• No, your application needs to be completed by the deadline. We will not allow edits after the fact. The application is open for months before the deadline, giving ample time to complete the requirements.\n• Check your MyStatus page for all application updates and decisions.\n• Using the “People” tab above, choose the faculty member whose research most closely resembles your interests. You are more than welcome to email the faculty member to introduce yourself and indicate your interest in their research group. Keep in mind that they will not give you any application assessment but they do control admissions. Be courteous and mindful that our faculty are very busy and may not reply immediately.\n• For Fall admissions, we finalize all decisions by May 15.\n• For Spring admissions, we finalize all decisions by November 15.\n• You can monitor the status of your application via the MyStatus site and can email any questions to This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it..\n• All admitted applicants will be contacted directly via email notifying them of their admission and requesting further information. Students denied admission will be notified via the MyStatus site.\n• Unfortunately no. We receive an incredibly large number of applications each year and due to legal restrictions, we cannot provide any additional information to applicants that are not offered admission. We receive and must turn away many highly qualified applicants each year.\n• Check the MyStatus site for application updates and completion status. You can also use this site to remind your references of missing letters of reference.\n• Keep in mind that it can take several weeks for your test scores to be matched with your online application. If you have received confirmation from ETS or IELTS that your test scores have been received by the university and processed, but you do not see them on MyStatus, the university is probably still in the matching process.\n• Any updates must be submitted through the online application portal. Updates made after the deadline will not be viewed by the admissions committee so please be mindful of this when submitting your application.\n• 20-40 students based on many factors including but not limited to faculty availability, quality of applicants, and funding.\n• We do not have a set number or percentage of domestic or international students that we admit.\n• MSE Advising Form\n• MSE Learning Outcomes Form\n• MSE Preliminary Oral Exam Form\n• MSE Program of Work Form\n• Report of Dissertation Committee\n• Request for Final Oral Examination\n• Coauthor Approval Form\n• Request to Delay Publication\n• Contact Us\n• ENGR Direct\n• Faculty Directory\n• Instrumentation Reservations\n• Seminars\n• Staff Directory\n• Graduate Student Handbook\n• UT Directory\n• Give",

Submission of Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores will be optional for all students. While it is possible that strong GRE scores will enhance an application, the absence of reported scores will have no negative impact on a candidate’s chance of admission.\nPlease note that since our program is heavily research-based, we tend to admit only Ph.D. students. Only under special circumstances and when initiated by faculty members, M.S. degrees may be granted. At this time, M.S. students are not being admitted and M.S. inquiries might go unanswered. It is the responsibility of the applicant to reach out to faculty and inquire about such positions.\nApplications for admission are accepted for fall and spring for both doctoral and master's degree programs. All admissions decision are made in the context of laboratory space and resources available each year.\nPlease also note that since our program is very heavily research-based, we tend to admit only Ph.D. students. We do admit master's candidates occasionally when a faculty member has an opening in their research group for an M.S. student. It is the responsibility of the applicant to reach out to faculty and inquire about such positions.\nDomestic Students: ALL materials are due by December 15th. No late materials will be eligible for review so please plan accordingly and begin your application well before the deadline.\nInternational Students: ALL materials are due by December 15th. We will accept TOEFL/IELTS & GRE scores until January 15th. This means they must be submitted by then, not that you can take your exam on January 15th. Since the availability of testing centers is sparse in some regions of the world, we would like to accommodate international students within reason by extending the deadline for only those two materials. The rest of your application must be completed by December 15th without exception.\nDomestic & International Students: ALL materials are due by October 1st. No late materials of any kind will be eligible for review so please plan accordingly and begin your application well before the deadline.\nApplications that are incomplete as of the listed deadline, including all documents and scores, will not be given full consideration. The deadline is absolute and we cannot grant extensions due to the condensed timeline of the admissions process.\nAfter submitting your application for admission through the Cockrell School of Engineering, it can take up to 48 hours to receive a link to upload required documents. Please take this into consideration and submit your application early.\nOur program handles admissions in a manner that is unique among materials graduate programs. Most programs will offer general admission to qualified students. When those students enroll, they will then have a semester, or in some cases, a full year to choose a research supervisor and project.\nWe prefer to do things differently. We consider the research interests of the applicants alongside the research interests of faculty who are seeking new students. We match the research interests of both parties to ensure a satisfactory research experience on both sides. This takes a little time during the admissions process, but it saves the student and the faculty supervisor a great deal of time when the student enrolls. Entering a graduate program with a faculty supervisor in place allows students to begin research immediately, which in turn enables the students to choose courses that are directly related to their research projects.\nAs stated above, these faculty-applicant matches are made during the admissions process, which means it takes a little longer for admitted applicants to receive offers of admission. However, when an admitted applicant receives an offer, it comes directly from a specific faculty member, giving the applicant a clear idea of what to expect regarding his or her research project.\nThe MS&E admissions committee takes a holistic approach to application reviews. We fully review every application that we receive by the established deadline. We do not use cut-off scores to eliminate applicants from the pool, and we do not require minimum GRE scores to apply. The committee considers all parts of the application when making admission decisions:\nTOEFL/IELTS scores (if applicable) are required to apply.

Initially, a student must qualify for doctoral candidacy. Many degree programs require a formal qualifying exam that students must pass in order to apply for doctoral candidacy. The Materials Science & Engineering program does not require an exam. Rather, we have a unique qualifying process based on coursework. Once a student has passed the qualifying process, they are eligible to apply for doctoral candidacy. At this stage and in cooperation with their faculty supervisor, the student will create a committee and begin a more focused approach to research. One aspect of this focused approach is the preliminary oral exam, in which a student proposes a plan of research for their dissertation topic. Finally, the Ph.D. pursuit will conclude with a formal dissertation and defense. To review the requirements for your current stage within the doctoral program, please see our handbook.\nMost students will enter the program having already selected a faculty supervisor. Your faculty supervisor plays a vital role in all areas of your graduate education; therefore, it is very important that you discuss your research regularly with this person. Make sure you attend all group meetings and that your course selections meet both the Materials Science and Engineering program thrust area requirements and your faculty supervisor’s approval.\nCORE FACULTY\nGRADUATE STUDIES COMMITTEE\nGRADUATE PROGRAM HANDBOOK\nGraduate Program Coordinator IImse@austin.utexas.edu 512-471-1504\nYuebing Zheng, Ph.D.Graduate Advisorzheng@austin.utexas.edu\nFALL 2025 RECRUITMENT PROJECTS\n© The University of Texas at Austin  | Privacy Policy | Web Accessibility\n• Home\n• About\n• AcademicsOverviewUndergraduate MinorGraduate ProgramStudent CommunityProspective StudentsOutreach\n• Overview\n• Undergraduate Minor\n• Graduate Program\n• Student Community\n• Prospective Students\n• Outreach\n• People\n• Research\n• Facilities\n• News and Events\n• Overview\n• Undergraduate Minor\n• Graduate Program\n• Student Community\n• Prospective Students\n• Outreach\n• Home\n• AboutOverviewLeadershipVisit UsContact Us\n• Overview\n• Leadership\n• Visit Us\n• Contact Us\n• AcademicsOverviewUndergraduate MinorGraduate ProgramStudent CommunityProspective StudentsOutreach\n• Overview\n• Undergraduate Minor\n• Graduate Program\n• Student Community\n• Prospective Students\n• Outreach\n• PeopleOverviewFaculty DirectoryStaff DirectoryCore FacultyGraduate Studies CommitteeExecutive CommitteeUndergraduate Education Committee\n• Overview\n• Faculty Directory\n• Staff Directory\n• Core Faculty\n• Graduate Studies Committee\n• Executive Committee\n• Undergraduate Education Committee\n• ResearchOverviewEnergy MaterialsNanomaterialsStructural MaterialsElectronic and Photonic MaterialsPolymers and BiomaterialsComputational Materials ScienceMaterials Characterization\n• Overview\n• Energy Materials\n• Nanomaterials\n• Structural Materials\n• Electronic and Photonic Materials\n• Polymers and Biomaterials\n• Computational Materials Science\n• Materials Characterization\n• FacilitiesOverviewMaterials Analysis and Spectroscopy FacilityCleanroom Nanofabrication FacilityElectron Microscopy FacilityUser InformationNNCI and TMI\n• Overview\n• Materials Analysis and Spectroscopy Facility\n• Cleanroom Nanofabrication Facility\n• Electron Microscopy Facility\n• User Information\n• NNCI and TMI\n• News and EventsOverviewCalendarSeminarsNewsletter\n• Overview\n• Calendar\n• Seminars\n• Newsletter\n• Overview\n• Leadership\n• Visit Us\n• Contact Us\n• Overview\n• Faculty Directory\n• Staff Directory\n• Core Faculty\n• Graduate Studies Committee\n• Executive Committee\n• Undergraduate Education Committee\n• Overview\n• Energy Materials\n• Nanomaterials\n• Structural Materials\n• Electronic and Photonic Materials\n• Polymers and Biomaterials\n• Computational Materials Science\n• Materials Characterization\n• Overview\n• Materials Analysis and Spectroscopy Facility\n• Cleanroom Nanofabrication Facility\n• Electron Microscopy Facility\n• User Information\n• NNCI and TMI\n• Overview\n• Calendar\n• Seminars\n• Newsletter\n• Overview\n• Undergraduate MinorMinor RequirementsHow to ApplyOptional CoursesFrequently Asked Questions\n• Minor Requirements\n• How to Apply\n• Optional Courses\n• Frequently Asked Questions\n• Graduate ProgramDoctoral ProgramMaster's ProgramAdmissionsFundingCoursesThrust AreasFrequently Asked Questions\n• Doctoral Program\n• Master's Program\n• Admissions\n• Funding\n• Courses\n• Thrust Areas\n• Frequently Asked Questions\n• Student Community\n• Prospective StudentsFAQs\n• FAQs\n• Outreach\n• Minor Requirements\n• How to Apply\n• Optional Courses\n• Frequently Asked Questions\n• Doctoral Program\n• Master's Program\n• Admissions\n• Funding\n• Courses\n• Thrust Areas\n• Frequently Asked Questions\n• FAQs\n• Contact Us\n• ENGR Direct\n• Faculty Directory\n• Instrumentation Reservations\n• Seminars\n• Staff Directory\n• Graduate Student Handbook\n• UT Directory\n• Give",

For example, I am in my first year and have 69 credit hours. Am I not eligible to apply for the minor because I have too many credit hours?\n[HEADING] I have started at UT with a significant number of hours from AP credits or credit from other sources. For example, I am about to start my first semester at UT and have 32 credit hours. Should I go ahead and apply for the minor?\n[HEADING] Cockrell School of EngineeringCollege of Natural Sciences\n[HEADING] Resources\nIt is likely you are on a catalog that does not align with the minor. The MS&E minor is offered on the 2018-2020 and future catalogs, so you will need to inquire with your academic advisor and see if switching catalogs is an option for you.\nPossibly, but preference will be given to students in the minor.\nNot at this time.\nYes, but you may find enrollment limits.\nTalk to your Undergraduate Advisor and let them know they can talk to Desiderio Kovar for further information.\nGenerally, you can still apply for the minor in this case. We are primarily looking to see that you have at least 4 semesters left in residence at UT Austin. If you do, we will likely accept your application, assuming you meet the other requirements. As always, if you have specific questions about your situation, contact the minor coordinator or advisor.\nProbably not. In this case you want to wait a semester or two until you have an academic record from UT Austin.\n© The University of Texas at Austin  | Privacy Policy | Web Accessibility\n• Home\n• About\n• AcademicsOverviewUndergraduate MinorGraduate ProgramStudent CommunityProspective StudentsOutreach\n• Overview\n• Undergraduate Minor\n• Graduate Program\n• Student Community\n• Prospective Students\n• Outreach\n• People\n• Research\n• Facilities\n• News and Events\n• Overview\n• Undergraduate Minor\n• Graduate Program\n• Student Community\n• Prospective Students\n• Outreach\n• Home\n• AboutOverviewLeadershipVisit UsContact Us\n• Overview\n• Leadership\n• Visit Us\n• Contact Us\n• AcademicsOverviewUndergraduate MinorGraduate ProgramStudent CommunityProspective StudentsOutreach\n• Overview\n• Undergraduate Minor\n• Graduate Program\n• Student Community\n• Prospective Students\n• Outreach\n• PeopleOverviewFaculty DirectoryStaff DirectoryCore FacultyGraduate Studies CommitteeExecutive CommitteeUndergraduate Education Committee\n• Overview\n• Faculty Directory\n• Staff Directory\n• Core Faculty\n• Graduate Studies Committee\n• Executive Committee\n• Undergraduate Education Committee\n• ResearchOverviewEnergy MaterialsNanomaterialsStructural MaterialsElectronic and Photonic MaterialsPolymers and BiomaterialsComputational Materials ScienceMaterials Characterization\n• Overview\n• Energy Materials\n• Nanomaterials\n• Structural Materials\n• Electronic and Photonic Materials\n• Polymers and Biomaterials\n• Computational Materials Science\n• Materials Characterization\n• FacilitiesOverviewMaterials Analysis and Spectroscopy FacilityCleanroom Nanofabrication FacilityElectron Microscopy FacilityUser InformationNNCI and TMI\n• Overview\n• Materials Analysis and Spectroscopy Facility\n• Cleanroom Nanofabrication Facility\n• Electron Microscopy Facility\n• User Information\n• NNCI and TMI\n• News and EventsOverviewCalendarSeminarsNewsletter\n• Overview\n• Calendar\n• Seminars\n• Newsletter\n• Overview\n• Leadership\n• Visit Us\n• Contact Us\n• Overview\n• Faculty Directory\n• Staff Directory\n• Core Faculty\n• Graduate Studies Committee\n• Executive Committee\n• Undergraduate Education Committee\n• Overview\n• Energy Materials\n• Nanomaterials\n• Structural Materials\n• Electronic and Photonic Materials\n• Polymers and Biomaterials\n• Computational Materials Science\n• Materials Characterization\n• Overview\n• Materials Analysis and Spectroscopy Facility\n• Cleanroom Nanofabrication Facility\n• Electron Microscopy Facility\n• User Information\n• NNCI and TMI\n• Overview\n• Calendar\n• Seminars\n• Newsletter\n• Overview\n• Undergraduate MinorMinor RequirementsHow to ApplyOptional CoursesFrequently Asked Questions\n• Minor Requirements\n• How to Apply\n• Optional Courses\n• Frequently Asked Questions\n• Graduate ProgramDoctoral ProgramMaster's ProgramAdmissionsFundingCoursesThrust AreasFrequently Asked Questions\n• Doctoral Program\n• Master's Program\n• Admissions\n• Funding\n• Courses\n• Thrust Areas\n• Frequently Asked Questions\n• Student Community\n• Prospective StudentsFAQs\n• FAQs\n• Outreach\n• Minor Requirements\n• How to Apply\n• Optional Courses\n• Frequently Asked Questions\n• Doctoral Program\n• Master's Program\n• Admissions\n• Funding\n• Courses\n• Thrust Areas\n• Frequently Asked Questions\n• FAQs\n• Contact Us\n• ENGR Direct\n• Faculty Directory\n• Instrumentation Reservations\n• Seminars\n• Staff Directory\n• Graduate Student Handbook\n• UT Directory\n• Give",
