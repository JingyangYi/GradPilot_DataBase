Transfer of credits:\nRequired Courses\nProcess for Selecting Advisors for Research and Independent Study\nStudents interested in pursuing the non-thesis option with independent study or the thesis option are encouraged to attend Faculty Research Presentations in the late August and September . Students can also meet with individual faculty and the Master’s Program Advisor to discuss their research interests.\nA selected number of awards designated “Master’s Scholars” will be made each year to deserving students to promote and enhance their research experience at Penn. The awards will enable highly motivated students (with a GPA of 3.25 or higher) to pursue a well-designed research project with a faculty member for one or two semesters and obtain valuable training in experimental and computational research. The award carries no financial benefit to the students; award funds are used solely to defray the costs of facility user fees, chemicals, computer resources, etc. Research proposals submitted by students will be evaluated and awards will be made on a competitive basis. A call for proposals occurs near the start of the fall and spring semesters.\nAt the end of the first academic year, the Masters Program Advisor will conduct a graduation audit for each student. The courses already completed and the courses needed to fulfill graduation requirement will be reviewed.\nAdditional Information\nFor additional details about M.S.E. degree procedures, see “Procedures for Advanced Degrees” and for general SEAS rules see the Graduate Student Handbook.\nThe following individuals can also be contacted for more information:\nMaster’s Program Director: Mahadevan Khantha, 221 LRSM (khantha@seas.upenn.edu)\nGraduate Group Chair: Ling Li, 308 LRSM (lzli@seas.upenn.edu)\nGraduate Group Coordinator: Irene Clements, 201 LRSM (ipc@seas.upenn.edu)\nApplying to Graduate Program FAQ\nGraduate Student Handbook\nGraduate Group Faculty\nGroups + Resources\nForms for Graduate Students\nMSE Newsletter Archive\nDr. Ling Li\nAssociate Professor and Graduate Group Chair\nEmail: lzli@seas.upenn.edu\nDr. Mahadevan Khantha\nSenior Lecturer;  Director, Master’s Program\nOffice: 221 LRSM\nEmail: khantha@seas.upenn.edu\nMs. Irene Clements\nGraduate Program Coordinator\nOffice: Room 201, LRSM\nPhone: 215-898-8337\nEmail: ipc@lrsm.upenn.edu\n• Non-thesis course-based option: Students successfully complete ten credits of courses at the 5000 or higher level.

A maximum of two free electives (5000 level or higher) are permitted. Free electives can be selected from across the university, including SEAS, SAS and Wharton. Also, free electives are not permitted for students pursuing a dual degree at Penn.\n5. During the first semester, Masters degree students are not permitted to take Independent Study and are required to enroll in only MSE courses.\n6. All Masters degree students must maintain a GPA of 2.7 or higher to be in good standing and for graduation. Students are required to attend weekly MSE seminars organized by the department as part of their education and exposure to latest scientific advances.\n7. Transfer of credits:\n\nA maximum of two graduate-level course units may be transferred from another school to apply toward the M.S.E. degree if approved by the Masters Program Advisor. These two courses cannot have been used in the fulfillment of an undergraduate degree.\nSub-matriculants may count up to three 5000 or higher level courses for both degrees\n\nRequired Courses\nNOTES:\n\nThesis Option ‐ Students who would like to complete a thesis may take two (2) units of MSE 5970 (Thesis Research).\nA maximum of two course units of Independent Study (MSE 5990) is allowed.\nA maximum of two graduate‐level course units may be transferred from another school to apply toward the M.S.E. degree if approved by the Masters Program Advisor. These two courses should not have been used in the fulfillment of an undergraduate degree. Sub-matriculants can count up to three 5000 or higher level courses for both degrees.\nProcess for Selecting Advisors for Research and Independent Study\nStudents interested in pursuing the non-thesis option with independent study or the thesis option are encouraged to attend Faculty Research Presentations in the late August and September . Students can also meet with individual faculty and the Master’s Program Advisor to discuss their research interests.\nA selected number of awards designated “Master’s Scholars” will be made each year to deserving students to promote and enhance their research experience at Penn. The awards will enable highly motivated students (with a GPA of 3.25 or higher) to pursue a well-designed research project with a faculty member for one or two semesters and obtain valuable training in experimental and computational research. The award carries no financial benefit to the students; award funds are used solely to defray the costs of facility user fees, chemicals, computer resources, etc. Research proposals submitted by students will be evaluated and awards will be made on a competitive basis. A call for proposals occurs near the start of the fall and spring semesters.\nAt the end of the first academic year, the Masters Program Advisor will conduct a graduation audit for each student. The courses already completed and the courses needed to fulfill graduation requirement will be reviewed.",

She can answer whatever questions you may have at any stage of the process.\nYou should apply for the Ph.D. degree program. The requirements for the Ph.D. degree program supersede those for the M.S.E. degree program, thus the requirements for the master’s degree are automatically fulfilled during the course of your Ph.D. degree studies. You do not need to conduct two separate research projects (one for the M.S.E. degree, one for the Ph.D. degree) to obtain both degrees.\nThe Institution Code for sending TOEFL and GRE scores to the University of Pennsylvania is 2888.\nYes, transfers from other departments are accepted, provided they meet the criteria set forth for all graduate students in the Materials Science and Engineering department. Transfer students are typically asked to include a letter of recommendation from a faculty member at their current school.\nThe following links provide information on the Graduate Application Process for the School of Engineering and Applied Science.\nThe underlying question that needs to be answered by your application is, “Does this applicant have the potential to be a research scientist?” Your academic background is a large part of this question. If you have previous undergraduate or industrial research experience, it makes it easier for the evaluation committee to discern your research ability. Your letters of recommendation are also important since they are often written by professors and those who evaluate research ability. The content of the application should demonstrate that you have the potential to be a research scientist. If your application does this, then you should feel confident in you acceptance to the MSE Department at Penn Engineering.\nIf you are a student in the U.S., you will be invited to visit Penn so that you can make a firsthand evaluation of whether Penn and the MSE Department are right for you. During the visit, you will speak with faculty and graduate students, receive a tour of both the department and the campus, and be treated to lunch at a local restaurant. Often, other activities can be planned with the graduate students, depending on the length of your stay. The MSE Department will reimburse you for your travel expenses. Visits by international applicants are not planned due to the complexities and costs of international travel.\nThe next step for you is to determine if you will accept the offer to conduct graduate studies at Penn. The official deadline for notifying the MSE Department with your decision is April 15.\nThe Materials Science and Engineering website contains a wealth of information about both the department and Penn Engineering.\nTo start, you can read the Welcome from our Department Chair and also visit the University website to learn more about Penn and Philadelphia.\nWhen you are accepted to the MSE Department at Penn (Ph.D. only), you will receive two (2) letters regarding your acceptance. The first letter concerns admissions and is sent from the School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS). The second letter concerns the research fellowship and is sent directly from the MSE Department.\nAny member of the MSE Graduate Group can serve as a research advisor. Students may already have an advisor at the time of admission. Even if you accepted our offer without a thesis advisor, you probably have an advisor or two in mind because they are likely one reason why you chose Penn and the MSE Department. You are encouraged to contact them or other potential advisors as soon as possible to make virtual or office appointments, and you may also want to speak with their graduate students or post-docs. This is to determine if there is a common interest and if the working environment is compatible with your expectations. Through this process you may finalize the advisor selection prior to arrival at Penn. If not, then you will complete the process on campus and submit to the Graduate Group Chair a ranked list of your top three advisors by October 1st of the first semester. In consultation with faculty, the Graduate Group Chair will determine which students will join which groups. The likelihood that you will be able to work with your highest ranked advisor is typically 100 percent.\nYes, see the answer to “How do I choose an advisor?” Again, students almost always get to work with their top-ranked advisor, so you shouldn’t have to worry about it too much.\nOne option is the University’s on-campus graduate student housing (https://www.graduateadmissions.upenn.edu/moving/housing/).

She can answer whatever questions you may have at any stage of the process.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf I want to get a master's degree (M.S.E. degree) as well as a Ph.D. degree, should I apply to the M.S.E. degree program or the Ph.D. degree program?\n\n\n\n\nYou should apply for the Ph.D. degree program. The requirements for the Ph.D. degree program supersede those for the M.S.E. degree program, thus the requirements for the master’s degree are automatically fulfilled during the course of your Ph.D. degree studies. You do not need to conduct two separate research projects (one for the M.S.E. degree, one for the Ph.D. degree) to obtain both degrees.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the Institution Code for reporting my scores to the University of Pennsylvania and Materials Science and Engineering?\n\n\n\n\nThe Institution Code for sending TOEFL and GRE scores to the University of Pennsylvania is 2888.\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes the department accept transfer students from other departments?\n\n\n\n\nYes, transfers from other departments are accepted, provided they meet the criteria set forth for all graduate students in the Materials Science and Engineering department. Transfer students are typically asked to include a letter of recommendation from a faculty member at their current school.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Do I Apply?\n\n\n\n\nThe following links provide information on the Graduate Application Process for the School of Engineering and Applied Science.\n\nHow to Apply: https://gradadm.seas.upenn.edu/how-to-apply/\nGrad Admissions FAQ: https://gradadm.seas.upenn.edu/faq/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter You Apply\n\n\n\nWhat factors are taken into account when evaluating my application?\n\n\n\n\nThe underlying question that needs to be answered by your application is, “Does this applicant have the potential to be a research scientist?” Your academic background is a large part of this question. If you have previous undergraduate or industrial research experience, it makes it easier for the evaluation committee to discern your research ability. Your letters of recommendation are also important since they are often written by professors and those who evaluate research ability. The content of the application should demonstrate that you have the potential to be a research scientist. If your application does this, then you should feel confident in you acceptance to the MSE Department at Penn Engineering.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens after I get accepted? When do I need to formally accept or decline an offer of admission?\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are a student in the U.S., you will be invited to visit Penn so that you can make a firsthand evaluation of whether Penn and the MSE Department are right for you. During the visit, you will speak with faculty and graduate students, receive a tour of both the department and the campus, and be treated to lunch at a local restaurant. Often, other activities can be planned with the graduate students, depending on the length of your stay. The MSE Department will reimburse you for your travel expenses. Visits by international applicants are not planned due to the complexities and costs of international travel.\nThe next step for you is to determine if you will accept the offer to conduct graduate studies at Penn. The official deadline for notifying the MSE Department with your decision is April 15.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a foreign student, I cannot visit Penn prior to making my decision. How can I learn more about the department?\n\n\n\n\nThe Materials Science and Engineering website contains a wealth of information about both the department and Penn Engineering.\nTo start, you can read the Welcome from our Department Chair and also visit the University website to learn more about Penn and Philadelphia.\n\n\n\n\n\nI received a letter of admission, but it didn't say anything about a research fellowship. Why is that?\n\n\n\n\nWhen you are accepted to the MSE Department at Penn (Ph.D. only), you will receive two (2) letters regarding your acceptance. The first letter concerns admissions and is sent from the School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS). The second letter concerns the research fellowship and is sent directly from the MSE Department.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost-Acceptance\n\n\n\nHow do I choose a research advisor, and what are the chances that I will be able to work with my advisor of choice?\n\n\n\n\nAny member of the MSE Graduate Group can serve as a research advisor. Students may already have an advisor at the time of admission. Even if you accepted our offer without a thesis advisor, you probably have an advisor or two in mind because they are likely one reason why you chose Penn and the MSE Department. You are encouraged to contact them or other potential advisors as soon as possible to make virtual or office appointments, and you may also want to speak with their graduate students or post-docs. This is to determine if there is a common interest and if the working environment is compatible with your expectations. Through this process you may finalize the advisor selection prior to arrival at Penn. If not, then you will complete the process on campus and submit to the Graduate Group Chair a ranked list of your top three advisors by October 1st of the first semester. In consultation with faculty, the Graduate Group Chair will determine which students will join which groups. The likelihood that you will be able to work with your highest ranked advisor is typically 100 percent.\n\n\n\n\n\nCan I \"pre-select\" a research advisor prior to my arrival at Penn?\n\n\n\n\nYes, see the answer to “How do I choose an advisor?” Again, students almost always get to work with their top-ranked advisor, so you shouldn’t have to worry about it too much.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do I do about finding a place to live?\n\n\n\n\nOne option is the University’s on-campus graduate student housing (https://www.graduateadmissions.upenn.edu/moving/housing/).

The University’s Office of Off-Campus Housing (http://cms.business-services.upenn.edu/offcampusservices/) is an invaluable resource if you decide to look for an apartment yourself. Talking with current graduate students would also be quite useful in your search.\nNo teaching or lab assistantship is required for the Ph.D. or M.S.E. degree programs. However, this option is often available for students who would like this experience.\nIssues, such as visas, concerning international students should be directed to the International Student and Scholar Services Office (215-898-4661).\n[GRID_TABLE]\nGraduate Program FAQ\nBefore You Apply\n\n\n\nWhom do I contact in the Materials Science and Engineering Department (MSE Department) at Penn with additional questions that are not addressed here?\n\n\n\n\nIrene Clements (ipc@seas.upenn.edu, 215-898-8337) is the Graduate Program Coordinator and is best person to contact. She can answer whatever questions you may have at any stage of the process.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf I want to get a master's degree (M.S.E. degree) as well as a Ph.D. degree, should I apply to the M.S.E. degree program or the Ph.D. degree program?\n\n\n\n\nYou should apply for the Ph.D. degree program. The requirements for the Ph.D. degree program supersede those for the M.S.E. degree program, thus the requirements for the master’s degree are automatically fulfilled during the course of your Ph.D. degree studies. You do not need to conduct two separate research projects (one for the M.S.E. degree, one for the Ph.D. degree) to obtain both degrees.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the Institution Code for reporting my scores to the University of Pennsylvania and Materials Science and Engineering?\n\n\n\n\nThe Institution Code for sending TOEFL and GRE scores to the University of Pennsylvania is 2888.\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes the department accept transfer students from other departments?\n\n\n\n\nYes, transfers from other departments are accepted, provided they meet the criteria set forth for all graduate students in the Materials Science and Engineering department. Transfer students are typically asked to include a letter of recommendation from a faculty member at their current school.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Do I Apply?\n\n\n\n\nThe following links provide information on the Graduate Application Process for the School of Engineering and Applied Science.\n\nHow to Apply: https://gradadm.seas.upenn.edu/how-to-apply/\nGrad Admissions FAQ: https://gradadm.seas.upenn.edu/faq/\nIrene Clements (ipc@seas.upenn.edu, 215-898-8337) is the Graduate Program Coordinator and is best person to contact.

If you have previous undergraduate or industrial research experience, it makes it easier for the evaluation committee to discern your research ability. Your letters of recommendation are also important since they are often written by professors and those who evaluate research ability. The content of the application should demonstrate that you have the potential to be a research scientist. If your application does this, then you should feel confident in you acceptance to the MSE Department at Penn Engineering.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens after I get accepted? When do I need to formally accept or decline an offer of admission?\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are a student in the U.S., you will be invited to visit Penn so that you can make a firsthand evaluation of whether Penn and the MSE Department are right for you. During the visit, you will speak with faculty and graduate students, receive a tour of both the department and the campus, and be treated to lunch at a local restaurant. Often, other activities can be planned with the graduate students, depending on the length of your stay. The MSE Department will reimburse you for your travel expenses. Visits by international applicants are not planned due to the complexities and costs of international travel.\nThe next step for you is to determine if you will accept the offer to conduct graduate studies at Penn. The official deadline for notifying the MSE Department with your decision is April 15.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a foreign student, I cannot visit Penn prior to making my decision. How can I learn more about the department?\n\n\n\n\nThe Materials Science and Engineering website contains a wealth of information about both the department and Penn Engineering.\nTo start, you can read the Welcome from our Department Chair and also visit the University website to learn more about Penn and Philadelphia.\n\n\n\n\n\nI received a letter of admission, but it didn't say anything about a research fellowship. Why is that?\n\n\n\n\nWhen you are accepted to the MSE Department at Penn (Ph.D. only), you will receive two (2) letters regarding your acceptance. The first letter concerns admissions and is sent from the School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS). The second letter concerns the research fellowship and is sent directly from the MSE Department.\nThe underlying question that needs to be answered by your application is, “Does this applicant have the potential to be a research scientist?” Your academic background is a large part of this question.

Students may already have an advisor at the time of admission. Even if you accepted our offer without a thesis advisor, you probably have an advisor or two in mind because they are likely one reason why you chose Penn and the MSE Department. You are encouraged to contact them or other potential advisors as soon as possible to make virtual or office appointments, and you may also want to speak with their graduate students or post-docs. This is to determine if there is a common interest and if the working environment is compatible with your expectations. Through this process you may finalize the advisor selection prior to arrival at Penn. If not, then you will complete the process on campus and submit to the Graduate Group Chair a ranked list of your top three advisors by October 1st of the first semester. In consultation with faculty, the Graduate Group Chair will determine which students will join which groups. The likelihood that you will be able to work with your highest ranked advisor is typically 100 percent.\n\n\n\n\n\nCan I \"pre-select\" a research advisor prior to my arrival at Penn?\n\n\n\n\nYes, see the answer to “How do I choose an advisor?” Again, students almost always get to work with their top-ranked advisor, so you shouldn’t have to worry about it too much.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do I do about finding a place to live?\n\n\n\n\nOne option is the University’s on-campus graduate student housing (https://www.graduateadmissions.upenn.edu/moving/housing/). This is probably the easiest option, but is usually more expensive than finding an off-campus apartment. The University’s Office of Off-Campus Housing (http://cms.business-services.upenn.edu/offcampusservices/) is an invaluable resource if you decide to look for an apartment yourself. Talking with current graduate students would also be quite useful in your search.\n\n\n\n\n\nAm I required to be a teaching or lab assistant as a graduate student in the MSE department?\n\n\n\n\nNo teaching or lab assistantship is required for the Ph.D. or M.S.E. degree programs. However, this option is often available for students who would like this experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a non-citizen of the U.S., what information do I need to know about visas?\n\n\n\n\nIssues, such as visas, concerning international students should be directed to the International Student and Scholar Services Office (215-898-4661).\nAny member of the MSE Graduate Group can serve as a research advisor.
