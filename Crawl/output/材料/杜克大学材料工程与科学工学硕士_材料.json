Here’s some advice:\nStart Now\nObtaining approval will probably take longer than you expect, so allow plenty of time.\nEvaluate Yourself\nDemonstrate motivation. Plan a career path within your organization. Identify the skills and knowledge you need to assume more responsibility. As you plan, anticipate concerns from your employer, such as:\n\nHow will you manage time away from the office?\nHow will costs be paid?\nHow will you continue to excel on the job?\nHow, and why, does a Duke master’s degree offer greater value than other programs? The answers are here\n\nDo Your Homework\nResearch your organization’s continuing education policy and its approval process. Discover when you should present your request.\nFor many organizations, the ideal time is before annual budgets are set.\nTalk to Others\nSpeak to colleagues who earned degrees while working. Ask them how their degrees advanced their careers. Ask managers in your company for advice on developing and presenting your request.\nAsk us to connect you with a recent Duke master’s graduate\nWrite a Formal Proposal\nPrepare a written request. Detail your motivations. Include a personal profile highlighting your accomplishments.\nPrepare to Negotiate\nThink through concessions you are willing to make. Include them in your proposal and be ready to discuss them in detail. Common points of negotiation include:\n\nForegoing raises or bonuses while in graduate school\nCommitting to staying with your company for a specified number of years. (A two-year commitment is common)\nFor online Master of Engineering programs, offering to use vacation days to attend the three required on-campus residencies\n• How will you manage time away from the office?\n• How will costs be paid?\n• How will you continue to excel on the job?\n• How, and why, does a Duke master’s degree offer greater value than other programs?

This information is submitted after admission and enrollment.\nGRE scores are optional for all 2025 applicants.\nEnglish language test scores, if you are an international applicant\nA video interview, if you are selected by our admissions team\nFor Master of Engineering, Master of Engineering Management and Graduate Certificates:\nApplicants must upload one (1) copy of a scanned unofficial transcript from each institution attended. Admitted applicants send official transcripts at the time of admission.\nOnce you have uploaded your file, click “View Document” to ensure that what you’ve uploaded is legible throughout.\nIf you cannot upload a legible unofficial transcript, you will be asked to have an official transcript mailed to Duke. Contact us for help. This is a variation of our standard process and will delay review of your application.\nApplicants from China and India may find these Transcript Guidelines helpful.\nIf requested, you must upload an image of the official scale your institution uses for grading.\nThe Grade Scale tells us what your grades mean. (You may also know this tool as the grading system, score system or percentage system.)\nThe scale should show differentiation between passing grades and indicate what is a failing grade. It should also explain other marks on your transcript, such as Withdrawal, Audit or Incomplete. It need not convert to a 4.0 scale.\nYour image might be the reverse side of your transcript, a screenshot of your registrar’s guidelines or an excerpt from your transcript.\nReverse of Transcript Example from a US Institution\nReverse of Transcript Example from an Indian Institution\nExcerpt from an Indian Institution\nScreenshot Example from a Chinese Institution\nExcerpt from Chinese Institution, in Both Chinese and English\nQuestions vary by degree program. Find your program and its short-answer essay questions below:\nPlease select one of these principles and explain how you hope to contribute and grow regarding that principle at Duke.\nWe require a resume highlighting experience, activities and leadership, whether in the classroom, in a volunteer setting, club or organization, or on the job. Work experience is not required for the campus program, but current undergraduates can focus on any internship experience.\nIf you have a preferred format, please use it. If you don’t, you might find it helpful to view sample resumes below from Duke students. Notice the kinds of information highlighted.\nGenerally, students with little experience should be able to get their resume down to a maximum of two pages.\nDegree applicants are required to provide three (3) letters of recommendation.\nApplicants for Graduate Certificate programs and non-degree applicants must provide two (2).\nRecommendations are submitted electronically via the online application.\nWhen you enter email addresses for your recommenders, they will receive a link to submit their letter of recommendation.\nLetters can be academic or professional. If you’re still a student, at least one should be academic. If you’re a working professional, it’s fine for all to be professional.\nWhen choosing academic recommendation providers, do not simply choose instructors who gave you the highest grades. Instead, consider selecting those who can give insight into your preparedness for a Duke Engineering master’s program.\nConsider providing an overview of the program, a copy of your resume and an understanding of your goals to your recommenders before you complete your application.\nYou may submit GRE scores if you feel the scores enhance your application.\nPlease know that if you send us scores:\nWhen sending scores to Duke, please indicate:\nPersonal copies are not acceptable, nor are “attested” or notarized copies.\nIt may take several weeks for ETS  to send us your scores. Plan to take the test or order prior scores at least one month prior to the deadline you seek.\nFor further information on the GRE, please visit gre.org\nWe receive GRE scores electronically from the ETS. Because we match scores by applicant name, it is important your name on the application and your name on your test scores be the same.\nIf not, you must contact us.\nPlease contact us if you are a candidate for a dual-degree program at Duke.\nInternational applicants must submit official test scores unless eligible for a waiver.\nAll international students may be required to take English placement exams before the start of classes, pending their language score submission provided in their application for admission to the Pratt School of Engineering.\nSubmitting Duolingo English Test scores will allow students to waive additional placement exams. Depending on placement results, students are either exempt from or placed into an English course. Students with English course requirements must make satisfactory progress toward completing these requirements while in the program.\nIt can take several weeks for scores to arrive, so plan to take the test or order prior scores at least one month before the deadline you seek.\nThe Duolingo English Test is the preferred language testing option.\nFor more information on the Duolingo English Test, visit englishtest.duolingo.com/applicants.\nPlus, Duolingo seamlessly integrates with your application to the Pratt School of Engineering. It provides a further dimension to your candidacy by allowing for video interviews and writing samples to be captured and viewed by the admissions committee. As such, if you do attend Pratt School of Engineering, you will not have to be additionally assessed for language classes when you submit a Duolingo English Test as part of your application.\nIf you opt to submit scores from other standardized assessments, you may be required to complete additional language testing upon acceptance into our programs.\nReport official scores and subscores:\nReport official scores to Institution Code 5156 (Duke University). There is no department code.\nReport official scores to “Duke University Pratt School of Engineering.”\nWe receive TOEFL scores electronically from the Educational Testing Service and IELTS results via mail from Cambridge ESOL, British Council, and IDP: IELTS Australia. Because we match scores by an applicant’s name, the name on the application and your test scores must be the same. If it is not, you must contact us.\nWe offer waivers of the English language testing requirement to:\nWaivers based on citizenship are automatic.\nIf you believe you qualify for a waiver based on the education or work criteria, indicate this and then answer the questions in the waiver section of your online application that require you to state where you completed the study or work requirement.\nDue to the volume of applications we receive, we will not examine, confirm the status of, or grant any waiver requests prior to extending an offer of admission.  If your request is not granted, we will notify you as soon as possible to give you time to take the test.  Therefore, it is in your best interest to apply in the earliest round for each admission cycle.\nAll international students may be required to take oral and written English placement exams administered at Duke prior to the start of classes.\nThese exams are independent of the score submission requirement.\nDepending on placement results, students are either exempt from, or placed into, English course(s). Students with English course requirements must make satisfactory progress toward completing these requirements while in the program.\nAn application fee of US $75 is required. You’ll pay it by credit card through the online application.\nApplication fee waivers are available, and many are automatic. If a request is required, it must be submitted before an application is submitted. Fees paid before a waiver is requested and confirmed cannot be refunded.\nYour application includes a required video introduction. We use it to get to know you better.\nYou’ll answer one question. A prompt will be shown, and you will have at least 60 seconds of preparation time. Use the question labeled “Pratt.”\nYou do not have to use all of the allotted time.\nYou may start over once, but the question will change. If you have multiple applications in our system, you may see multiple questions.\nUnlike many schools, Duke does not require financial support documents as part of the application; instead, students submit this information after they have been admitted and are enrolled in the program.\nDuke does not automatically issue I-20s to students upon admission.  Instead, students work with the department to submit information and supporting documents to Duke’s Visa Services Office. The process is described below.\nThose on non-Duke visas complete a modified process during the enrollment period.\n• Transcripts of your bachelor’s degree in engineering or science earned from an accredited institution. You may also be required to submit an estimated GPA and a grade scale\n• A resume\n• Responses to short essay questions\n• 3 Letters of recommendation\n• Application fee — Nonrefundable, paid by credit card\n• A video introduction\n• Go to Minimum Application Requirements\n• A video Introduction\n• Transcripts of your bachelor’s degree in engineering or science earned from an accredited institution. You may also be required to submit an estimated GPA and a grade scale\n• A resume\n• Responses to short essay questions\n• 2 Letters of recommendation\n• Application fee — Nonrefundable, paid by credit card\n• A video Introduction\n• There is no minimum GPA, GRE score or English language test score\n• No work experience is required, except for our 12-month-accelerated Master of Engineering programs\n• Illegible scans will not be accepted.
