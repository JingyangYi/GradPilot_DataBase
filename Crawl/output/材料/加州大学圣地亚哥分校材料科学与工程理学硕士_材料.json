Professor Buckingham serves as a PhD student mentor as well as performs important, informal advising and mentoring activities.\nBuckingham’s research focuses on ocean acoustic propagation, ambient noise in the marine environment, and acoustic imaging. His experiments involve the identification of objects in the ocean using naturally occurring sounds, produced as a result of bubbles forming near the surface. This system, described as “acoustic daylight” uses an experimental electronic imaging system that reveals objects in the ocean by listening to ambient underwater noise and displaying the objects as a simple video image. His recent theoretical research concerns sound and shear wave propagation through saturated granular materials, notably marine sediments. He is the recipient of several awards, including the A.B.

Applicants must complete the Cal State Apply Application as well as our Supplemental Program Application. Please refer to our How To Apply webpage for more details and application deadlines.\nApplications are reviewed by the JDP Selection subcommittee for each major area of study. After each file has been rated, each subcommittee meets with the overall selection chair to resolve any substantive discrepancies between raters. The Selection subcommittees carefully consider the application of a prospective student and make decisions based on the applicant’s interests, aptitude, prior achievements, grades, match with program offerings and potential mentors, and leadership/service. Please visit our webpage on What We Consider for a Competitive Application.\nIn early January, applications are then reviewed by the faculty members who are interested in taking a student. The faculty of each major area of study then meet to decide which applicants will be offered an interview. Typically 12-15 applicants from each major area of study are invited for an interview. Every attempt is made to make interview offers at least one month prior to the scheduled interview days. Typically, the two-day interviews are held in mid-February.\nOnce interviews have been completed, each major area selection subcommittee meets to determine which applicants will be made an offer of admission to the JDP. Offers are typically first made by the potential mentor by phone. Applicants must make their final decision by April 15.\n• About\n\nProgram Overview\nSDSU\nUC San Diego\nEquity & Diversity\n\nDiversity Statement\nJDP Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (JEDI)

The interdisciplinary field of translational medicine unites research and practices within the pillars of what the European Society for Translational Medicine defines as the “benchside, bedside and community” to develop new, patient-centered approaches that enhance worldwide healthcare. Merkin Graduate Fellows will work with researchers and clinicians at academic and industry sites across the US and the globe with the goal of driving bold, transformational advances in medical research and clinical applications, and at the same time impact the Fellows’ personal and professional futures.\nMerkin Graduate Fellows will have the unique opportunity to design their own research experience, proposing the length of the experience of between 3 and 6 months and the  site(s) at which they will conduct their research. Applicants may propose to work at an institution with which they or their PI/faculty advisor have an existing relationship, or they may propose to work collaboratively with the Merkin Fellowship Program Manager and their PI/faculty advisor to build a new connection that will facilitate their research at that site. Students may submit a proposal for an individual research away experience or may propose to participate in the program as part of a group of other eligible applicants.\nMerkin Graduate Fellows receive a monthly stipend of $5,000, funding for (one) round-trip airfare to their research destination, and tuition and fee coverage for the duration of their fellowship period. Fellows will be expected to provide regular updates on their research progress and education experience.\nFor more details, please contact: Carrie Daly, Merkin Fellowship Program Manager.\nRead more about the Merkin Graduate Fellows Program and our Fellows' travel adventures\nFor more information about the program and to hear from our Fellows about their tips and experiences, view our webinar:\nThe Merkin Graduate Fellows Program accepts applications from eligible PhD and MD-PhD students whose research aims to improve human health and longevity, including fields broadly related to translational medicine. Applications are encouraged for eligible students across a wide array of disciplines, including but not limited to graduate programs in the following school and institutes: School of Biological Sciences, School of Medicine, Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Herbert Wertheim School of Public Health, Scripps Institution of Oceanography, Jacobs School of Engineering, School of Physical Sciences, and Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute.\nFellows must be registered UC San Diego PhD or MD-PhD graduate students and must also be in good academic standing (GPA of 3.0 or above). For In Absentia eligibility, typically PhD/MD-PhD students must have advanced to candidacy by the time their travel would commence. However, exceptions to this policy can be considered.\nIf proposing a group research experience (such as among multiple students from one lab who wish to travel together to the same destination), all applicants must be eligible UC San Diego students and submit their own application. Faculty advisors/PIs may submit individual letters of recommendation for each applicant or provide one letter for the group which addresses each student's qualifications.\nApplications will be reviewed by a committee of interdisciplinary faculty from UC San Diego with expertise in research broadly related to translational medicine. Fellows will be selected based on the following criteria:\nMerkin Graduate Fellows will be expected to maintain satisfactory progress with their research and devote their full time to research on the approved topic. Fellows must also maintain regular contact with the Program Manager as well as participate in cohort virtual meetings while away. Fellows will be expected to submit a 2-page report outlining: a) the progress they made on the goals set forth in their proposals; and b) the impact of their experience living abroad or outside Southern California on the quality of their research and the field of translational medicine, as well as on their personal and professional development.\nThe Merkin Graduate Fellows Program award is subject to certain terms and conditions that Fellows will need to agree to upon acceptance of their award.\n*The above are estimates; ranges vary considerably depending on the country you are traveling to and your proposed length of stay. Please note that visa and passport processing may take longer for international students.\nIn accordance with applicable Federal and State law and University policy, the University of California does not discriminate, or grant preferences, on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, disability, and/or other protected categories. All programs and initiatives coordinated by the University of California Division of Graduate Education and Postdoctoral Affairs are designed and implemented in full compliance with Proposition 209 and the University of California Anti-Discrimination Policy.\nMore information about Proposition 209 can be found here.\nMore information about the University of California Anti-Discrimination Policy can be found here.\n• Search\n\nThis Site\nAll UCSD Sites\nFaculty/Staff\n\n\nSearch Term\n• About  \n\nOur Impact\nMeet the Dean\nMeet the Team\nProfessors of the Graduate Division\nAlumni & Friends\nGrad Data\nContact\nGet Help\n• Our Impact\n• Meet the Dean\n• Meet the Team\n• Professors of the Graduate Division\n• Alumni & Friends\n• Grad Data\n• Contact\n• Get Help\n• Admissions  \n\nProspective Students\nDegree Programs\nRequirements\nAdmitted Students\nAdmission FAQ\nCompliance/Health and Safety Information\n• Prospective Students\n• Degree Programs\n• Requirements\n• Admitted Students\n• Admission FAQ\n• Compliance/Health and Safety Information\n• Financial Support  \n\nTuition & Fees\nFellowships\nEmployment\nThird-Party Payments\nNon-UC Visiting Grads\nFinancial Support FAQ\nNews & Updates\n• Tuition & Fees\n• Fellowships\n• Employment\n• Third-Party Payments\n• Non-UC Visiting Grads\n• Financial Support FAQ\n• News & Updates\n• Academics  \n\nProgress to Degree\nEnrolling at UC San Diego\nPreparing to Graduate\nPolicies & Procedures\nStudent Academic FAQ\nMerkin Graduate Fellows Program\n• Progress to Degree\n• Enrolling at UC San Diego\n• Preparing to Graduate\n• Policies & Procedures\n• Student Academic FAQ\n• Merkin Graduate Fellows Program\n• Student Life  \n\nEvents\nHealth & Wellbeing\nProfessional Development\nStudent Spotlights\n• Events\n• Health & Wellbeing\n• Professional Development\n• Student Spotlights\n• OAR²  \n\nOffice of OAR²\nPrograms and Resources\nGEPA Awards\n• Office of OAR²\n• Programs and Resources\n• GEPA Awards\n• Postdoctoral Affairs\n• Apply\n• Our Impact\n• Meet the Dean\n• Meet the Team\n• Professors of the Graduate Division\n• Alumni & Friends\n• Grad Data\n• Contact\n• Get Help\n• Prospective Students\n• Degree Programs\n• Requirements\n• Admitted Students\n• Admission FAQ\n• Compliance/Health and Safety Information\n• Tuition & Fees\n• Fellowships\n• Employment\n• Third-Party Payments\n• Non-UC Visiting Grads\n• Financial Support FAQ\n• News & Updates\n• Progress to Degree\n• Enrolling at UC San Diego\n• Preparing to Graduate\n• Policies & Procedures\n• Student Academic FAQ\n• Merkin Graduate Fellows Program\n• Events\n• Health & Wellbeing\n• Professional Development\n• Student Spotlights\n• Office of OAR²\n• Programs and Resources\n• GEPA Awards\n• HOME\n• Academics\n• Merkin Graduate Fellows Program\n• Merkin Graduate Fellows Program Application Form\n• CV\n• Research proposal (max. 3 pages) describing the research to be performed, desired research site, length of education away (3 or 6 months), and project deliverable the applicant expects to achieve during their time away.

The interdisciplinary field of translational medicine unites research and practices within the pillars of what the European Society for Translational Medicine defines as the “benchside, bedside and community” to develop new, patient-centered approaches that enhance worldwide healthcare. Merkin Graduate Fellows will work with researchers and clinicians at academic and industry sites across the US and the globe with the goal of driving bold, transformational advances in medical research and clinical applications, and at the same time impact the Fellows’ personal and professional futures.\nMerkin Graduate Fellows will have the unique opportunity to design their own research experience, proposing the length of the experience of between 3 and 6 months and the  site(s) at which they will conduct their research. Applicants may propose to work at an institution with which they or their PI/faculty advisor have an existing relationship, or they may propose to work collaboratively with the Merkin Fellowship Program Manager and their PI/faculty advisor to build a new connection that will facilitate their research at that site. Students may submit a proposal for an individual research away experience or may propose to participate in the program as part of a group of other eligible applicants.\nMerkin Graduate Fellows receive a monthly stipend of $5,000, funding for (one) round-trip airfare to their research destination, and tuition and fee coverage for the duration of their fellowship period. Fellows will be expected to provide regular updates on their research progress and education experience.\nFor more details, please contact: Carrie Daly, Merkin Fellowship Program Manager.\nRead more about the Merkin Graduate Fellows Program and our Fellows' travel adventures\nFor more information about the program and to hear from our Fellows about their tips and experiences, view our webinar:\n\n\n\n\nEligibility\n\n\nThe Merkin Graduate Fellows Program accepts applications from eligible PhD and MD-PhD students whose research aims to improve human health and longevity, including fields broadly related to translational medicine.

The next application deadline will be in July, 2025.  Please apply via the Merkin Graduate Fellows Program Application Form. \n\n\nCan my faculty advisor submit a nomination for me?\n\nPIs/faculty advisors may nominate prospective applicants they believe would be a good fit for the program by submitting a nomination form. However, an application submitted by the student is required for consideration for the program; nominees will be contacted by the Merkin Fellowship Program Manager to encourage them to apply.\n\n\nHow do I determine when I should apply and when I should propose to begin my travel if I am selected as a Merkin Graduate Fellow?\n\nMake sure to apply well in advance of, and at minimum one full quarter before, your proposed travel dates. In determining the proposed quarter in which to travel, please account for additional time needed for logistics such as obtaining a visa if traveling abroad and other research documentation, and arranging to sublet your housing if you choose to do so (see estimates on a few examples below). Applications will be rated more favorably if there is ample time for the applicant to prepare for their experience abroad.\n\n\n\n \n*The above are estimates; ranges vary considerably depending on the country you are traveling to and your proposed length of stay. Please note that visa and passport processing may take longer for international students.\n\nWhat duration of time should I propose for my research experience? Can I go at any time of year, including the summer?\n\nFunding is provided for one or two full quarters (three to six months). Fellows should endeavor to align their travel with the start and end of their funded quarter(s), and may travel during the academic year and/or the summer.\n\n\nCan I choose a research location in California?\n\nYes. However, the research location must be outside the following counties in California: Los Angeles County, Orange County, Riverside County, Imperial County, and San Bernardino County.\n\n\nHow do I know that my application has been received? \n\nAll submissions on the application website will be directed to the Merkin Fellowship Program Manager, and you will receive a confirmation message upon submitting your application. If you do not receive this after clicking “Submit,” or have other questions about your application, you may reach out to the Merkin Fellowship Program Manager at merkinfellowship@ucsd.edu. \n\n\nWhat documents are required for a complete application?\n\nApplicants must submit an application form, their CV, research proposal, and a letter of support from their PI/faculty mentor for an application to be considered complete. Examples of an academic CV template can be found in the NIH OITE's handbook. Including a letter of support from your proposed host research mentor is optional, but would strengthen your application. \n\n\nCan more than one student (such as from the same lab) propose a group research experience?\n\nStudents may propose either individual or group research experiences for the Merkin Graduate Fellows Program. For group proposals, all applicants must be eligible UC San Diego students and each student must submit their own application form, CV, and research proposal. Faculty advisors/PIs may submit individual letters of recommendation for each applicant or provide one letter for the group that speaks to each applicant's qualifications.\n\n\nAre there any resources available to me as I’m writing my application?\n\nThe Writing Hub offers writing workshops and individual consultations, where they can help you with any stage of your writing process and provide feedback on your documents. You can learn more about their resources for graduate students and book a consultation on their website.\nA sample Merkin Fellowship research proposal is available upon request; please reach out to merkinfellowship@ucsd.edu. \n\n\nHow can I find an institution or research collaborator to host me as I conduct my research? Can I do research away without a host affiliation?\n\nAll Fellows must have a host country and specific host site identified. The proposed host site may vary and can include universities, laboratories, policy-making organizations, industry, etc.\nApplicants may propose to work at an academic or industry site with which they or their PI have an existing relationship. In this case, prior to submitting your application, you should contact the potential hosting research mentor to discuss the proposed work and receive confirmation of their support to host you for this opportunity.\nAlternately, applicants may create a new research partnership in collaboration with your PI/faculty mentor. Conducting a search of existing agreements UC San Diego has with international universities and other organizations on the International Agreements Database may provide some ideas on institutions you may want to partner with. The Merkin Fellowship Program Manager can provide support to you and your PI/faculty mentor in establishing this new research partnership.\n\n\nCan I apply if I will have graduated by the time my travel will commence? \n\nStudents who will have had their degrees conferred prior to their proposed date of travel are ineligible for this program.\n\n\nI am an MD-PhD student and have completed the PhD portion of my degree, but not the MD. Am I eligible?\n\nAt this time, MSTP students are only eligible when enrolled in the PhD portion of the program. \n\n\nWhat research policies and procedures should I consider as I plan my proposal?\n\nFellows are responsible for following regulations and applicable policies specific to their proposed host site/country, including but not limited to research ethics, intellectual property, and confidentiality practices. It is strongly recommended that you research these guidelines early on, as some procedural arrangements and agreements can take time to secure.\nGeneral information, policies, and resources on conducting research abroad can be found on the university’s International Research and Engagement page. \nThe Office of Innovation and Commercialization provides Guidelines for Conducting International Research with regard to patent and intellectual property protections. If you anticipate any new intellectual property arising from your proposed research abroad experience, or an invention disclosure needs to be submitted for a project you will continue abroad, please contact the OIC.\nIf there will be any material transfers taking place, you must work with your PI/faculty advisor to secure a  Material Transfer Agreement prior to your departure/transfer of materials.\nIf your project will involve human subjects, you must work with your PI/faculty advisor to obtain IRB approval prior to your departure and remain in compliance with IRB regulations as stipulated by the UC San Diego Office of IRB Administration. \nMake sure to review Export Control suggestions and contact their office if their review will be needed.\nIf your proposed site is in private industry, please review the university’s Conflict of Interest policies for graduate students and provide any necessary disclosures.\nIf you anticipate a co-authored publication arising from the research you propose to conduct at the host institution, it is recommended that you create a written authorship agreement with the proposed research mentor early in the process, ideally before your travel commences.\n\n\nI don’t have a passport for travel abroad. Can I still apply?\n\nYes, you are still eligible to apply. However, it can take several months for the State Department to process passport applications, so we recommend that if you need to renew your passport or apply for a new one, you propose a timeline for travel that includes a departure date that is at least 5 months from your planned application submission date. In order to commence travel, awardees must have a passport that will remain valid for at least 6 months plus the total travel time (e.g. if you are proposing a 3 month experience abroad, your passport must not expire for at least 9 months after your departure date).\n\n\nCan I travel domestically in the US if I don't have a REAL ID?\n\nAs of May 7, 2025, state-issued driver’s licenses and IDs that are not REAL ID compliant are no longer accepted as valid forms of identification at airports. Passengers should either travel with an acceptable alternative form of ID, like a passport, or enroll for a state-issued REAL ID through their state DMV offices.\n\n\nI applied for a Merkin Graduate Fellowship previously and was not selected. Can I apply again?\n\nYes, you may apply to the Merkin Graduate Fellows Program again, as long as you continue to meet the Fellowship eligibility requirements. It is recommended that you meet with the Merkin Fellowship Program Manager prior to reapplying so that you can get feedback on strengthening your application.\n\n\n\nFunding\n\nWhat kinds of proposals will be funded? \n\nCompetitive research proposals will focus on a topic broadly related to translational medicine and clearly specify the ways in which conducting this research at the desired site will enhance the applicant’s contributions to the field as well as their intellectual, personal, and professional growth.\n\n\nHow much funding does the program provide? \n\nA stipend award of $5,000/month for a fellowship term of 3 to 6 months will be provided and is intended to cover all expenses directly related and essential to the proposed research experience, including travel and living costs. The fellowship award will also include funding for the departure and return flight to the destination. In Absentia tuition and fees will be paid directly by the fellowship. The Merkin Graduate Fellowship stipend counts as taxable income and must be reported to the IRS.\n\n\nIs any additional funding available for Fellows?\n\nWhile the fellowship award is intended to cover costs associated with travel and living expenses during the research experience, cost of living variations per capita and/or other exceptional circumstances may occasionally justify an increase in the stipend level. If your proposed research abroad experience has exceptional costs, you may provide a detailed justification on your application for consideration of a higher stipend level above the default award package.\n\n\nMay I participate in the Merkin Graduate Fellows Program if I am already supported by funding from an external training grant or other fellowship/grant funding?\n\nPlease check with your/your PI's funding agency regarding any policies that may be in place determining whether you can accept the Merkin Graduate Fellows Program award. We also recommend you contact the Merkin Fellowship Program Manager to discuss.\n\n\n\nInternational Students\n\nCan international students apply? \n\nYes, international graduate students are eligible for the Merkin Graduate Fellows Program.\n\n\nWhat steps should I take if I am an international student and plan to apply to the Merkin Graduate Fellows Program? \n\nInternational students are encouraged to begin preparing early if they are interested in conducting research abroad as a Merkin Graduate Fellow, and should discuss their plans with an advisor at the International Students & Programs Office. ISEO has additional information on how international students should prepare to study abroad on their website.\n\n\n\nOther Considerations\n\nI have a disability.
