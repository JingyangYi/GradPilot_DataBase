However, the University has been involved in teacher education since 1917, and to this day it remains a major provider of teacher education in Hong Kong.The Faculty is forward-looking. It has assumed an important role in educational research and professional training in the region and internationally, and has contributed significantly to education policy and development in Hong Kong. It is a major teacher-education institution and has strong expertise in policy analysis and curriculum development. It became the first institution in Hong Kong to train speech therapists and audiologists for the local community.The Faculty is committed to building its expertise and has strengthened its capacity by recruiting diverse, highly qualified scholars and students internationally. Our scholars come from many different parts of the world, including North America, Europe, Asia (Central, South, South-East and East, including Hong Kong and Mainland China) and Australasia. The Faculty has more than 100 full-time academic staff, many of whom are very well known internationally. In addition to performing teaching duties, academic staff engage in an extensive range of research and they lead both local and international projects. Many of our colleagues sit on advisory committees contributing to the formulation of policies related to local and international education.

Education (the Faculty) was established in The University of Hong Kong in 1984, having previously been a department in the Faculty of Arts and then a School of Education. However, the University has been involved in teacher education since 1917, and to this day it remains a major provider of teacher education in Hong Kong.The Faculty is forward-looking. It has assumed an important role in educational research and professional training in the region and internationally, and has contributed significantly to education policy and development in Hong Kong. It is a major teacher-education institution and has strong expertise in policy analysis and curriculum development. It became the first institution in Hong Kong to train speech therapists and audiologists for the local community.The Faculty is committed to building its expertise and has strengthened its capacity by recruiting diverse, highly qualified scholars and students internationally. Our scholars come from many different parts of the world, including North America, Europe, Asia (Central, South, South-East and East, including Hong Kong and Mainland China) and Australasia. The Faculty has more than 100 full-time academic staff, many of whom are very well known internationally. In addition to performing teaching duties, academic staff engage in an extensive range of research and they lead both local and international projects. Many of our colleagues sit on advisory committees contributing to the formulation of policies related to local and international education. With the diverse staff and student body, the Faculty maintains high academic and research standards, and has a reputation as an international centre of excellence.\r\n                                        \n\n\nFaculty Website\r\n                                            \n\nProgramme Website\nContact Info\n\n\n\r\n                                                    3917 2544\r\n                                                \n\n\n\r\n                                                        pgdedu@hku.hk\r\n                                                    \n\n\n\n\r\n                                                        https://web.edu.hku.hk/programme/pgde\r\n                                                    \n\n\n\r\n                                                    2858 5649\n[GRID_TABLE]\nFaculty of Education\r\n                                        \n\r\n                                            Postgraduate Diploma in Education (Teaching Chinese as a Second Language)\r\n                                        \n\nPGDE(TCSL)\nFull-time\nFaculty of Education\r\n                                        \n\r\n                                            Master of Arts in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages\r\n                                        \n\nMA(TESOL)\nFull-time",
