Admission to most ANU programs is on a competitive basis. Therefore, meeting all admission requirements does not automatically guarantee entry.\nApplicants must present a Bachelor degree or international equivalent in a cognate discipline with a minimum GPA of 5.0/7.0, with at least one course in the field of mathematics that must cover calculus and linear algebra.\nApplicants with an ANU Graduate Certificate (with four Statistics/Mathematics courses) with a GPA of 4.0/7.0, with at least one course in the field of mathematics from university studies that must cover calculus and linear algebra.\nIn line with the university's admissions policy and strategic plan, an assessment for admission may include competitively ranking applicants on the basis of specific academic achievement, English language proficiency and diversity factors. However, applicants will first be ranked on a GPA ('GPA1') that is calculated using all but the last semester (or equivalent) of the Bachelor degree used for admission purposes.\nIf required, ranking may further be confirmed on the basis of:\n• a GPA ('GPA2') calculated on the penultimate and antepenultimate semesters (or equivalent) of the Bachelor degree used for admission purposes; and/or\n• demonstrating higher-level English language proficiency.\nPrior to enrolment in this ANU program, all students who gain entry will have their Bachelor degree reassessed, to confirm minimum requirements were met.\nFurther information: English Language Requirements for Admission\nDiversity factors\nAs Australia’s national university, ANU is global representative of Australian research and education. ANU endeavours to recruit and maintain a diverse and deliberate student cohort representative not only of Australia, but the world. In order to achieve these outcomes, competitive ranking of applicants may be adjusted to ensure access to ANU is a reality for brilliant students from countries across the globe.\nAssessment of qualifications\nUnless otherwise indicated, ANU will accept all Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF) qualifications or international equivalents that meet or exceed the published admission requirements of our programs, provided all other admission requirements are also met.\nWhere an applicant has more than one completed tertiary qualification, ANU will base assessment on the qualification that best meets the admission requirements for the program. Find out more about the Australian Qualifications Framework: www.aqf.edu.au\nANU uses a 7-point Grade Point Average (GPA) scale. All qualifications submitted for admission at ANU will be converted to this common scale, which will determine if an applicant meets our published admission requirements. Find out more about how a 7-point GPA is calculated for Australian universities: www.uac.edu.au/future-applicants/admission-criteria/tertiary-qualifications\nUnless otherwise indicated, where an applicant has more than one completed tertiary qualification, ANU will calculate the GPA for each qualification separately. ANU will base assessment on the best GPA of all completed tertiary qualifications of the same level or higher.\nApplicants may be eligible for up to 24 units (one semester) of credit for courses completed towards an incomplete AQF Level 9 or above qualification.\nAccounting, Actuarial Studies, Business, Commerce, Data Science, Economics, Finance, Health Sciences, Information Technology, Management, Marketing, Mathematics, Medicine, Public Administration, Science, Statistics.\nDomestic Tuition Fees (DTF)\nFor more information see: http://www.anu.edu.au/students/program-administration/costs-fees\nFor further information on International Tuition Fees see: https://www.anu.edu.au/students/program-administration/fees-payments/international-tuition-fees\nAll students are required to pay the Services and amenities fee (SA Fee)\nThe annual indicative fee provides an estimate of the program tuition fees for international students and domestic students (where applicable). The annual indicative fee for a program is based on the standard full-time enrolment load of 48 units per year (unless the program duration is less than 48 units). Fees for courses vary by discipline meaning that the fees for a program can vary depending on the courses selected. Course fees are reviewed on an annual basis and typically will increase from year to year. The tuition fees payable are dependent on the year of commencement and the courses selected and are subject to increase during the period of study.\nFor further information on Fees and Payment please see: https://www.anu.edu.au/students/program-administration/fees-payments\nANU offers a wide range of scholarships to students to assist with the cost of their studies.\nEligibility to apply for ANU scholarships varies depending on the specifics of the scholarship and can be categorised by the type of student you are.  Specific scholarship application process information is included in the relevant scholarship listing.\nFor further information see the Scholarships website.\nIn disciplines as diverse as biology, economics, actuarial studies, psychology, physics, archaeology, medicine and information technology, there is always a need for qualified statisticians to make proper sense of the data. The Master of Statistical Data Analysis will provide you with a rigorous training in core statistical application and theory. This will set you up as a professional statistician whose services will be highly sought-after.

Prerequisites can include a high school subject or a university unit of study, which would be required to study that program or course in a program.\nThis is a grouping of schools according to academic disciplines, where academic staff teach at undergraduate, graduate and higher degree levels and pursue research and scholarly investigations.\nThey are University approved accommodation.  To find out more, visit the Residential and Campus Communities website.\nAustralian Tertiary Admissions Rank. The figure used by universities and tertiary applications centres such as UAC/VTAC to calculate the university entrance rank.This is then used to determine eligibility for admission to undergraduate courses. This is not a mark, but rank in comparison to other students.\nAn area within a program that allows in-depth study in a particular field. A major usually consists of a set number of related courses. Majors at ANU require 48 units.Example: The Marketing Major requires 48 units of courses specified under the requirements for the Marketing Major.\nA minor has fewer requirements to fulfil than a major, in terms of points and compulsory courses. Minors at ANU require 24 units.Example: The French Minor requires 24 units of courses specified under the requirements for the French Minor.\nSimilar to minors, specialisations are areas of studies with their own courses that are allowed to be taken in conjunction with a specific related major.Example: The Astronomy and Astrophysics specialisation requires 24 units of courses and is available to students who complete a Physics Major, Theoretical Physics Major, Mathematics Major or Mathematical Modelling Major.\nAn optional area of study selected in addition to the core courses of the program. Electives may allow you to delve more deeply into an area of study, or focus on an alternative area of interest that you may have. Many people will use electives to complete an additional major or minor.\nEach university has different terminology to describe their programs and the specific requirements of those programs. Some of these terms are “units”, “subjects” and “courses”, and whilst some terms are interchangeable, at ANU there is a general understanding of what these terms mean:>> Course: An area of study usually of one semester in length. Each course is normally assigned a unit value.Example: COMP1100 Introduction to Programming and Algorithms.>> Unit: a unit is an indicator of the value of a course – most courses are valued at 6 units.\nSome institutions assume that you have knowledge of specified courses or equivalent before beginning your course. If you do not have the assumed level of knowledge, but have met the admission requirements you may still be selected for the course, but you may have some difficulty coping with your studies. You may need to do a bridging course if you do not have the assumed level of knowledge.\nThese courses are designed to help you to get up to speed if you lack the assumed knowledge to start your program. They offer students the opportunity to revise and extend their knowledge in specific areas – often in chemistry, mathematics and physics. While they are strongly recommended for commencing students, they are not prerequisites.\nResponsible Officer: Registrar, Student Administration / Page Contact: Website Administrator / Frequently Asked Questions\n• Search ANU web, staff & maps\n\nSearch current site content\n• Search current site content\n• Programs and Courses\n• Frequently Asked Questions",

Clauses 48–51 will be repeated until the request is either approved or not approved.\n• If two approvals are received, Admissions (for coursework programs) or Graduate Research Office (for HDR programs) will make the offer or force the offer in the UAC system.\n• The decision is final and as a Case for English Language Equivalency may not be made by an applicant it may not be appealed.\n• For each student admitted under a Case for English Language Equivalency, the Associate Dean making the Case is to appoint:\n• for coursework students, either the Convenor of the Student’s program, or the Deputy Director (Education) or equivalent of the relevant Research School (or equivalent); or\n• for Higher Degree by Research Students, either the thesis supervisor or the Deputy Director (HDR) or equivalent of the relevant Research School (or equivalent)\n• Where proficiency in English needed to participate in the student’s study is not demonstrated, remedial English courses are to be arranged by the area at no cost to the student. The College is required to cover relevant costs associated with English language tuition.\n• When proficiency in English needed to participate in the student’s study has been demonstrated, the Associate Dean will inform either the Secretary to the Academic Quality Assurance Committee or the Secretary to the Higher Degree Reserach Committee in writing. The College is no longer required to source or fund further English language tuition once the Secretary has been informed.\n• An annual report is to be prepared for AQAC, HDRC, and Academic Board categorising Cases for English Language Equivalency by School and College, by cohort (undergraduate, postgraduate coursework, higher degree by research), by student demographic, and by type of evidence used. The report should consider the marks and grades, or work on the thesis, of each student, and a report from the staff member who is monitoring their progress.\n• The demonstration of the requisite English language proficiency to undertake tertiary education is critical to the student’s ability to develop academic literacy, that is, to acquire and competently deploy the specialised language, argumentation, and referencing conventions of discipline-specific discourse.\n• Based on their performance in the post-entry language assessment, students are directed to the appropriate available resources for developing their academic literacy and English language proficiency.\n• Students take responsibility for making use of these resources, which cover academic literacy development and English language support.\n• The requirements specified in this policy are minimum requirements that will be adopted University wide. An evidence-based case for a higher level of English language ability for entry can be made for individual programs.\n• An annual report covering the previous calendar year is to be prepared by the Planning and Service Performance Division. The report will use post-entry language assessment data and progression and retention data to analyse each of the English language admission requirements including achieved scores in instances where the policy specifies a minimum score. The report is provided to the Academic Quality Assurance Committee at its second meeting each year. At that meeting, the Committee will consider the report and recommend any changes to this policy to Academic Board.\n• English language tests, English language programs, Foundation programs, and other pathway programs (excluding Secondary School qualifications) must demonstrate that they meet at a minimum the principles and criteria set out in Table 10 before they can be considered for inclusion in this policy. Provided data will be used to determine the initial achievement levels (including sub-bands where appropriate); these levels will be quality assured by and may be adjusted based on PELA data.\n• The English Language Test quality assurance principles are:\n• The test measures academic English language proficiency.\n• The tasks and scoring methods represent similar tasks, skills and values to those of the academic domain.\n• The test provider has a validation agenda which examines the accuracy and appropriateness of scoring, the test’s fit-for-purpose for the academic domain, and the impact of the test. The validation research is available.\n• The test generates preparation activities that develop academic English.\n• The test measures four skills (reading, writing, speaking, listening).\n• The test levels are representative of the range of English language proficiencies relevant to the ANU applicant pool.\n• The Standard Error of Measurement (SEm) is acceptable at score decision points, i.e., the minimum required score for entry to a program.\n• The test is reliable and publishes information about its internal properties.\n• The test is secure.\n• The test is not biased against any applicant groups.\n• There is a sound empirical basis for the score equivalences claimed.\n• Equivalences are based on considerations of construct congruence as well as correlational strength.\n• At least one of the tests is accessible in terms of technology, geography and any accommodations required for inclusive testing.\n• In rare circumstances, exceptions may apply to Principles 1 to 4 for reasons of inclusivity and access.\n• The Program quality assurance principles are:\n• Criteria for evaluation:\n• The curriculum and learning outcomes focus centrally on the domain of English-medium university study;\n• The program offers a rich and relevant learning experience;\n• The summative assessments capture a robust sample of relevant academic English language and literacy skills, including oral and listening skills;\n• Scoring and rating processes and levels (summative assessments) prioritise aspects of English language ability that are relevant to English-medium university study; and\n• Any use of external examinations is well justified in relation to the course outcomes.\n• Providers supply:\n• Relevant curriculum overviews and learning outcomes;\n• Structure and time allocation for the program, including time spend in class and mode of class delivery (e.g., in-person, online);\n• Specifications for summative assessments demonstrating the evidence base for academic English proficiency; and\n• Sample summative assessments (e.g., practice test papers) and descriptions/samples of assessment components (e.g., task description, use of input texts, approach to AI and technology assistance at task level, marking criteria, assessment conditions and timing).\n• Criteria for evaluation:\n• The assessments are reliable and consistently administered with marking moderation processes in place;\n• The assessments are secure and there are procedures in place for monitoring academic integrity, including the use of AI tools;\n• The Standard Error of Measurement (SEM) is acceptable at the minimum required score for entry to a university program;\n• If machine scoring/rating is used, it is combined with human monitoring (for objective scoring) and human rating (for subjective scoring). Any use of AI in the assessment and marking process should be well documented and transparent;\n• Final grades are based on independent work (i.e., not group marks); and\n• Teaching/assessing staff are well qualified.\n• Providers supply auditable evidence on the following:\n• Descriptions of regular marking processes for all summative tasks, including regular moderation, co-marking, or other procedures;\n• Procedures for keeping summative assessment materials and administrations secure;\n• Expectations regarding the independence of summative assessments including expectations about the use of technological assistance in summative assessments, and the ways that this is monitored, and the extent of any collaborative assessment performances;\n• Procedures for educating about and monitoring academic integrity;\n• Reliability statistics and item statistics for summative assessments;\n• Details of human and machine scoring methods; and\n• Recruitment criteria for relevant staff.\n• Criteria for evaluation:\n• There is a sound empirical basis for the relationship between program grades and university English language entrance requirements; and\n• If external, standardised tests are used as summative assessments, these have robust and evidence-based equivalences to university entrance requirements.\n• Providers supply:\n• Documentation about benchmarking with external tests and/or university entrance standard-setting procedures;\n• Tracking studies showing pathway college students’ performances once at university; and\n• Evidence of equivalence of any external tests used to university entrance requirements.\n• The Institutional quality assurance criteria are: \n\nthe provider must be on, or must be a wholly-owned subsidiary of a provider on, at least one of the:\n\nCommonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students (CRICOS);National Register of Higher Education Providers in accordance with the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency Act 2011 (TEQSA Act);\nthe program must be entirely taught in a Group A County (see Table 3);

the initial achievement level in English will be the same as that set by that university.\n• Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students (CRICOS);\n• National Register of Higher Education Providers in accordance with the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency Act 2011 (TEQSA Act);\n• Where an English Language Test, English Language Program, Foundation Program, or Other Program is to be considered for addition to this policy, the Pro Vice-Chancellor (Academic Quality) requests the relevant organisation to provide evidence that the test or program meets the relevant Principles and Criteria; however, institutional criteria may be determined from published sources and not requested from the institution. The Pro Vice-Chancellor (Academic Quality) seeks written advice from at least two academic experts in the field of English language testing based on the evidence provided and on Test Principle 5. The Pro Vice-Chancellor (Academic Quality) prepares a case for consideration by the Academic Quality Assurance Committee for endorsement for transmission to Academic Board for approval.\n• Where a Government declares an emergency situation that prevents or makes it difficult for applicants to access the tests listed in this policy, Academic Board may approve, for the duration of that emergency only, tests that do not meet these principles for applicants impacted by that emergency. Such tests must be included in appendices to the Tables.\n• Each Secondary-School Qualification, English language test, English language program, Foundation program, or Other program is accredited for inclusion for a maximum period of five years. A case for reaccreditation must be made for each program; the case must include consideration of post-entry language assessment data and student progression and retention data. The Pro Vice-Chancellor (Academic Quality) may call an earlier review of a qualification or program based on the results of the annual reporting of post-entry language assessment data and student progression and retention data.\n• Where a test or program states that it is only accepted if it was “completed before” or “commenced before” a specified date, it is not subject to ongoing review past that date.\n• This version of the policy applies to applications for enrolment to commence study on or after 1 December 2022.\n[HTML_TABLE]\nLevelRequirement | Undergraduate | Postgraduate coursework | Higher Degree by Research\nEnglish language tests | 13–14; Table 2 | 23–24; Table 6 | 33–34; Table 8\nPrior senior secondary education | 15–17; Tables 3, 4 | 25–26 | Not accepted\nPrior tertiary education at AQF Levels 5-10 | 18–20 | 27–29 | 35–36\nUniversity preparation studies:English language programs, Foundation programs, Other programs | 21; Table 5 | 30–31; Table 7 | 37; Table 9\n[HTML_TABLE]\nTest | Minimum scores\nIELTS Academic [including One Skill Retake]and IELTS UKVI Academic [including One Skill Retake]IELTS results must be completed at an IELTS testing centre; online test results are not accepted. | All of the following:     Overall score: 6.5     Reading: 6.0     Writing: 6.0     Listening: 6.0     Speaking: 6.0\nTOEFL iBT [excluding Home Edition] | All of the following:     Overall score: 80     Reading: 20     Writing: 20     Listening: 18     Speaking: 18The TOEFL institutional code for the ANU is 0506.

Admission to most ANU programs is on a competitive basis. Therefore, meeting all admission requirements does not automatically guarantee entry.\nApplicants must present a Bachelor degree or international equivalent in a cognate discipline with a minimum GPA of 5.0/7.0, with at least one course in the field of mathematics that must cover calculus and linear algebra.\nApplicants with an ANU Graduate Certificate (with four Statistics/Mathematics courses) with a GPA of 4.0/7.0, with at least one course in the field of mathematics from university studies that must cover calculus and linear algebra.\nIn line with the university's admissions policy and strategic plan, an assessment for admission may include competitively ranking applicants on the basis of specific academic achievement, English language proficiency and diversity factors. However, applicants will first be ranked on a GPA ('GPA1') that is calculated using all but the last semester (or equivalent) of the Bachelor degree used for admission purposes.\nIf required, ranking may further be confirmed on the basis of:\n• a GPA ('GPA2') calculated on the penultimate and antepenultimate semesters (or equivalent) of the Bachelor degree used for admission purposes; and/or\n• demonstrating higher-level English language proficiency.\nPrior to enrolment in this ANU program, all students who gain entry will have their Bachelor degree reassessed, to confirm minimum requirements were met.\nFurther information: English Language Requirements for Admission\nDiversity factors\nAs Australia’s national university, ANU is global representative of Australian research and education. ANU endeavours to recruit and maintain a diverse and deliberate student cohort representative not only of Australia, but the world. In order to achieve these outcomes, competitive ranking of applicants may be adjusted to ensure access to ANU is a reality for brilliant students from countries across the globe.\nAssessment of qualifications\nUnless otherwise indicated, ANU will accept all Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF) qualifications or international equivalents that meet or exceed the published admission requirements of our programs, provided all other admission requirements are also met.\nWhere an applicant has more than one completed tertiary qualification, ANU will base assessment on the qualification that best meets the admission requirements for the program. Find out more about the Australian Qualifications Framework: www.aqf.edu.au\nANU uses a 7-point Grade Point Average (GPA) scale. All qualifications submitted for admission at ANU will be converted to this common scale, which will determine if an applicant meets our published admission requirements. Find out more about how a 7-point GPA is calculated for Australian universities: www.uac.edu.au/future-applicants/admission-criteria/tertiary-qualifications\nUnless otherwise indicated, where an applicant has more than one completed tertiary qualification, ANU will calculate the GPA for each qualification separately. ANU will base assessment on the best GPA of all completed tertiary qualifications of the same level or higher.\nApplicants may be eligible for up to 24 units (one semester) of credit for courses completed towards an incomplete AQF Level 9 or above qualification.\nAccounting, Actuarial Studies, Business, Commerce, Data Science, Economics, Finance, Health Sciences, Information Technology, Management, Marketing, Mathematics, Medicine, Public Administration, Science, Statistics.\nDomestic Tuition Fees (DTF)\nFor more information see: http://www.anu.edu.au/students/program-administration/costs-fees\nFor further information on International Tuition Fees see: https://www.anu.edu.au/students/program-administration/fees-payments/international-tuition-fees\nAll students are required to pay the Services and amenities fee (SA Fee)\nThe annual indicative fee provides an estimate of the program tuition fees for international students and domestic students (where applicable). The annual indicative fee for a program is based on the standard full-time enrolment load of 48 units per year (unless the program duration is less than 48 units). Fees for courses vary by discipline meaning that the fees for a program can vary depending on the courses selected. Course fees are reviewed on an annual basis and typically will increase from year to year. The tuition fees payable are dependent on the year of commencement and the courses selected and are subject to increase during the period of study.\nFor further information on Fees and Payment please see: https://www.anu.edu.au/students/program-administration/fees-payments\nANU offers a wide range of scholarships to students to assist with the cost of their studies.\nEligibility to apply for ANU scholarships varies depending on the specifics of the scholarship and can be categorised by the type of student you are.  Specific scholarship application process information is included in the relevant scholarship listing.\nFor further information see the Scholarships website.\nIn disciplines as diverse as biology, economics, actuarial studies, psychology, physics, archaeology, medicine and information technology, there is always a need for qualified statisticians to make proper sense of the data. The Master of Statistical Data Analysis will provide you with a rigorous training in core statistical application and theory. This will set you up as a professional statistician whose services will be highly sought-after. With an ANU Master of Statistical Data Analysis you will excel in your career literally anywhere in the world.\nANU ranks among the world's very finest universities. Our nearly 100,000 alumni include political, business, government, and academic leaders around the world.\nWe have graduated remarkable people from every part of our continent, our region and all walks of life.\nFor Domestic Students applying through UAC: If you have completed an overseas qualification, please send a scanned copy of your original testamur (graduation certificate) and academic transcript through to info.cbe@anu.edu.au. The scanned documents should be in colour and unaltered in size.
