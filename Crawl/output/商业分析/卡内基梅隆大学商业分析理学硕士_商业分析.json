We ask you to provide a bit of personal, professional, and educational information to get to know you better.\nWe suggest that you create your essay and goals and then sit down to complete the online form.

These may be copies of transcripts that you already have in your possession. However, these cannot be web transcripts. A web transcript is anything obtained from an online student portal, downloaded from your student record, or retrieved online.\nTranscripts uploaded during the application process are considered “unofficial.” What makes a transcript \"unofficial\" is that you have it in your possession instead of us receiving it in a sealed, stamped envelope directly from your university.\nPro Tip: View a sample of a web transcript that you should avoid submitting.\nAll candidates are required to upload legible, scanned/digitized copies of their unofficial transcripts and degree certificates which include the following:\nPro Tip: If your uploaded transcript doesn’t include all the required information, we will need to contact you to send the missing items, and your application may be delayed.\nPro Tip: Official transcripts (those sent directly by the degree-granting institution) are not required during the application process. Should you be admitted, you will be required to submit official transcripts later.\nWe accept both in-person and online versions of the GMAT, GMAT Focus, GRE, TOEFL, and IELTS.\nOnce we receive the official score, we will update your application checklist accordingly.\nRequest that the official score is sent to us using the following instructions:\nFull-Time MSBA: 69H-XH-31Part-Time MSBA: 69H-XH-43\nGRE Program Code: Carnegie Mellon Tepper School of Business: 4883\nPro Tip: GMAT and GRE scores are valid for five years and must be valid at the time you submit your application.\nPro Tip: If you have taken the GMAT or GRE more than once, report the highest overall score from any one testing date when completing the online application.\nOur MSBA is focused on the success of our students in the classroom and in employment outcomes. The application process allows us to assess the readiness of candidates and provide guidance in improving future academic and career outcomes.\nWe believe standardized exams are one way that business programs gauge academic readiness; however while many Full-Time MSBA applicants will submit a GMAT/GRE/EA score, we also recognize there are multiple ways to demonstrate academic readiness. This is the reason we offer a test waiver option for Full-Time MSBA applicants. Here is some guidance on our test waiver option:\nUpon submission of your application, the waiver request will be reviewed, and you will receive a response to the waiver request via email within 10 business days of the application deadline. Please note, only complete applications will be reviewed for test waivers.\nCandidates are required to demonstrate a level of competence in English to meet the admissions requirements of the university. You are required to take a TOEFL, IELTS, or Duolingo exam unless:\nYou must request that the official score be sent from the testing agency to our program for us to verify the score entered into the application. Request that the official score be sent to us using the following codes:\nPro Tip: TOEFL and IELTS scores are valid for two years and must be valid at the time you submit your application.\nPro Tip: If you earned a degree from a non-U.S. institution, your academic documents should state that the sole language of instruction for the entire university was English in order to be eligible for a TOEFL/IELTS/Duolingo waiver. If your academic documents don’t include this, you should upload an official letter from the University Registrar indicating English as the mode of instruction for the entirety of the degree.\nThere is one required essay (maximum 500 words) for all Tepper MSBA applicants. You are now able to choose which essay question resonates most with you and how you can present your best application. Please choose 1 of the following 2 questions. We do not have a preference on which question you answer. Here are the 2 options:\nThere also is an optional essay for additional information about your candidacy that you may wish to share with the admissions committee. Use this essay to convey important information that you may not have otherwise been able to convey. This may include unexplained resume gaps, context for recommender selection, etc. However, do not feel obligated to complete the optional essay.\nNew for the Fall 2023 application cycle is a required video essay to discuss your post-MSBA goals.\nWe know this is an important component of your decision to attend business school. We take it seriously as well. Please describe your post-MSBA career goals.\nIt would be helpful to consider the following information in your response:\nWe require just one recommendation. Ideally, you would pick a supervisor (current or previous), however, anyone who can speak to your professional work experience in detail would be appropriate.\nWe use the GMAC Common Letter of Recommendation (LOR). The Common LOR is intended to save you and your recommender valuable time by providing a single set of recommendation questions for each participating school. This allows your recommender to use the same answers for multiple letter submissions, alleviating the workload of having to answer different questions for each school multiple times. You benefit because it makes the ask for several different letters to be written on your behalf much easier.\nA $125 application fee is required of all applicants. This fee can be paid online using a credit card at the time of submission.\nOnce you have completed your online application, if you have any supporting documents, they should be uploaded directly to your application via your application status page in the application portal.\nIf you have submitted all the application components, it isn’t necessary to send anything else to us at this point. Upon admission, you’ll need to send your official transcripts/academic documents. These details will be included in the admission letter, so no need to worry about it now.\nFollowing submission of your application, you may be invited to interview with a member of our MSBA Admissions team. Our evaluative interviews are by invitation only and are required.\nWe begin to invite applicants to interview within one week of the application deadline. However, you may receive an invitation any time prior to the decision notification date.\nAt the Tepper School, the Admissions team conducts behavioral interviews. The behavioral interview technique is used to review a candidate’s specific experiences and behaviors in an attempt to predict his or her potential for success at the Tepper School.\nWe are particularly interested in learning about candidates' skills and perspectives on teamwork, leadership, success, and failure. To prepare, we suggest that you:\nWe welcome applicants from around the globe and encourage non-U.S. citizens to apply to the Tepper School MSBA program.\nReview our information for international applicants to learn more about certification of financial resources and visa regulations.\nThe Part-Time MSBA program is entrance exam (GMAT/GMAT Focus/GRE TEST) OPTIONAL. Throughout your application, you can showcase your readiness in a way that best reflects your strengths.
