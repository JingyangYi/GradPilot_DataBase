With the opportunity to develop new skills across different subjects, your new technical capabilities will be informed by industry context as you develop the interpersonal skills that set you apart.\nThe 10-month sequence motivates your learning. In July, your program starts with a launch experience that prepares you for the curriculum. The rest of the experience is organized into five 6-week terms.\nDuring the first term, your class takes foundational courses before moving into focused tracks for the remainder of the program. Over the next four terms, you'll complete courses in your selected focus along with the opportunity to take curricular and co-curricular courses spanning the MQM: Business Analytics program. You'll be able to push your limits and broaden your industry exposure.\nAll Fuqua degree programs are taught by the same world-renowned faculty, scholars recognized for excellence in both teaching and research. The classes they teach are academically challenging and relevant to business today. In spite of their world-class credentials, your professors are highly accessible—with an open-door policy, they’re often happy to continue a classroom debate over coffee or lunch.\nWhat sets Fuqua apart is the way we structure our programs—as learning teams. You’ll collaborate on coursework and projects with a team of 4–6 students hand-picked to ensure you learn from people with different backgrounds. Replicating a corporate environment, you’ll learn as much from your team experience as you do from your courses—gaining an understanding of the ways drawing strength from others leads to stronger results.\nYou'll apply for a functional track in either Finance, Marketing, Information Risk Management, or Strategy as part of the admissions process.

You'll learn to ask good questions and explore data from multiple perspectives in order to enhance your critical thinking, as well as exploring how best to collaborate with others as you tackle today's problems in teams where members differ in expertise and specialization.\nKnowing how to analyze and improve performance in organizations and exert your influence for positive results at any level in your organization is important for long-term career success. This course has two goals—to provide a roadmap for understanding how organizations function and to provide basic concepts you can build on later in your career.\nLearn the basics of, and develop proficiency in programming in R and Python.\nExamine a framework for data-driven decision making under conditions of partial information and uncertainty. You’ll acquire probabilistic and statistical tools for understanding, analyzing, and interpreting data.\nEnsuring the validity and availability of data is critical to leveraging it within an organization. In this course, you’ll explore the fundamentals of data storage, cleansing, and retrieval, using SQL, in order to facilitate data usage in your organization, examining structured, relational database design, and data integrity issues.\nDeeply explore the interplay between data science and business decisions. You'll learn supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques such as classification, clustering, and text mining.\nUnderstand the foundations and applications of analytics methodologies currently being used in many industries. Building on the materials you developed in Data Science for Business, explore 1) more advanced tools such as deep learning and NLP, 2) modern use cases across industries, and 3) societal issues arising from deployment of modern analytics such as privacy, fairness, and responsible AI considerations.\nGain an overview of modeling frameworks and the art and science of modeling decisions. You’ll learn about decision trees for structuring decision problems under uncertainty, Monte Carlo simulation for simulating decision situations with many uncertainties, and optimization for finding the best possible solution in problems with many decision variables and constraints.\nLearn how great analysts explain the significance of any statistical model to any audience member.

Topics include advertising markets and integrated marketing communication, attribution, ad networks and media buying, campaign performance measurement, social media, search marketing, auctions, e-commerce, marketplaces, assortment and pricing, and multi-channel marketing.\nGathering, analyzing, and interpreting data about markets and customers is critical for the success of an organization. This skill is important for careers in marketing, consulting, and entrepreneurship. You’ll analyze data to understand customers and inform marketing decisions, evaluate the quality and usefulness of available data and analyses conducted by others, and communicate analysis-based conclusions to colleagues and managers.\nCovering a number of overlapping frameworks, you’ll explore the stages of the customer lifecycle and the revenue and profit stream that can be managed according to each stage of the cycle. You’ll learn about quantitative methods to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of customer relationship management (CRM) activities, and an array of CRM-specific models, tools, and frameworks and how to apply them to real-world problems.\nWhile most of a firm’s marketing activities create value for the customer, pricing is the only marketing activity that creates value for the firm. You will examine the quantitative tools used to formulate pricing strategy consistent with the firm’s marketing strategy, and how to formulate pricing tactics, estimate the value of a product or service, estimate own-price and cross-price elasticities, and determine when price promotions should occur.\nLearn the concepts of Enterprise Risk Management, the enterprise-wide process applied to identify and manage the risk of potential events that may affect the entity.

We encourage you to take part in our virtual campus visit program and the virtual Blue Devil Experience event for admitted students. Attending these events will introduce you to the Durham area and help guide your transition—or give you valuable insights if you’re still making your decision.\nShortly after you’re admitted, you’ll receive access to our incoming student website. This site includes a wealth of information about our community and expectations, helping to guide your decision.\nHere you’ll find all the information you’ll need to transition into your new academic life:\nIf applicable, visa application information will be included in your admission packet along with specific deadlines for submission. Visa processing can take up to several months to complete, so it is critical you apply no later than Round 2 to ensure that you’re able to join the program.\nIf you are currently in the U.S. on a student visa for another program, contact our admissions office prior to making plans to leave the country or transferring your visa to ensure that the proper steps are taken to secure your new visa for the MQM: Business Analytics program.\nVisa fast facts:\nLegible, scanned copies of all transcripts are required for each college or university you have attended where you:\nIf you took classes at a college or university while in high school, do not list the college or university as a separate school in your application.\nFor transfer credits: Follow the guidelines listed above, but please note that for any transferred credits that qualify to be reported, we need to see grades/marks.  If the grades/marks as well as the credits appear on your degree-conferring institution's transcript, then the additional transcript will not be required.\nFor student abroad credits: Please follow the same guidelines as for transfer credits.\nIf your transcripts do not state the degree and date conferred, upload a copy of your diploma in addition to the transcript. If your transcript is not in English, it must be translated, attested, and uploaded along with the originals. Those applying from outside the U.S. should see additional transcript guidelines for international students.\nTo be eligible to apply, an applicant must have earned, or be in the process of completing, a bachelor’s degree from an accredited college or university. No specific undergraduate major is considered preferable to any other. The bachelor's degree must be completed prior to the start of the Fuqua program to which you are applying.\nIf you do not submit your official transcripts on time, or if you misrepresent, falsify, or omit information, we may rescind any offer of admission or financial assistance.\nWhen to submit copies of official transcripts\nOnly if you are admitted to the program, will you be required to submit official transcripts from each college or university you have attended for verification. The due date for official transcripts will be noted in your admitted student portal. If you have not yet completed your studies by this date, your official transcripts should reach The Fuqua School of Business no later than one week before your program begins.\nThe admissions committee wants to learn more about your personal and professional motivations. To help us get to know you better, you’ll need to provide your thoughts on one short-answer question and two essays as part of your application.\nAll essays are scanned using plagiarism detection software. Expressing your ideas by using verbiage from existing sources, including websites and other applicants' essays or materials, or having someone else compose your essays, without properly crediting those sources constitutes an act of plagiarism. Plagiarism, an act of theft and fraud, is considered a cheating violation within the Honor Code and will result in an application denial. Note: if you have worked with a consultant to complete your application materials, please ensure that the Honor Code policy is discussed and yours essays will not be shared with other potential applicants.\nAnswer both short-answer essays. Respond in 750 characters at most per question.\nQuestion 1: Why did you select your preferred track(s) (Finance, Marketing, Risk, or Strategy)?\nQuestion 2: What are your immediate career goals after completing the MQM: Business Analytics program?\nPresent your response to question 1 in list form, numbered 1-25. Some points may be only a few words, while others may be longer. Your complete list should not exceed two pages.\nQuestion 1:\n“25 Random Things About Yourself” Our spirit of community is what sets the Fuqua experience apart. The concepts extend beyond the student body to include faculty, staff, and administration. When a new person joins the admissions team, we ask that person to share with everyone in the office a list of \"25 Random Things About Yourself.\" As an admissions team, we already know the new hire's professional and academic background, so learning these \"25 Random Things\" helps us to get to know someone's personality, background, special talents, and more.\nIn this spirit, the admissions committee also wants to get to know you beyond the professional and academic achievements listed in your resume and transcript. You can share with us important life experiences, your likes and dislikes, hobbies, achievements, fun facts, or anything that helps us understand what makes you who you are.\nYour response to essay question 2 should be no more than 350 words.\nQuestion 2:\nFor our MQM: Business Analytics class, the Admissions team is looking for students who are eager to engage with, and learn from, their classmates. This learning takes place both inside and outside the classroom, as extracurricular engagement is an important part of the MQM experience. Describe how you would plan to be engaged outside of the classroom, and how your unique perspective, experiences, and passions will add to the MQM community.\nIf you feel there are circumstances of which the admissions committee should be aware (e.g., unexplained gaps in work, choice of recommenders or lack of a professional recommendation, inconsistent or questionable academic performance), please explain them. Do NOT upload additional essays nor additional recommendations in this area. The optional essay is intended to provide the admissions committee with insight into your circumstances only.\nAn additional essay is required for re-applicants. Respond to the following in no more than two pages:\nQuestion: It is not uncommon for it to take more than one try to achieve a goal.

If test scores are expired, please contact the Office of Admissions to discuss your situation.\nWe do require one of these test scores in order for an application to be considered complete and receive an admissions decision.\nWe do not accept TOEFL or IELTS test scores.

Complete all application components.\n2. Make sure your references have been notified.\n3. Polish your essays.\n4. Submit your best test scores.\nCampus VisitsOpen HousesDiversity WeekendsClass Observations\nDecide if we're a good fit\nContact recommenders, prep for GMAT/GRE\nCreate resume, draft essays\nShare your story and goals\nBy invitation on campus or via video-conference\nA good match is important from both sides—yours and ours—so we take a holistic approach to considering each candidate. All the components of your application give you the chance to demonstrate your strengths and your fit with Fuqua. You’ll be considered a strong applicant if:\nAlthough not required for admission, your prior work experience helps us understand how you’ve developed, on both a professional and personal level.\nFuqua admits candidates to the MQM: Business Analytics program who have strong quantitative and analytical skills and who will excel in a demanding, fast-paced environment. We admit applicants with:\nEnglish Language Proficiency: English as a Second Language test scores are no longer accepted. Fuqua does not require scores for English tests. We will no longer be accepting ESL test scores, even as an optional material submission. We will continue to utilize all other aspects of the application – other standardized tests, essays, undergraduate record, recommendation, and the interview – to evaluate English language skills.\nYour resume, application essays, recommendation, and interview are what weave fit, passion, and impact together into your \"story.\" No one part is more important than the other, so give each one your best. And most importantly, just be you.\nYou must include a current 1-page professional resume. Please start with your current position and include employment information (full and part-time) and relevant volunteer work, internships, or student club or organization positions. Your education section should show dates of attendance and degrees received.\nYour essays allow us to get to know you as a person—what drives you and inspires you. You have the chance here to fill in any gaps or provide extra details on key areas of your application.\nRecommendation:\nRecommendations provide a third-party perspective on your ability to succeed at Fuqua. One letter of recommendation is required and should come from someone who knows you in a professional context, such as a supervisor at an internship or place of employment. If you are unable to provide a professional recommendation, you may submit a recommendation from someone who knows you through school and can speak to your performance in an academic setting. Please clarify if you select this option in the Optional Essay. You may not submit more than one recommendation. Prepare your recommender so they represent you well and showcase aspects of you that are not reflected in other areas of the application.\nWe do not offer open interviews for MQM: Business Analytics candidates. Interviews will be extended by invitation after careful review of your application materials. Most interviews will occur via video-conference; North Carolina residents may have the opportunity to interview on campus by invitation. Both formats carry equal weight in the admissions process. Interviews are conducted with individual applicants by staff, alumni, or select second-year MBA students.\nDuring your interview, you’ll have the opportunity to:\nVisit our FAQ page for answers to our most frequently asked questions for the MQM: Business Analytics program.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nTeam up over 10 months.\nGain skills in finance, marketing, risk, and strategy.\nExplore how it’s done in the real world.\nLaunch your career with us by your side.\nDiscover Durham’s big-city options and small-town vibe.\nHere's what you need to get started.\nWe want to hear your story.\nLearn about Fuqua in person or online.\nSee a snapshot of our current class.\nDetermine your investment.\nLearn how to fund the program.\n• Research Us\nDecide if we're a good fit\n• Plan Ahead\nContact recommenders, prep for GMAT/GRE\n• Work on Application\nCreate resume, draft essays\n• Submit Best Application\nShare your story and goals\n• Interview\nBy invitation on campus or via video-conference\n• Receive a Decision\n• We’re confident you will be successful in our program.\n• You’ll add value to your peers and to Fuqua throughout your academic, personal, and professional experiences.\n• You believe diversity in thought and background are important within your community.\n• You demonstrate competence, character, and purpose and have the strongest potential to be a leader who is a positive force for change.\n• There is no minimum work experience required for this program.\n• Any paid or unpaid work experience will be considered, including volunteer, part-time work, internships, and student clubs and activities.\n• You should have no more than 3 years of full-time, post-graduate work experience.

Within minutes, you can explore downtown’s nightlife and foodie reputation. Need some space? Check out our hiking trails, golf courses, gardens, and lakes. You’ll enjoy discovering an area that’s been ranked one of the nation's most livable—and exciting—places for business by Money, Fortune, Forbes, Entrepreneur, and more. Despite its small-town feel, Raleigh-Durham is home to more than 1.3 million people.\nDuring your program, you’ll live in Durham, learn at Fuqua, and discover what the greater Duke community has to offer.\nDurham is a global economic player driven by knowledge-based enterprises—including everything from software and information technology to film and TV production. It is also home to Research Triangle Park (RTP), one of the oldest and largest science parks in the U.S., where companies are turning data into powerful decision tools. The 150+ companies based there range from Fortune 100 multinationals to start-ups. SAS® software was born here and has grown into the largest independent business intelligence vendor in the world. The innovation ecosystem that fostered SAS has drawn nearly every company in the informatics business, from IBM, NetApp, and Cisco to Ipreo Holdings and Evaluserve.\nHaving RTP so close to Fuqua means we’re able invite influential local speakers, connect businesses with student clubs, and tap our more than 3,000 local Fuqua alumni as mentors for students.\nVogue recently named Durham the “hippest” city in North Carolina, with a creative culinary scene as well as noteworthy arts and entertainment venues.
