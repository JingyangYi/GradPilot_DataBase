Our faculty members bring a diverse expertise spanning business, academia, and technology as well as share cutting-edge developments in AI and machine learning beyond textbook theories. Students transitioning from traditional industries can join this programme as it serves as both a gateway to analytical techniques and a window into future tech evolution.\nAnother valuable aspect is the connections you’ll forge with your peers.

These interactions will mold you into a business analyst who synergizes field expertise with technological fluency to deliver transformative value.\nLearning remains a lifelong journey of discovery. I extend my heartfelt gratitude to PolyU for this pivotal chapter that has systematically organized my professional experiences while equipping me with new competencies, broader perspectives, and renewed confidence to navigate tomorrow’s challenges.\nThe MSc in Business Analytics programme has shaped my analytical thinking and built my professional confidence. The curriculum balances theoretical frameworks with practical applications, equipping students with the skills needed to excel in data-driven roles.\nTraining in industry-standard tools such as Python, SQL, SPSS, SmartPLS, and everyday tools like Excel has strengthened my technical capabilities, preparing me for job market demands. Unlike many similar programmes, this one emphasizes cultivating essential business analytics and problem-solving skills—critical for turning data into strategic recommendations and standing out in a competitive field.\nWhat I found most valuable was the focus on experiential learning. Through case studies, group projects, and hands-on assignments, I was able to apply analytical techniques to complex business challenges. These experiences deepened my understanding of data analytics and enhanced my ability to deliver actionable insights in a business context.\nI am grateful for the enriching academic environment and dedicated faculty support, especially through networking events that connected me with industry leaders and alumni, enriching my professional development. This programme has laid a strong foundation for my career and given me the confidence to pursue opportunities in the fast-evolving field of business analytics.\nBoth copies of transcripts and certificates are required.\n• Taught Postgraduate\n• The programme has been selected by the University Grants Committee (UGC) for the Hong Kong Future Talents Scholarship Scheme for Advanced Studies.

In case of any dispute/disagreement, PolyU’s decision is final.\nAs a hands-on marketer in the hospitality and tourism sector, staying abreast of the latest trends is imperative. The MSc in Marketing Management programme at PolyU has equipped me with the skills needed to thrive in this dynamic landscape. The synergy of theoretical insights and practical applications from professors, together with class discussions, case studies and sharing from industry gurus, has given me a comprehensive understanding of marketing and management.\nThis programme has also provided exposure to diverse cultures and enabled me to collaborate with classmates from various industries and backgrounds. This has enriched my perspective and comprehension of marketing in a broader context. Furthermore, out-of-curriculum sessions on business etiquette, networking and corporate visits enabled me to cultivate connections both within and beyond the marketing realm.\nI extend my heartfelt appreciation to PolyU for this transformative and unforgettable experience. This programme represents an exceptional opportunity for both recent graduates embarking on the evolving marketing landscape and seasoned professionals endeavouring to augment their knowledge and fortify their decision-making capabilities with a robust foundation in business theories.\nMarketing is a dynamic field that combines theory with rapid changes driven by content, media, and data. I chose the MSc in Marketing Management programme to gain structured and immersive learning, enhancing my knowledge following several years of experience in this industry.\nOne of the programme's key benefits is access to tremendous resources. These include the preparation and expertise of the professors from the marketing industry, the opportunity to exchange ideas with fellow students from diverse cultural and career backgrounds, and the activities and career workshops offered by the MM department, all designed to enrich our studies. These resources help emphasise real-world application and career development.\nAdditionally, the programme's innovation is evident in its elective subjects, which are continually updated to meet current industry needs and align with students' interests.\nI appreciated the holistic perspective provided by the PolyU MSc in Marketing Management programme.

In case of any dispute/disagreement, PolyU’s decision is final.\nChoosing to pursue the MSc in Human Resource Management at PolyU allowed me to re-examine my past work experience and reshape the direction of my future development.\nAfter working for several years, it was the ideal time for me to join this programme. It provided a valuable bridge between theory and practice, which enriched my understanding of HR. Many of the questions I had encountered in my previous work found clear theoretical explanations through lectures and personal reflection. At the same time, group projects gave me the chance to discuss real-world HR challenges with classmates from diverse professional backgrounds. These discussions were supported by professors who provided both academic expertise and practical guidance, helping us approach the issues with deeper understanding and clarity.\nBeyond gaining HR knowledge, the programme helped me develop a more proactive mindset in practice. My year at PolyU was transformative, upgrading my mental models, broadening my perspectives, and deepening my self-awareness.\nDuring my time in the MSc in Human Resource Management programme at PolyU, I've learned the skills of leadership and management, which have prepared me well for my future career. The courses covered theoretical knowledge,  practical applications, projects and case studies. The highlight of this programme was the HRM Seminars where industry experts, professionals and HR practitioners were invited to share their insights and experiences. Through the interaction and communications with them, I was inspired and became more confident to develop my career in the HR industry.\nThe skills I learned in this programme, like strategic HR planning and talent management, are directly applicable to my career and highly related to my experience. This programme has been updated to today's workplaces and its challenges, such as high turnover rates, burnout, work-life balance and mental health issues; the technology content in this programme is also reflected in the HR area.\nFor leaders who require taking part in people management, I strongly recommend this programme, and I think I've become a better leader after taking this programme.\nBoth copies of transcripts and certificates are required.\n• Taught Postgraduate\n• MPhil\n• PhD\n• Taught Postgraduate\n• Undergraduate\n• Undergraduate\n• A conversion programme for general and HR professionals and managers\n• A wide range of people management courses\n• Emphasis on both theory and practice\n• Local and global perspectives in the private and public sectors\n• Students are empowered to reach their career potential via professional coaching and career services\n• 4 Compulsory Subjects (3 credits each)\n• 6 Elective Subjects (3 credits each)\n• 1 AIE Subject (1 credit)\n• 4 Compulsory Subjects (3 credits each)\n• 2 Elective Subjects (3 credits each)\n• 1 AIE Subject (1 credit)\n• the subject Research Methods (3 credits) and a Dissertation (9 credits)\n• Human Resource Management*\n• Human Resource Development\n• Organization and Management*\n• Organizational Behaviour*\n• Academic Integrity and Ethics in Business (non-chargeable)\n• Business Analytics\n• Decision Analytics by Machine Learning\n• Decision Making for Leadership\n• Entrepreneurship\n• Field Study for Business Management\n• Human Resource Management in China\n• HRM Seminars\n• International Management\n• Leading Global Sustainability\n• Management of Pay and Benefits\n• Marketing Management\n• Mediation at Workplace\n• Negotiation and Conflict Management\n• Practice of Human Resource Management\n• Research Methods\n• Strategic Human Resource Management\n• Strategic Management*\n• Wellbeing at Work\n• MM MSc Career Workshop (0 credit)\n• A Bachelor's degree or equivalent professional qualification, preferably with at least 1 year of relevant work experience.\n• Applicants, normally aged 27 or above, with other post-secondary qualifications and at least 6 years of work experience in industry, commerce or public administration, including 3 years in a managerial capacity, will also be considered.\n• PolyU Main Site\n• Academic Registry (AR)\n• Global Engagement Office (GEO)\n• Graduate School (GS)\n• Office of Undergraduate Studies (OUS)\n• Student Affairs Office (SAO)\n• Hong Kong Community College (HKCC)\n• School of Professional Education and Executive Development (SPEED)\n• JUPAS\n• School Nominations Direct Admission Scheme (SNDAS)",

In case of any dispute/disagreement, PolyU’s decision is final.\nPursuing a career in a multinational corporation has always been my goal, and the MSc in Global Business and Decision Analysis (GBDA) at PolyU has made this possible. With a background in supply chain management, the programme equipped me with the tools to tackle significant challenges. Courses such as Global Business and Business Analytics developed my ability to analyse complex data, optimise operations, and make strategic decisions; skills I now apply daily. Additionally, the programme provided me with cross-cultural negotiation techniques, teaching me to bridge cultural gaps and align stakeholders across regions.\nA defining moment occurred during my interview for a multinational firm’s Management Trainee programme. When faced with a case study, I applied the frameworks learned through the GBDA’s curriculum. My solutions mirrored real-world scenarios practised in class, impressing the interviewers with their practicality and depth. This demonstrated how the programme’s blend of theory and hands-on learning prepares students to excel in high-stakes environments.\nBeyond technical skills, the GBDA emphasised cross-cultural collaboration and adaptability. Leading multicultural teams in group projects honed my ability to resolve conflicts, build consensus, and drive results in dynamic settings, skills critical for thriving in multinational workplaces.\nFor anyone aspiring to succeed in international business, this programme is an invaluable launchpad.\nA distinctive strength of this programme lies in its balanced curriculum. While providing the freedom to choose courses from different business departments, the programme ensures we build expertise in key areas such as global supply chains, accounting and finance, and data analytics. For instance, through courses such as Models for Decision Making, I learned to apply predictive models to real scenarios like optimising shipping routes and managing financial risks.Further, the programme’s emphasis on practical learning ensures theoretical concepts translate into actionable skills. Through real-world case studies embedded in the curriculum, we analyse authentic business scenarios ranging from multinational expansions to operational optimisations.Additionally, the programme empowers professionals across industries to develop their original expertise. With four years of working experience, I arrived with domain-specific knowledge but limited strategic decision-making frameworks. Through collaborative learning with peers from tech, consulting, and entrepreneurship backgrounds, I’ve developed adaptable methodologies applicable to career growth, business innovation, and even complex personal decisions.\n• Taught Postgraduate\n• MPhil\n• PhD\n• Taught Postgraduate\n• Undergraduate\n• Undergraduate\n• Provide students with solid training in strategic thinking and scientific decision-making\n• Provide students with a comprehensive understanding of how operating across borders will impact various business functional areas (including supply chain/operations, logistics, accounting, finance, and other related management areas)\n• Registered Lean Six Sigma Green Belt (RLSSGB)\n• Registered Six Sigma Green Belt (RSSGB) and Registered Lean Leader (RLL)\n• Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Certificate\n• Academic Integrity and Ethics in Business (1 credit)\n• Global Business\n• International Trade and Logistics Management\n• Models for Decision Making*\n• Business Analytics*\n• At least one of these methodology-focused subjects:\nProject Management*\nStatistics for Management*\nApplications of Decision-Making Models*\nGlobal Risk and Decision Analysis\nCoding for Management with Python\n• Project Management*\n• Statistics for Management*\n• Applications of Decision-Making Models*\n• Global Risk and Decision Analysis\n• Coding for Management with Python\n• At least one of these supply chain, logistics, and operations-focused subjects:\nGlobal Sourcing and Supply*\nInternational Operations Management*\nContemporary Issues in Operations Management*\nInternational Logistics Systems, Operations and Management\n• Global Sourcing and Supply*\n• International Operations Management*\n• Contemporary Issues in Operations Management*\n• International Logistics Systems, Operations and Management\n• At least one of these accounting, finance, management and marketing-focused subjects:\nInternational Accounting*\nAccounting for Managers\nManagerial Finance*\nInternational Management*\nMarketing Management*\nGlobal Marketing in Cross-Cultural Perspectives\nManaging Innovation\n• International Accounting*\n• Accounting for Managers\n• Managerial Finance*\n• International Management*\n• Marketing Management*\n• Global Marketing in Cross-Cultural Perspectives\n• Managing Innovation\n• Project Management*\n• Statistics for Management*\n• Applications of Decision-Making Models*\n• Global Risk and Decision Analysis\n• Coding for Management with Python\n• Global Sourcing and Supply*\n• International Operations Management*\n• Contemporary Issues in Operations Management*\n• International Logistics Systems, Operations and Management\n• International Accounting*\n• Accounting for Managers\n• Managerial Finance*\n• International Management*\n• Marketing Management*\n• Global Marketing in Cross-Cultural Perspectives\n• Managing Innovation\n• International Financial Management\n• Global Economic Environment for Management\n• Managerial Economics with an Application to China Business\n• Organisational Management in Shipping and Logistics\n• Shipping Economics and Markets\n• Air Transport Logistics and Management\n• Supply Chain Management\n• Intermodal Transport Management\n• Risk Management in Operations\n• Digital Procurement Management and Analytics\n• Contract Management\n• Managing Operations Systems\n• Managerial Thinking and Skills Workshop\n• Lean Six Sigma and Quality Management Techniques\n• Marketing Management in China\n• Research Project in Global Business and Decision Analysis (3-credit project)\n• Project (6 credits)\n• A Bachelor's degree or equivalent in any discipline.\n• Departments will consider applications on a rolling basis.

In case of any dispute/disagreement, PolyU’s decision is final.\nThis course has a unique blend of breadth and depth throughout its curriculum: there are compulsory courses which build a solid foundation; this enhanced our holistic understanding of operational frameworks by merging theory with real-world applications. The three specialized streams—Operations Analytics, Quality Management, and Operations Strategy allowed tailoring learning to research interests or career goals. I chose the Operations Analytics Stream, focusing on data-driven decision-making via courses to cultivate skills in extracting insights for efficiency improvement.\nAdditionally, the professors’ guidance was pivotal: their feedback and industry insights bridged classroom knowledge to practical scenarios, fostering analytical rigour and problem-solving abilities.\nMoreover, diverse electives not only broadened our knowledge but also enabled collaboration with students from varied disciplines. Through group projects and in-class discussions, we engaged in cross-disciplinary exchanges, sharing perspectives beyond operational limits while expanding professional networks. This integration of structured curricula, academic mentorship, and interdisciplinary collaboration has prepared me to confidently handle complex challenges in any operational issue.\nI was an economics graduate seeking new career horizons, the MScOM programme has been instrumental in enhancing my professional skills. It strengthened my core competencies in accounting and statistical analysis and equipped me with practical skills and tools through ERP systems, operational management systems and business analytics. Courses such as Supply Chain Management, Innovation Management, and Marketing broadened my perspective and fostered my problem-solving skills.\nWhat I valued most was the programme’s focus on real-world applications. The professors encouraged hands-on learning. In the class, we learned a lot of real-life business cases, so that we can think and get inspired in the cases. After each module, we worked in teams on projects to translate theories into actionable insights through case studies that simulated actual business challenges such as, optimizing systems, setting up an ERP system for the company, or evaluating market entry strategies. The constructive feedback from the professors during these exercises helped me refine both my technical approaches and my teamwork skills.\nThe MScOM bridges a rigorous academic framework with practical implementation.

In case of any dispute/disagreement, PolyU’s decision is final.\nDuring lectures, professors always remind us, \"You're Master's students now.\"\nWhat kind of state suits a Master's student? I think it should be one of having the enthusiasm for independent exploration, the ability for in-depth research, and the awareness of teamwork. And this is exactly what the GSCM programme has brought me.\nThe cultivation model of GSCM is rich. In lectures, the instruction consolidates our foundation. Outside class, professors organize field trips and company visits to help us see theories put into practice. The diverse assessment methods also train our practical exploration and ability to work in teams. Further, our professors' open-minded and attitude along with their targeted guidance, as well as the school's rich database resources, provide valuable help for us to complete reports and master knowledge.\nThrough one year of study in the GSCM programme, I have not only mastered knowledge related to the supply chain, but more importantly, I have developed the ability to identify and solve problems, as well as the courage to express myself with confidence. All these have provided strong support for my future career development.\nAfter over a decade working in the healthcare logistics industry, I chose to pursue the MSc in Global Supply Chain Management at PolyU to enhance my skills and stay ahead in an evolving field. The programme offered a well-balanced mix of academic theory and real-world application, which was directly relevant to my career goals.\nThroughout the programme, I gained valuable insights into the latest technological advancements shaping the logistics industry, as well as practical knowledge in managing logistics businesses more effectively. The programme also strengthened my expertise in procurement and supply chain management and fulfilled the requirements for MCIPS certification, further enhancing my professional qualifications. Additionally, the inclusion of Lean Six Sigma Black Belt training in quality management proved to be most impactful, equipping me with the tools to implement lean practices, identify causes of inefficiencies, and drive operational excellence.\nOverall, the programme has been instrumental in preparing me for senior leadership roles. It expanded my strategic thinking, deepened my industry knowledge, and empowered me to lead effectively. I’m proud to be a graduate of this programme and highly recommend it to professionals seeking advancement in the logistics and supply chain industry.\nThe personal statement should provide a self-introduction and detail the candidate's 5-year career aspiration.

At the outset, I knew textbooks alone wouldn’t be enough and this is where PolyU’s MSc ISTL programme is a game-changer. It didn’t just teach me the ropes—it threw me straight into the realistic operations world. From on-site port operations visits, to dissecting live case studies on global supply chain disruptions, the programme was hands-on, intense, and practical.\nNow, as I navigate my career at a leading global shipping company, those lessons have become my compass, I lean on the operational frameworks and leadership mindset the programme instilled in me.\nTo anyone considering a career in shipping or logistics: There is no alternative to a programme that balances theory with relentless, real-world shipping application in Hong Kong. In an industry that doesn’t wait, you need to hit the ground running, and PolyU’s MSc ISTL programme equips you to do exactly that!\nAfter working as a maritime consultant for a year with a background in biology, I decided to join the ISTL programme as a way to expand my domain knowledge and support my career development.\nI am grateful to have had the opportunity to engage in my studies and pursue my career development with the support of the Hong Kong Maritime and Logistics Scholarship Scheme. The additional subject and internship requirements of the full-time stream allowed me to further build and broaden my knowledge of the industry, beyond that of the mixed-mode stream.\nThe ISTL programme helps those who are currently in logistics as well as those looking to join the shipping, transportation and logistics sector. I enjoyed being taught by a combination of academic professors and professors of practice, who could provide us with knowledge and expertise underpinned by theory to make what we were learning about more applicable to our working lives. Further, it was great to have so much flexibility in determining my electives to tailor my study experience towards my specific interests.\nNow, having just wrapped up my studies, I would greatly encourage others to take this opportunity. Broaden your horizons, build lifelong connections, and most importantly, never stop learning!\n• Taught Postgraduate\n• Candidates are required to submit an admission application (44087-ISS) online together with the Scholarship form.\n• For details on applying to the MSc programme in International Shipping and Transport Logistics (Mixed-mode) (44087-IFM/IPM) (34 credits), please click here.\n• Please submit applications for 44087-IFM/IPM and 44087-ISS individually, as applications for these two programmes are processed separately. The application fee is non-transferable.\n• Please complete all of the relevant fields and enclose all necessary documents.

Please click here for details.\nPolyU reserves the right to change or withdraw the scholarship at any time. In case of any dispute/disagreement, PolyU’s decision is final.\nI spent five years developing intelligent ship systems, as a marine technology engineer,  after university. My work highlighted the importance of user-centric design, considering crew and shipowners, to align with industry needs. I also learned the value of adhering to maritime regulations, ensuring reliable systems, and understanding market trends to seize opportunities. These insights led me to the ISTL program, where I addressed real-world challenges through focused learning and growth.\nThe ISTL programme is comprehensive and has an in-depth curriculum. I built an understanding of the field by taking courses in shipping management and operations, shipping economics and markets, maritime law and insurance. The professors' emphasis on the importance of independent thinking made us realize that workplace challenges rarely have standard answers but require professional knowledge to dissect complex problems. This practical approach has been immensely beneficial to me. The teaching team not only possesses academic expertise but also hands-on industry experience: some are navigation experts who have served as ocean-going captains, others are maritime investigators who have participated in major marine accident inquiries, and others practising lawyers who have handled numerous maritime cases. These teachers bring not just theoretical frameworks but also industry insights after decades of professional experience. This integration of theory and practice allows us to master professional knowledge as well as feel the pulse of the industry.\nI am grateful for the opportunity to grow through the ISTL programme. As the university’s motto states: ‘To learn and to apply, for the benefit of mankind.’ ISTL empowers us to bridge cutting-edge expertise with real-world industry challenges, equipping us to navigate the seas of our ambitions.\nBefore joining the MScISTL programme, my knowledge of the maritime industry was mostly in bulk shipping. This programme broadened my understanding of the shipping and logistics field. It expanded my professional vision and connected me with classmates from diverse maritime backgrounds. Through our discussions and exchanges, I gained new perspectives of the industry, which made my future career path clearer and deepened my passion for shipping. The professors were highly knowledgeable and supportive, creating an inspiring learning environment.\nThanks to the solid foundation and insights I gained from the programme, I am now working as a new-build shipbroker. My role involves projects across container vessels, bulk carriers, tankers, Ro-Ro ships, and cruise ships. I've even had the opportunity to participate in sea trials and witness the delivery of brand-new vessels. These experiences would not have been possible without the training, guidance, and industry exposure provided by the MScISTL programme. It has played a crucial role in shaping my career path and opening doors in the global maritime industry.\n• Taught Postgraduate\n• Students admitted to the MSc programme may apply for early exit with a Postgraduate Diploma if they have met the specified credit requirements.\n• MPhil\n• PhD\n• Taught Postgraduate\n• Undergraduate\n• Undergraduate\n• Curriculum designed in consultation with industry leaders and prospective employers.\n• Academic theory balanced with professional practice.\n• Multidisciplinary knowledge integrated with specialist expertise.\n• Graduates pursue diverse career paths.\n• Graduates are granted exemptions from professional examinations.\n• Postgraduate Diploma offered as an intermediate exit.\n• Introduction to Shipping\n• Registered Lean Six Sigma Green Belt (RLSSGB)\n• Registered Six Sigma Green Belt (RSSGB) and Registered Lean Leader (RLL)\n• Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Certificate\n• Students complete 34 credits (2 Compulsory Subjects, 5 Restricted Elective Subjects and 5 Free Elective Subjects).

All of these skills are applicable to my job. It also broadened my horizons and enabled me to meet people from different business backgrounds.\nStudying real-life cases with classmates from different backgrounds was a good way of provoking thought and generating ideas. The programme was intensive but the learning experience was very satisfying and rewarding.\nThe programme increased my knowledge of and exposure to accounting practices. It trained me to apply my knowledge in a corporate setting and helped me to build a solid foundation for exercising my professional judgement.\nThe faculty and staff strive to bring insights to the class and to provide inspiration from their own stories or the stories of others. I may forget one or two formulae from time to time, but the underlying principles will probably stick with me for the rest of my life.\nI had a rewarding experience, which not only increased my knowledge of theoretical accounting principles but also gave me the opportunity to learn from the lecturers’ practical experience.\nThis programme bridges the gap between theoretical concepts and industry practice. Accreditation by HKICPA, ACCA and CPA Australia has facilitated my pursuit of a professional career.\nMany of the lecturers are experienced practitioners or reputable scholars in the fields of accounting, finance and taxation. They have provided me with extensive knowledge and specialist skills.\nThe programme further enhanced and updated my technical knowledge as well as gave me practical skills that have been critical to my career success. It also kept me abreast of the latest developments in the accounting profession.\nGraduating from the MPA programme has been a transformative journey for me. As a student who came non-accounting background, my accounting knowledge, technical skills and confidence in pursuing my dreams were greatly increased by my studies in the MPA programme. The exceptional faculty, diverse student community and experienced lecturers provided an environment that fostered my academic and personal growth.\nThe strong emphasis on practical learning and industry collaboration at PolyU ensured that I was well prepared for the professional world. Today, as I embark on my career, I owe much of my success to the invaluable education and support I received from the programme and PolyU.\nI am immensely proud to be a graduate of PolyU and would highly recommend the MPA programme to aspiring students who seek excellence in education. I encourage you all to embrace the remarkable opportunities that await you at this fine institution.\nThe MPA programme was an excellent choice for me. Some lecturers were experienced former practitioners from the business sector. Their practical skills and guidance helped me to gain in-depth and practical knowledge in the fields of accounting and finance, which was invaluable and prepared me well for my professional life as an accountant.\nThe programme not only sharpened my technical accounting skills but also enhanced my leadership and communication skills through a variety of coursework and class interactions.\nPolyU provided strong career support, and I am grateful to have been selected as one of the mentees in the INSPIRE Mentorship Programme. Connecting with a successful career mentor, who was a partner at a Big Four firm, allowed me to network with practitioners and gain insights and advice about the accounting industry. Furthermore, regular career workshops and one-to-one consultation were available to students in need.\nThe programme was an important stepping stone in obtaining my first job in the field of taxation after graduation. I highly recommend the MPA programme to anyone who would like to stay abreast of the latest developments in the accounting profession and to bolster their finance knowledge and accounting skills.\nCopies of graduation certificate and official academic transcript of studies are required.\nIf you wish to be exempted, either in full or in part, from the summer fundamental business course(s), please indicate equivalent subjects that you have taken in your prior studies.

It was very practical and relevant to my day-to-day work.\nAs a PolyU graduate, I know that the university focuses on practicality and helps students to build networks. The guest lectures were good opportunities for interacting with people such as Hong Kong, US and mainland Chinese regulators. I learned how to conduct AGMs and board meetings and gained extensive practical experience.\nLearning is much more than simply acquiring knowledge and professional qualifications. It is through learning that one is able to distinguish right from wrong, and to enhance critical thinking.\nThe programme helped me gain a professional qualification and develop analytical and critical thinking skills. It was the best platform for sharing knowledge and updates on work situations between professors, professionals and students.\nThis programme equipped me with skills and knowledge applicable to solving problems in accounting, governance and legal functions. It also enabled me to obtain the professional qualification of Chartered Secretary.\nIn addition to acquiring knowledge, group projects enabled me to hone my interpersonal and presentation skills and to develop friendships with my fantastic teammates.\nI learnt more than just theories, rules and regulations. Analytical skills are crucial for facilitating governance in the corporate environment in my profession.\nMCG at PolyU puts theory into practice. Lectures were essential for laying the foundation of my professional expertise and knowledge, enabling me to accumulate invaluable market-based assets and advance my development in corporate finance and in deal structuring.\nGood corporate governance is now a top priority for many boards, due to the enhanced risk management regulatory requirements of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and other regulators. This MCG programme provides me with intelligent insights from faculty members and fellow classmates. It also enables me to consolidate what I have learned into practical contributions to my industry’s regulatory development. This is indeed a unique and rewarding journey that I would recommend to anyone who desires to attain a management position.\nCopies of graduation certificate, official academic transcripts of studies and supporting document for the current/most recent employment are required.\nCopies of certificates of your membership(s) with professional bodies, if any.\nApplicants with any non-English certificates should also submit a set of corresponding official English-translated copies for reference.\n• Taught Postgraduate\n• MPhil\n• PhD\n• Taught Postgraduate\n• Undergraduate\n• Undergraduate\n• Appreciate the importance of business ethics pertaining to various corporate governance issues;\n• Comprehend best practices in respect of corporate governance, as required to achieve higher standards of corporate behaviour;\n• Develop a critical law and regulation insight and appreciate the role of law and regulation in corporate governance;\n• Apply the corporate accounting and finance concepts and financial reporting practices in accounting and financial planning, control and decision making;\n• Explain and apply current Hong Kong taxation law and practices to advise on tax implications in corporate management and decision making;\n• Comprehend and appreciate the legal aspects involved in company matters, the corporate governance system and boardroom dynamics of both Hong Kong and PRC companies;\n• Explain and apply different approaches to advise stakeholders on the use of risk frameworks to appraise, evaluate and support risk management at the board, company and group levels; and\n• Demonstrate an understanding of the applications and implications of technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, big data, etc. on various corporate governance issues.\n• Students must complete 7 Core Subjects (19 credits) and 4 Elective Subjects (12 credits), i.e. 31 credits.\n• A total of 31 credits are required for the Master of Corporate Governance award.\n• Corporate Governance\n• Corporate Law+\n• Financial Information Analysis\n• Business Risk Management\n• Corporate Compliance\n• Organisation Management and Strategy+\n• Academic Integrity and Ethics in Business (1 credit)\n• Advanced Corporate Governance\n• Business Analytics in Accounting and Finance\n• Contemporary Issues in Accounting Information Systems\n• Corporate Taxation and Tax Planning+\n• Securities Regulations and Practice\n• Strategic China Tax Planning and Management\n• Economics of Sustainability\n• Regulatory Framework\n• Economic Law and System of the PRC\n• Corporate Administration+\n• A Bachelor’s degree from a recognised university, or the equivalent.\n• Preference will be given to applicants with relevant working experience, but it is not a must.\n• Classes are normally scheduled on weekday daytime and / or evening.\n• Non-local students must obtain a valid student visa issued by the Hong Kong Immigration Department before being allowed to register as students or commence study with PolyU.\n• Copies of certificates of your membership(s) with professional bodies, if any.\n• Applicants with any non-English certificates should also submit a set of corresponding official English-translated copies for reference.\n• PolyU Main Site\n• Academic Registry (AR)\n• Global Engagement Office (GEO)\n• Graduate School (GS)\n• Office of Undergraduate Studies (OUS)\n• Student Affairs Office (SAO)\n• Hong Kong Community College (HKCC)\n• School of Professional Education and Executive Development (SPEED)\n• JUPAS\n• School Nominations Direct Admission Scheme (SNDAS)",

      "content": "[HEADING] Quick Access\nFinancial Assistance\nEligible local students (please see here) may apply for the HKSAR Government's Extended Non-means-tested Loan Scheme (ENLS). The scheme offers interest-bearing loans to eligible students for covering tuition fees. An administrative fee and a relatively higher interest rate are charged once the loan is drawn down until it is fully repaid. Applications are non-means tested, which means that there is no assessment of family's income and assets. For details of the scheme, please refer to the Government's website at https://www.wfsfaa.gov.hk/sfo/en/postsecondary/enls/overview.htm.\nAlso, there are some PolyU subjects/courses that have been approved for the Continuing Education Fund (CEF). Eligible students (please see here) enrolled in courses included on the Government's list of reimbursable courses may apply for subsidies. Please refer to the Continuing Education Fund website at https://www.wfsfaa.gov.hk/cef/en/index.htm for information.\nNon-local students are not eligible to apply for financial assistance from both the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and PolyU.
