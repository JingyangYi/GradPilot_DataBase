      "content": "[HEADING] Master of Science in Business Analytics Admissions\n[HEADING] Fall 2026 Application Deadlines\n[HEADING] Application Materials\nAdmission decisions to the MSBA program are based on a holistic review of your previous academic accomplishments, work experience, test scores, essays, resume, reference letters, and demonstrated potential for graduate and professional success.\nApplications for the Fall 2026 semester will open on September 1, 2025. Complete this form to be notified once we start accepting applications.\nAre you a current student or alumni at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign? Check out the benefits of a Gies Business Fast Track Application.\nIt’s simple to apply online for the MS Business Analytics program. To speed up the process, here’s what you’ll need:\nStart with creating your Graduate College application online. Choose your program: Business Analytics, then Business Analytics – MS as degree.\n(1) Unofficial Transcripts: The most recent unofficial transcripts must include applicant's name, institution name, and a transcript legend, grade scale, or grade criteria. GPA calculation is administered by the Graduate College (WES report is not needed). If an offer of admission is made, the official transcript(s) are required to be submitted upon arrival to campus.\n(2) Diploma/Certificate of Degree: If you have earned a bachelor’s degree, please upload a copy of your certificate of degree/provisional certificate of degree/diploma.\nU.S. Bachelor’s Equivalence: All international candidates should check the Illinois Graduate College Admissions Requirements for a Country to ensure your education meets the eligibility requirements for admission.\n3-year Bachelor’s Degree from India: For Fall 2025, all three-year bachelor’s degrees from an accredited institution in India will be accepted as a comparable bachelor’s degree in the U.S.. You will not need a post-graduate diploma or significant work experience to be considered for admission.\nYour professional résumé should include educational background and work/internship experience (include start and end date). You may also include professional certificates/associations and community services. 2 pages maximum.\nAll MSBA applicants should upload a course form that records all quantitative/coding skills acquired through academic and professional experience.\nThis form allows the MSBA program to understand any prior quantitative/analytics coursework you have completed or are working on, in order to support your individualized study plan once you are enrolled in the program. Please note this is not a “pre-requisite” form.\nYour official GRE/GMAT scores must be sent directly to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign: Institution Code – 1836.\nGRE/GMAT Waivers: You can be granted a waiver if you meet any of the following criteria:\nImportant Notes:\nThe following essays are required to be submitted within your application.\nApplicants are expected to write authentic responses to these prompts. While AI and search engine services can provide guidance and suggestions, admissions committees are looking for your unique experiences and perspectives. AI generated responses will not be accepted.\nAcademic Statement of Purpose: Please write a statement that answers the following questions. Limit your total response to 500 words.\nShort Personal Statements 1 & 2:\nThere is extra space for you to touch upon additional topics you would like to address in your application. Please note that submitting an optional essay itself does not give you advantages in the evaluation process.\nThe first prompt is strongly recommended for applicants with a GPA of 3.0 or lower.\nThere is a video component in the application which will present 3 randomly assigned questions for you to briefly answer in 3 minutes, and allow you to speak directly to the admissions committee via a recorded response. This video component is required for your application. If you run into technical issues, please contact grad@business.illinois.edu.\nIf the application materials and video essay don’t provide enough information for an admission decision, the admissions committee may conduct a small number of invitation-only interviews. Admission decisions may be made with or without an interview.\nChoose two references from academic and/or professional sources. Once you enter their information and institution/company email address into the online application, they will be notified to submit a letter of reference on your behalf. All letters of reference should be signed and dated by the recommender.\nAny reference letters or standardized test scores received more than 7 days after the submission deadline will result in the application being moved to the next round decision date.\nAt Gies College of Business, we are committed to breaking down barriers and making high-quality business education affordable and accessible to as many learners as possible. To support this, there are a limited number of merit and need-based scholarships* available to cover partial tuition. To apply, choose “Yes” at the “Financial Aid” section. You can then fill out the scholarship acknowledgment. The scholarship acknowledgment must be received with the application for full consideration for the scholarship.\n*Please note that we do not offer  scholarships that cover 50% or more of your tuition, nor provide teaching, research, or graduate assistant jobs that would waive your tuition fees.\nThe nonrefundable application fee for domestic candidates is $70 and $90 for international candidates.

To support this, there are a limited number of merit and need-based scholarships* available to cover partial tuition. To apply, choose “Yes” at the “Financial Aid” section. You can then fill out the scholarship acknowledgment. The scholarship acknowledgment must be received with the application for full consideration for the scholarship.\n*Please note that we do not offer  scholarships that cover 50% or more of your tuition, nor provide teaching, research, or graduate assistant jobs that would waive your tuition fees.\nThe nonrefundable application fee for domestic candidates is $70 and $90 for international candidates. Applications received without payment of this fee cannot be processed. The application fee cannot be refunded.\nIf you are a non-native English speaker or do not meet one of the Graduate College’s exemptions, you will need to upload your TOEFL, IELTS, or Duolingo scores directly to your application. Official English proficiency score reports are required for admission and must be dated after August 1, 2023.\nYour official TOEFL scores can be sent electronically to the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (Institution Code – 1836). For more information, please review the Graduate College’s English Proficiency Requirements.\nIs Limited-Status Admission “Conditional Admission”? If you provide a score above the minimum for limited status, but not full status, you are considered to have fully met our admission requirements. However, you will be required to take an English Placement Test (EPT) upon arrival to campus. The results of this test will determine if you need to take any English as a Second Language (ESL) coursework. You may be required to take the EPT and any subsequent ESL coursework during your first year of enrollment. This is considered a degree requirement and not a condition of admission.\nPassport and proof of funding are not required for application review, but will be needed if you are offered admission. International students are required to show proof of funding for living expenses in addition to all tuition and fees. Detailed amount needed for the program can be found on page two of the Declaration and Certification of Finances Form.\n• You are a University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign alumni or current student\n• You have more than two years of full-time work experience in business analytics or data analytics\n• You have an undergraduate GPA of 3.3 or higher on a 4.0 scale (equivalent to B+ or above average grades) at the time of application from an accredited institution in one of the following disciplines: Biological Sciences*, Business, Economics, Physical Sciences,\nMathematical Sciences, Computer and Information Sciences, Geosciences, Engineering, or related technology fields.*Exceptions may apply.\n• The admissions committee reserves the right to request GRE/GMAT scores if they need additional material to assess your qualifications.\n• You may still apply to the MSBA program without a GRE/GMAT, but a lack of test score may have a negative impact on your admissibility.\n• How has your academic and professional background, including any professional training, prepared you for graduate study?\n• How will our program help you achieve your intellectual and professional goals?\n• What are your academic interests, and why do you wish to pursue graduate studies in this specific program?\n• Please describe pivotal experiences, opportunities, and/or challenges (including any financial or access barriers) that have influenced your educational and professional development.
