      "content": "[HEADING] Texas Residents\n[HEADING] Non-Texas Residents\n[HEADING] Fund Your Way with Financial Aid\nThe Texas McCombs Master of Science for Working Professionals program offers an incredible value for students pursuing their graduate degree in business.\nTotal Cost: $50,500\nCost Details:\n*Not included above, a non-refundable $2,000 pre-enrollment tuition fee is required once an applicant accepts our offer of admission in order to secure a seat in the program.\n**Tuition does not include insurance, books, living expenses, other fees​.\nTotal Cost: $55,500\nCost Details:\nWe understand that graduate school is an investment. All students admitted to Specialized Master’s programs have access to a financial aid team to help secure funding, and can learn more about financial aid through McCombs Financial Services.\nIf you are a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, you’ll likely be eligible for federal student loans. To determine your eligibility, you must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).\nThe FAFSA is available October 1 of each year for the next school year and it is recommended that you have both the current year and next year’s FAFSAs completed no later than June 1st prior to when your program begins. The UT Austin School Code is 003658.\nOnce your FAFSA(s) have been successfully processed, you will be offered federal loans to cover your full estimated cost of attendance for the summer, fall, and spring semesters.\nYou can check the status of your FAFSA after it has been submitted by visiting the “Status/Requirements” page in your Check Aid Status Here (CASH) portal. We will begin packaging McCombs students’ financial aid in June for the upcoming aid year. If you do not receive a Financial Aid Notification (FAN) by the end of June, please feel free to email us at FinancialAid@mccombs.utexas.edu.\nIf you choose to pursue a private loan, we recommend applying no sooner than a few months before the start of your program. Ethically, we cannot recommend a lender; you must do research to find lenders who meet your needs. Most private loans are credit-based, and the approval decision may expire. Check with your lender about the length of time your application will remain valid before you apply.\nWhen applying, you must use loan periods that match what is used by The Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid (OSFA) for processing loans. If your lender provides pre-selected loan periods, we recommend you contact the lender to get the loan periods on your application updated to match what UT Austin uses.\nYou can opt to apply for each semester individually, but you can also group fall and spring together as fall/spring. Summer loans require a separate application and cannot be grouped with any other semester. For example, you cannot have any of the following combinations: summer/fall, spring/summer, summer/fall/spring, or fall/spring/summer.\nPlease use the following loan periods as needed during your time in the program.\nPlease note: academic years (i.e. fall and spring) cannot be grouped together, so you will have to apply for each year separately. Please use the following loan periods as needed based on when your program begins and ends.\nIf you have questions about the loan itself, contact your lender.\nIf you have an issue with the processing of your private loan, please email us at FinancialAid@mccombs.utexas.edu and include your UT EID and program in your email.\nThere are a limited number of scholarships available to Texas McCombs Specialized Master’s students.

To support you through the process, we offer a dedicated financial aid team who will help you explore ways to finance your degree. As the #1 ranked Working Professional MBA program in Texas and top-10 in the U.S., your degree will start paying dividends immediately.\nThis information reflects program cost information for the Evening MBA class entering in August 2025. For students beginning the program in future years, tuition is expected to increase by approximately 3-5%. Returning students will not experience a rate change or increase as their tuition will remain the same for the entire time in the program.\n(entering August 2025)\nA non-refundable $2,000 deposit is required once an applicant accepts our offer of admission in order to secure a seat in the program. The deposit will be credited toward your first semester’s program costs. Payments for each semester’s tuition and fees are due approximately six weeks before each semester begins.\nCost of attendance ensures access to top-rated McCombs School of Business resources for working professionals and world-class faculty. Our program is delivered in a format that enables you to maintain full-time employment while pursuing your degree.\nTexas McCombs Working Professional MBA students leverage a mix of federal loans, private loans, scholarships, employer benefits, and savings to finance their degree. Learn about different financial aid options to see which is right for you.\nIf you are a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, you will likely be eligible for federal student loans.\nTo determine your eligibility, you must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).\nOnce your FAFSA has been successfully processed, you will be offered enough federal loans to cover your program costs each semester.

If your lender provides pre-selected loan periods, we recommend you contact the lender to get the loan periods on your application updated to match what UT Austin uses.\nYou can opt to apply for each semester individually, but you can also group fall and spring together as fall/spring. Summer loans require a separate application and cannot be grouped with any other semester.

Please use the following loan periods as needed based on when your program begins and ends.\nIf you have questions about the loan itself, contact your lender.\nIf you have an issue with the processing of your private loan, please email us at FinancialAid@mccombs.utexas.edu and include your UT EID and program in your email.\nThere are some loan options for international students. More favorable loan terms may be available if you have a U.S. citizen or permanent resident as a co-signer. There are a few lenders that do not require a U.S. co-signer for approval, but the loan terms are typically less preferable.\nThe University of Texas at Austin cannot co-sign on any loans, and as a public institution, we are unable to recommend any specific lenders. We advise searching online and speaking to current students or alumni to see what options may be available for your.

For example, you cannot have any of the following combinations: summer/fall, spring/summer, summer/fall/spring, or fall/spring/summer.\nPlease use the following loan periods as needed during your time in the program.\nPlease note: academic years (i.e. fall and spring) cannot be grouped together, so you will have to apply for each year separately. Please use the following loan periods as needed based on when your program begins and ends.\n\nSummer 2025: 6/5/25 – 8/18/25\nFall 2025: 8/19/25 – 1/10/26\nSpring 2026: 1/12/26 – 6/3/26\nFall 2025/Spring 2026: 8/19/25 – 6/3/25\nSummer 2026: 6/4/26 – 1/9/27\nFall 2026: 8/18/26 – 1/9/27\nSpring 2027: 1/11/27 – 6/2/27\nFall 2026/Spring 2027: 8/18/26 – 6/2/27\n\nIf you have questions about the loan itself, contact your lender. \nIf you have an issue with the processing of your private loan, please email us at FinancialAid@mccombs.utexas.edu and include your UT EID and program in your email.\nInternational Student Loans\nThere are some loan options for international students. More favorable loan terms may be available if you have a U.S. citizen or permanent resident as a co-signer. There are a few lenders that do not require a U.S. co-signer for approval, but the loan terms are typically less preferable.\nThe University of Texas at Austin cannot co-sign on any loans, and as a public institution, we are unable to recommend any specific lenders. We advise searching online and speaking to current students or alumni to see what options may be available for your. Once you choose a lender, we are able to work with all banks and lending institutions to process your loan.\nHave you or your spouse been living and working in Texas for at least a year?\nIf so, it is possible that you could be considered an International Texas Resident. If you are able to establish domicile and be classified as a Texas Resident, you may have additional options to secure funding.\n\nReview the list of eligible visas that may allow you to establish domicile, and please refer to the Texas Residency office for more information about establishing domicile.\nIf you or your spouse is on an eligible visa, please contact us at FinancialAid@mccombs.utexas.edu to discuss your situation.\nMcCombs Admissions Scholarships\nThe McCombs School of Business offers a limited number of Admissions Recruiting Award scholarships to Working Professional MBA students in our MBA at Dallas/Fort Worth, MBA at Houston, and Evening MBA.
