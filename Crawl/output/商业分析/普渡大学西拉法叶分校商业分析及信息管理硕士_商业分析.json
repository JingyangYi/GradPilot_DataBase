The business school awards approximately $800,000 in scholarships each year to undergraduate students, made possible by the generosity of our alumni and friends.\nAll incoming undergraduate students will be evaluated for business school scholarships as long as they apply by November 1 their senior year of high school. There is no separate application.\nScholarship recipients are selected by a scholarship committee that uses a holistic review of the student. Some scholarships may be given based on financial need as determined by the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). We encourage all students to complete the FAFSA by February 15 in order to maximize consideration for all federal, state, and institutional funds they may be eligible to receive.\nVisit the Purdue Division of Financial Aid for:\nVisit the Division of Financial Aid\nReach out to the Daniels School of Business Undergraduate Recruiting Team!\nWe are here to help you through this process.\nContact Recruiting Team\nAll undergraduate students who complete their application for admission by November 1 are automatically considered for university-wide merit scholarships.\nTo be considered for additional scholarships like Stamps Scholars or Beering Scholars, you can apply to the John Martinson Honors College when you apply to Purdue through the Common App.\nThrough the Lilly Scholars at Purdue program, a selection of talented incoming undergraduate students will benefit from a long-standing partnership between the university and Eli Lilly and Company. The Daniels School has four STEM undergraduate programs — Business Analytics and Information Management; Economics; Integrated Business and Engineering (IBE); and Supply Chain and Operations Management — and students in these majors are given preference.\nIn your application portal there is a Scholarship Universe portal which may have supplemental Purdue scholarships matching to a student and a list of outside scholarships.\nStudents will learn about scholarships from the Daniels School in their financial aid package, sent out beginning in April.\nInformation about other university scholarships may be in a student’s admission decision.\n“My scholarship made a difference not only to my financial life, but in my outlook on myself. It meant the world to me to know that my school believed in me. You’re told you’re good enough by friends and family, but to hear it from your own institution brings such a confidence boost.”\nAbbie Griffiths General Management & Marketing, Class of 2022\nIf you are interested in giving to the Daniels School and would like information about supporting students through scholarships, please visit our Giving page.\n• FAFSA tips\n• Portal to submit the FAFSA\n• Call Center information\n• Much more\n[CARD]\nVisit the Purdue Division of Financial Aid for:\n[CARD]\nContact Recruiting Team",
