      "content": "[HEADING] FAQ\n[HEADING] Program\n[HEADING] Admissions\n[HEADING] Campus Life\nThere is one intake every year. The Fall Term starts in September at the HKUST campus.\nThe intake is expected to be around 60-90 students.\nFor a 2-credit course, there are a total of 28 contact hours. There is usually one class per week for each course, so it takes 8 weeks (with the final week allotted for examination) to complete a course of 2 credits\nYes, but credits for exempted courses have to be replaced by electives. Some courses can be exempted for students who have obtained certain qualifications with proof provided, such as transcripts and syllabuses of courses taken within the past 7 years, when the content and level of the previous courses are equivalent to those of the exempted courses and satisfactory grades were achieved. Subject to the approval of the MSBA Academic Director, students may apply for credit transfer of no more than three (3) courses (6 credits) in the program.\nWe normally do not encourage students to extend their length of study. However, we do offer study extensions for students who cannot complete the program within the defined timeframe because of health reasons.\nThe part-time study mode is mostly for working executives in Hong Kong or nearby regions. It takes normally two years to complete for the part-time program. Students in the part-time study mode are recommended to have at least two years of full-time post-qualification work experience.\nThe students of the full-time study mode are mostly recent graduates or junior professionals who dedicate their full attention to the master study. Student can complete the program in one year.\nYes, students who do not have the right to reside in Hong Kong are required to apply for a student visa for entering into Hong Kong and studying a full-time master degree program. The Program Office will coordinate with the Fok Ying Tung Graduate School to arrange student visas for all incoming students upon admission and prior to the commencement of the program.\nYes, you have to submit the online application form including application fees, and copies of supporting documents by the application deadline. Only scanned copies of the supporting documents are required at the application stage. It is strongly recommended that applicants make use of the document uploading function on the online application platform to submit soft copies of documents.\nThe GMAT or GRE are highly recommended for application and you are required to take TOEFL or IELTS unless your first language is English or your qualification is awarded by a university or an institute where the language of instruction is English. You are advised to have the test scores ready when you submit the application. Otherwise, please schedule your tests as early as possible and put your scheduled test date on the application. In any case, you should submit your scores within one month after the application deadline.\nIf you are being admitted, you are required to show the original documents and/or submit the certified true copies, with official imprint and signature, by the issuing authorities.\nGMAT/GRE is NOT a compulsory requirement for application and hence we do not have a minimum score requirement. Applicants’ English ability will also be assessed during a face-to-face interview.\nGMAT/GRE is NOT a compulsory requirement for application but we highly recommend applicants to take GMAT/GRE. As applicants come from different academic backgrounds, different education institutions, and different countries of origin, the GMAT/GRE score allows us to assess their academic ability to participate in an international program. Extensive research also supports the GMAT/GRE as a consistent measure of how well an applicant will handle postgraduate studies, particularly required courses.\nIf an applicant does not have GMAT or GRE scores, his/her English level will still be assessed during the interview.\nAgain, as GMAT/GRE is NOT compulsory requirement for application. If you decide to take the GMAT/GRE examinations, you could first submit your application and indicate in the application form your scheduled test date. Once an unofficial GMAT/GRE score report is available right after the test, you may upload the report in the application system for our reference.\nYour GMAT/GRE result is valid for 5 years prior to the commencement of study.\nA TOEFL/IELTS score is required if your first language is not English or your degree or equivalent qualification was awarded by an institution where the medium of instruction is not English.\nFor TOEFL, a score of 550 (paper test) or 80 (Internet test) is required. For IELTS, a minimum score of 6.5 is required.\nYour TOEFL/IELTS result is valid for 2 years prior to the commencement of study.\nYou do not have to apply for the Admission Scholarship. Every applicant is considered by the Admission Committee for the admission offer and scholarship simultaneously. Applicants, who receive and accept the admission offer, will be considered for the Admission Scholarship.\nAs two reference letters are required, you should nominate two referees who know you well and can inform the University about your academic ability, character and capacity for postgraduate studies. The instructors from the courses of your undergraduate/postgraduate studies and/or the current or past employers/supervisors are also eligible to be your referees.\nYes. A face-to-face interview or video interview via internet will be arranged for shortlisted candidates residing in Hong Kong. Phone interview requests are not accepted.\nOn-campus accommodation at HKUST is not available due to heavy demand. Students will have to explore short-term off-campus accommodation. The University’s Student Housing Office will help to provide information on short-term off-campus housing options for non-local students.\nWe strongly recommend that students have laptops. There are, however, several computer barns on campus equipped with over 100 computers. Those who intend to buy a laptop can join the laptop scheme on campus (discounted sales of laptop computers to students at the beginning of the academic year), though it will take some time before the product can be picked up.\nThe campus is just 10 minutes’ ride away from the nearest Mass Transit Railway (MTR) station at Hang Hau. A supermarket, banks, bookstore and food outlets are also available on campus. The city center, Central, can be accessed by bus or mini-bus from campus within 45 minutes.\n• Home\n• Admission\n• Home\n• Admission\n• GMATHong Kong University of Science and TechnologyHKUST Business SchoolOther Masters, Full Time\n• GRE3834\n• TOEFL0170\n• IELTSName of department: Postgradute Outreach and Admissions TeamName of institution: The Hong Kong University of Science and TechnologyAddress: Room 6418, Lift 25-26 Academic Building, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong",

      "content": "[HEADING] What's Happening\n[HEADING] Navigating the World of Big Data\nBig data has quickly become the new buzz word of the 21st Century. Especially as all sorts of businesses begin to realize the immense value of data, the demand for data analysts or data engineers grows by the day.\nData roles today are no longer limited to statistics and the workings of basic computer science, it’s now evolved into a new business role where talents must have the skills beyond simply utilizing automated processes. This means that those roles have now evolved to add value to companies that need to assess their data to support business decision making and identify optimum business solutions.\nIn reaction to this commercialization of big data and its manpower demand, the HKUST Business School has rolled out a one-year full-time or two-year part-time Master of Science degree program in Business Analytics (MSBA).\n“MSBA graduates leave with much more than the typical technical skills to execute data analytics, but also with developed data-analytic thinking, business acumen, and communication skills to take on front office roles and take part in the process of leveraging data for adding value to their firm or clients,” Prof. Lancelot James, Chair Professor and MSBA Academic Director said.\nTaught by world-class faculty from around the world, the program boasts a cutting-edge curriculum that provides students with a solid knowledge of business analytics by bringing together a wide range of knowledge in Applied Statistics, Modelling, Optimization, and Information Management.\nAs a result, students who leave the program are well equipped with data analytic skills that optimize business performance and allow them to apply real business problems in areas such as consulting, finance, management, and marketing.\nIndeed, data specialists with relevant formal business training have shown to play a significant role in the consulting industry in recent years. As such, the program has stepped up in introducing analytics consulting and management courses to the curriculum in response to this growing demand in the industry.\nAs a further result, graduates of the program are competent in integrating cross-disciplinary knowledge with analytics to manage complex data structures in a business environment, analyze real business problems, and play leading roles in successful business strategy execution using analytics.\nIn this way, students are able to step into the workplace with the skills and knowledge to use data to achieve competitiveness and further aspire to be a team leader. Furthermore, they are able to see the value of understanding data within a business mindset as a key takeaway of the program.\n“I acquired several hard-core skills in data analytics and modeling. Most importantly, I learned how to break down and synthesize problems in different scenarios which has benefitted me in my career journey in management consulting,” Joyce Wu, a graduate from the 2017 cohort, who now works at McKinsey & Company, Hong Kong as an Assistant Manager, said.\nTo further help graduates navigate a real-world environment, the MSBA program is famed for providing plenty of opportunities and platforms for students to network with industry practitioners and senior management to get insight and seek out career opportunities.\nThe popular MSBA Enrichment Workshops have seen experts from all sorts of industries share their learnings through talks, seminars, faculty symposiums, company visits and networking events.\nSome of the more recent events include an enrichment workshop by Benjamin Chow, Head of Analytics for Asia for Real Capital Analytics, who talked about how data analytics is transforming the real estate industry. Students got the opportunity to hear about how data is now driving the real estate markets as well as gained valuable insights into recent capital market trends.\nOn other fronts, students also got to interact and hear from two Kellogg-HKUST Executive MBA alumni, Khai San Banh and Akihiko Katayama, on their experiences in starting a business analytics advisory firm, Sprint Milestone. They got to hear all about how they used their extensive data analytics experiences in banking combined with automation, analytics and AI solutions to provide insights to their clients. The alumni sharing has now also turned into a meaningful collaboration of a programming workshop from Sprint Milestone. Students of the workshop will get the chance to continually interact with the senior executives and find out how they can execute programming skills and apply them to real business cases.\nTurning to the highly profitable world of gaming, the program invited Andrew Pearson, Founder and Managing Director of Intelligencia Limited, to deliver a powerful and insightful talk into how gaming executives can utilize AI to help fine-tune campaigns and gain market segments while optimizing their overall operations.\nOn top of these enrichment opportunities, on-site visits and tours are also regularly arranged allowing students to experience all kinds of outside class activities that help them to gain a better understanding of the industry landscape in person. According to MSBA Alumna Mora Lin, these visits allowed her to understand how data can be applied across different industries.\n“It allowed us to think about our career prospects,” she said. “Most graduates become business analysts, data scientists and many go into consulting.”\nBut ultimately, “whichever career path students choose to take, it’s the exposure to a breadth of real-world problems and gaining the insight into how to tackle these issues that will give students a leg up”, said Prof. Lancelot.\nAnd if that’s not enough, students will also receive incredible support to help spearhead their career paths in a digital era. Support will come through the program’s career services, which offers workshops, career fairs, career treks, 1-on-1 coaching, resume polishing, and even job postings & weekly career newsletters.\n• Home\n• What's Happening\n• Home\n• What's Happening",
