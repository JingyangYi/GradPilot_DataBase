If you do not wish to test or believe your test score does not reflect your ability and potential for graduate study, please do not include a score. You will indicate whether you wish to submit a test score on the application.\nIf you decide to submit a score, you can self-report your score on the application, but you should also have your official score sent directly to Johns Hopkins Carey Business School. We accept scores from both the GMAT and the GRE that are up to five years old and do not have a preference for either test.
