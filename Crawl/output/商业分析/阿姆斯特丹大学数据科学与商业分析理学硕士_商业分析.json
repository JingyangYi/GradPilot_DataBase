Leading experts will challenge you to discuss and reflect on theories, examine case studies and work with advanced software. Most of your teachers execute world-class research and will share their latest techniques and practices with you. Future employers will reward your MSc degree with a Master’s degree worthy starting salary and a wide range of promotion opportunities.\nYou have a full academic year to successfully complete the 36 ECTS credits programme. Throughout the year, you can expect excellent teaching and support from our professors, each highly respected in their field of expertise.\nFor your convenience, we selected a fixed set of 6 courses for you. These form an excellent preparation for any of the 2 tracks you will later on choose within the Master's Data Science and Business Analytics.\nGain fundamental insights into classical mathematical statistics and learn to work with basic statistical models.\nGet acquainted with Machine Learning. Learn to discriminate between different machine learning and pattern recognition methods, apply methods on different types of data and evaluate their performance using different metrics.\nLearn how to formulate mathematical models for practical problems such as a linear programming (LP) problem, perform a sensitivity analysis for LP problems and solve integer programming problems.\nLearn how to develop the multiple regression model with applications, especially to cross-sectional data. Make extensive use of matrix algebra and multivariate statistical theory. Use software packages EViews and R or Python for the execution of applications and simulations.\nGet a broad introduction to modern finance, theoretical and empirical, with focus on the assessment of investment projects and the way to finance them as well as the fundamental relationship between risk and return by presenting modern portfolio theory and the capital asset pricing model (CAPM).\nLearn about the parts of univariate and multivariate time series analysis that are most relevant for analysing and forecasting (macro)economic and financial time series.\nThe entry requirements for this pre-Master’s programme depend on your previous academic education.\nYour eligibility is based on the following criteria:\nWe do not require a specific minimum GPA for this programme, but we will compare and assess the performance on all selection criteria to make an informed decision regarding placement into the programme.\nStudents with an EU academic degree + EU nationality:\nOther test versions or modules are not accepted. Examples of this include but are not limited to: IELTS Indicator, IELTS One Skill Retake, TOEFL Home Edition, TOEFL MyBest Scores, etc.\nTest scores may not be older than 2 years, counting back from the start of the programme.
