Not all optional modules are available every year.\nIn this era of unprecedented data and computational power, analytics is proving to be the cornerstone of ever-growing areas of organisational decision-making, be it, for example, for businesses to compete or for public sector organisations to innovate. There are several aspects in applying analytics to real business and decision-making scenarios and problems. These not only include computational and analytical methodologies but also how to systematically structure problems and effectively communicate results. A key ability expected of an analyst or analytics practitioner is to have a good idea and understanding of how these aspects of analytic decision-making play together in any given context. Hence, the aim of this module is to enable you to develop analytic thinking at a holistic level and the ability to conduct analytical projects in a real-world context.\nAfter introducing the topic of forecasting in business organisations, issues concerned with forecasting model building in regression and its extensions are presented, building on material covered earlier in the course(s). Extrapolative forecasting methods, in particular Exponential Smoothing, are then considered, as well as Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence methods, in particular Neural Networks. All methods are embedded in a case study in forecasting in organisations. The course ends by analysing how forecasting is applied to operations and how forecasting can best be improved in an organisational context.\nThis module provides an introduction to business analytics, management science and related disciplines, with a particular emphasis on the modelling and solution of real-world problems. It includes an introduction to three very useful approaches: optimisation, stochastic modelling and simulation.Several examples and case studies will be given to illustrate how the approaches can be used in practice. Students will also be shown how to implement models in a spreadsheet. Some hands-on experience with Excel, including the development of simple macros, will be given.\nPython is a simple, yet very powerful, high-level computer programming language that is extremely popular today. It is widely used in many scientific areas for data exploration whilst being the preferred programming language in a range of modern organisations.\nThis module will cover a range of the most commonly used algorithms and techniques, including sorting and searching algorithms, data manipulation, visualisation and the use of package extensions such as pandas and numpty, as well as applications in Business Analytics such as simulation and optimisation.\nAt the heart of many management problems lies data that need to be described, analysed and interpreted. The overall objective of this module is to develop the students’ abilities to describe, analyse and interpret data soundly, making effective use of computer software. The skills learned on this course underpin many of the other modules on the Management Science Department programmes. Although the module assumes little prior knowledge of statistics, those with prior knowledge should not expect to find it easy.\nThis module offers you a valuable opportunity to research a real business problem for an organisation, delivering a viable and well-documented solution to the client. For a successful project, you will employ your knowledge of methods (qualitative/quantitative), problem scoping and the research literature to your knowledge and understanding of professional engagement both in their interactions with the client and in the reporting of their outputs and discourse on your research.\nThe aim of this module is to provide students with a valuable opportunity to research an area of your degree programme in-depth, linking this to business problems that arise in the real world. For a successful project, you will employ their knowledge of analytical methods, problem scoping, modelling and the research literature to identify and implement a solution approach to the business problem or expand on your knowledge of the state of the area being researched. Throughout the project, you will develop your knowledge and understanding of professional academic engagement both in your interactions with your supervisor and in the reporting of your outputs and discourse on your research.\nThe module provides an introduction to the fundamental methods and approaches from the interrelated areas of data mining, statistical/ machine learning, and intelligent data analysis. It covers the entire data analysis process, starting from the formulation of a project objective, developing an understanding of the available data and other resources, up to the point of statistical modelling and performance assessment. The focus of the module is classification and uses the R programming language.\nThis module introduces you to the basic principles of marketing and places particular emphasis on the role of analytical modelling in supporting marketing decisions in organisations. It is hoped that you will be in a position at the end of this course to fully appreciate how analytical models enable managers to make better marketing decisions instead of relying on their intuition or gut feel.\nTopics covered include Marketing Mix Models (MMM) and text mining and are supported by workshops, which will offer opportunities to build up modelling skills. These will be done in R (or equivalently other open-source statistical programming languages, such as Python).\nThe Operations Management discipline has traditionally been concerned with how organisations achieve excellence in processes and operations, and to this end several (continuous) improvement approaches and tools and techniques have been stressed. The interest in intra-firm improvement and excellence has more recently been extended to address also how firms can improve their operations in coordination with their supply chain counterparts. This has become relevant since specialisation of labour across industries and outsourcing trends entail that a large share of the value of products and services is created outside the focal firm.\nThis module provides an understanding of both intra- and inter-organisational approaches to operations improvement and excellence. In particular, it address: a) improvement tools and techniques that firms implement primarily in their internal operations, and b) supply processes and capabilities required to improve operations and achieve excellence in coordination with supply chain partners. The themes above are addressed both in manufacturing and service industries and cross private and public sector settings.\nOptimisation, sometimes called mathematical programming, has applications in many fields, including operational research, computer science, statistics, finance, engineering and the physical sciences. Commercial optimisation software is now capable of solving many industrial-scale problems to proven optimality.\nThe module is designed to enable students to apply optimisation techniques to business problems. Building on the introduction to optimisation in the first term, students will be introduced to different problem formulations and algorithmic methods to guide decision making in business and other organisations.\nComputer simulation methods are among the most commonly used approaches within Operational Research. Modern simulation packages are a valuable aid in building a simulation model and this module will emphasise the practical application of simulation, with a good understanding of how a simulation model works being an essential part of this. Stochastic modelling methods provide analytical tools which enable Operational Researchers to gain insight into complicated and unpredictable real-world processes. The application of these methods requires careful consideration of the dynamics of the real-world situation being modelled, and (in particular) the way that uncertainty evolves.\nSimulation and stochastic modelling are inter-related in several ways. Insights from stochastic modelling can help in the design of simulation models. On the other hand, simulation can be used to investigate the sensitivity of stochastic models to some of their underlying assumptions. A number of fundamental concepts, such as probabilistic variations, steady state behaviour and time-dependent behaviour are common to both areas.\nThe purpose of this course is to understand and use mathematical models in making strategic, tactical, and operational logistics decisions. Emerging logistical concepts will be introduced and the associated mathematical modelling needs will be discussed. Algebraic formulations will be used as vehicle for describing models and discussing their relationships. There will be a focus on modelling, the use of professional software, and the understanding of results. For problems where exact solutions are hard to achieve even for simple instances of the problem, heuristics will be discussed. The main topics covered are: facility location, network design, warehousing, vehicle routing and scheduling, and Terminal (airport) capacity management.\nDepending on students need and level of programming skill, the computer workshops will focus on either solver languages (e.g. GAMS, AMPL, MPL) and/or programming interfaces (PYOMO, CPLEX Concert, Gurobi Python Interface).\nThere may be extra costs related to your course for items such as books, stationery, printing, photocopying, binding and general subsistence on trips and visits.

accordion\n\n\n\n        Additional costs\n    \n\n\nThere may be extra costs related to your course for items such as books, stationery, printing, photocopying, binding and general subsistence on trips and visits. Following graduation, you may need to pay a subscription to a professional body for some chosen careers.\nSpecific additional costs for studying at Lancaster are listed below.\nCollege fees\nLancaster is proud to be one of only a handful of UK universities to have a collegiate system. Every student belongs to a college, and all students pay a small College Membership Fee which supports the running of college events and activities. Students on some distance-learning courses are not liable to pay a college fee. \nFor students starting in 2025, the fee is £40 for undergraduates and research students and £15 for students on one-year courses.\nComputer equipment and internet access\nTo support your studies, you will also require access to a computer, along with reliable internet access. You will be able to access a range of software and services from a Windows, Mac, Chromebook or Linux device. For certain degree programmes, you may need a specific device, or we may provide you with a laptop and appropriate software - details of which will be available on relevant programme pages. A dedicated IT support helpdesk is available in the event of any problems.\nThe University provides limited financial support to assist students who do not have the required IT equipment or broadband support in place.\n\n\n        Application fees and tuition fee deposits\n    \n\n\nApplication fees for 2025For most taught postgraduate programmes starting in 2025 you must pay a non-refundable application fee of £40. We cannot consider applications until this fee has been paid, as advised on our online secure payment system. There is no application fee for postgraduate research applications.Application fees for 2026There is no application fee if you are applying for postgraduate study starting in 2026.Paying a depositFor some of our courses you will need to pay a deposit to accept your offer and secure your place. We will let you know in your offer letter if a deposit is required and you will be given a deadline date when this is due to be paid.\n\n\n        What is my fee status?\n    \n\n\nThe fee that you pay will depend on whether you are considered to be a home or international student. Read more about how we assign your fee status.\n\n\n        Fees in subsequent years\n    \n\n\nIf you are studying on a programme of more than one year’s duration, tuition fees are reviewed annually and are not fixed for the duration of your studies. Read more about fees in subsequent years.\n\n\n        More information\n    \n\n\nFind all fees and funding information for students at Lancaster University.\n[GRID_TABLE]\nSimilar

at Lancaster?\nRichlove talks about why she chose the course and what she has got out of it so far.\n[CARD]\nAnalytics in Practice\nIn this era of unprecedented data and computational power, analytics is proving to be the cornerstone of ever-growing areas of organisational decision-making, be it, for example, for businesses to compete or for public sector organisations to innovate. There are several aspects in applying analytics to real business and decision-making scenarios and problems. These not only include computational and analytical methodologies but also how to systematically structure problems and effectively communicate results. A key ability expected of an analyst or analytics practitioner is to have a good idea and understanding of how these aspects of analytic decision-making play together in any given context. Hence, the aim of this module is to enable you to develop analytic thinking at a holistic level and the ability to conduct analytical projects in a real-world context.\n[CARD]\nDissertation (Industry)\nThis module offers you a valuable opportunity to research a real business problem for an organisation, delivering a viable and well-documented solution to the client. For a successful project, you will employ your knowledge of methods (qualitative/quantitative), problem scoping and the research literature to your knowledge and understanding of professional engagement both in their interactions with the client and in the reporting of their outputs and discourse on your research.\n[CARD]\nAdditional costs\nThere may be extra costs related to your course for items such as books, stationery, printing, photocopying, binding and general subsistence on trips and visits. Following graduation, you may need to pay a subscription to a professional body for some chosen careers.\nSpecific additional costs for studying at Lancaster are listed below.\nCollege fees\nLancaster is proud to be one of only a handful of UK universities to have a collegiate system. Every student belongs to a college, and all students pay a small College Membership Fee which supports the running of college events and activities. Students on some distance-learning courses are not liable to pay a college fee. \nFor students starting in 2025, the fee is £40 for undergraduates and research students and £15 for students on one-year courses.\nComputer equipment and internet access\nTo support your studies, you will also require access to a computer, along with reliable internet access. You will be able to access a range of software and services from a Windows, Mac, Chromebook or Linux device. For certain degree programmes, you may need a specific device, or we may provide you with a laptop and appropriate software - details of which will be available on relevant programme pages. A dedicated IT support helpdesk is available in the event of any problems.\nThe University provides limited financial support to assist students who do not have the required IT equipment or broadband support in place.\n[CARD]\nArnaud Da Silva\nMSc Business Analytics, 2024\n[CARD]\nKaterin Retes\nMSc Business Analytics, 2024\n[CARD]\nAlex Yamamoto\nMSc Business Analytics, 2023\n[CARD]\nJatin Malik\nMSc Business Analytics, 2023\n[CARD]\nDivya Sherwani\nMSc Business Analytics, 2022\n[CARD]\nMuhammad Sabeer Fayyaz\nMSc Business Analytics, 2022",

Five 10-day modules. The International Masters Program for Managers (IMPM) programme breaks the mould to create leaders who can develop people and shape business in a complex and changing global context.\nToday’s senior managers must be negotiators, problem solvers, entrepreneurs, and more. Iconic management thinker Henry Mintzberg co-founded this course 20 years ago to teach these qualities. His ethos is shared by the 75 international faculty members who bring their research and academic concepts to this programme.\nYou will study organisations, self, relationships, change and context at McGill University (Canada), Lancaster University (UK), Yokohama National University (Japan), FGV EBAPE (Brazil), and the Institute of Management Bangalore (India)\nTraditional learning approaches are complemented by cultural experiences such as a yoga class in India or a Zen monastery in Japan, which are designed to help you unlearn behaviours, break down silo mentality and develop new mindsets.\nYou will focus on how to combine your significant functional experience with the ability to pause and reflect, turning that experience into new knowledge. You will also become comfortable with the uncertainty and complexity that accompanies senior positions.\nContributions are made on an equal basis between faculty and students. You are not passive receivers but co-creators. You are also encouraged to share your learning with a project team of up to ten colleagues in your own organisation. After graduation, you can return for two to three days on modules to build another layer of learning. On completion of the programme, there is the option to progress to a Theory and Practice of Management PhD.\nParticipants come from a wide range of industry backgrounds such as engineering, media, telecoms, IT and transport.\nThe IMPM breaks the mould to create world-class executives who can lead their business in a complex and disruptive global context. Today’s senior managers must be astute negotiators, creative problem solvers, discern business trends, act entrepreneurially, and more. Iconic management thinker Henry Mintzberg founded the programme over 20 years ago to help managers think differently, develop their purpose and act wisely.\nThe programme is taught by 75 international faculty from five leading global business schools worldwide with five 1½ week mindset modules over 18 months.\nAuthentically international, this advanced management programme is designed around management mindsets and business challenges.

In Rio de Janeiro, at Brazil’s renowned FGV-EBAPE, the focus is on catalytic change and how business and global dynamics interact with management and organisational action. To develop an advanced and incisive perspective on managerial action, there are sessions on change management, processual perspectives on change and continuity, managing hierarchies for action, governance and knowledge for action across businesses and societal contexts.\nVisits to companies and public sector enterprises, a school for youth development and workshops on diversity and gender, refresh and extend the scope for managerial and organisational action. Enriching concepts and understanding of change and continuity, the module also focuses on learning innovative practices of management and organisational action, with advanced action inquiry techniques such as Friendly Consulting and In-Reach for organisational action learning and impact.\nModule Two - Managing Organisations: The Analytic Mindset‌\nDesautels Faculty of Management, McGill University, Canada\nUnderstanding the role and value of analysis in organisations is a vital capability for senior executives. McGill, one of the world’s top universities, hosts the Analytic Mindset in Montreal, one of North America’s most dynamic and engaging cities. Faculty sessions focus on the role of evidence and experience in business and management, examining how decisions are made and negotiations take place, financial management and business valuation, emerging innovations in artificial intelligence and global cross-cultural awareness.\nThe Analytic Mindset provides techniques for analysing organisations and equips participants with a deep knowledge of different management concepts in relation to strategic thinking. Analysing evidence and experience in strategic thinking and in organisations, workshops on eco-cycle management and the theory of constraints expand analysis beyond function to fusion. Along with taught sessions, visits to companies create a unique learning community of participants dedicated to exploring management mindsets, analytical judgement and impact.\nModule Three - Managing Relationships: The Collaborative Mindset ‌‌\nYokohama National University, Japan\nRelationships are at the centre of successful managerial practice as organisations accomplish purpose and goals in groups, cross-functional teams and with other organisations. Iconic managers and organisations build relationships and learn through others. The third module, the Collaborative Mindset, is provided by Yokohama National University. Yokohama, Japan’s second-largest city, was one of the first ports in Japan which opened to foreign trade. Drawing on a wealth of management expertise in Japan and East Asia, the module focuses on managing relationships between individuals, within teams and across businesses, with strategic alliances, joint ventures and supply chains.\nParticipants learn about world-famous contributions to management thinking such as knowledge creation, wisdom and kaizen in relation to collaboration. Workshops on cross-sector collaboration as well as insights into relationships with nature and new technologies connect to contemporary innovations in robotics and machine learning. Visiting organisations in the private, public and plural sectors sharpen insights into collaboration within and between organisations and across sectors.\nModule One - Managing Self: The Reflective Mindset\nLancaster University Management School\nSenior management development needs to incorporate individuals’ experiences and develop the capability to learn from cycles of experience and reflection. In the first module, the program seeks to expand horizons and perspectives, turning personal, professional and business experience into new practices of thinking and acting. Lancaster and the Lake District in north-western England, the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, is the perfect setting for thoughtful reflection on your personal trajectory, role as a senior manager and the business context of your organisation.\nFaculty sessions include the nature of reflective and engaging management, action inquiry, the art, craft and science of management practice, virtue ethics and responsibility, and business as practical wisdom. Faculty workshops at a historic cotton mill bring alive the role of business models over the long wave of commerce, practising a deliberative corporate business meeting demonstrates group decision-making, and walking in the footsteps of poet William Wordsworth evokes the importance of vision, community and place for creativity and insight in management. Exploring cycles of personal and professional experience, reflection and insight for engaged managing, participants also visit a range of companies to undertake a reflective analysis and learn about managerial values, responsibility and ethics.\nModule Five - Managing Context: The Worldly Mindset\nIndian Institute of Management (IIM), Bangalore\nThe final module capstones the cycles of learning from experience and reflection while continuing to broaden contemporary business expertise and management judgment. Enhancing strategic insight and capabilities for worldly action and impact culminates with the Worldly Mindset at the IIM Bangalore. India is the ideal environment to learn about other people’s mindsets in order to better understand our own and to learn to act in entrepreneurial and worldly ways. Creating worldly managers, leaders and organisations for the future, faculty sessions focus on political dynamics in diverse settings, non-market strategic management, the bottom-of-the-pyramid markets, the role of religious and societal values in business, frugal innovation and inclusive market development, managing sustainably and digitalisation, and sustaining business growth.\nTo cultivate a worldly mindset, participants visit companies focused on technology consulting, digital business, medical innovation and social entrepreneurship to integrate insights from all modules. Field study visits to a microfinance institution and an orchard farm connect learning from nature to network business models and digital platforms. The diversity of the faculty sessions throughout this and other modules, combined with the unique program design, makes for a rich and highly developmental experience which transforms participants and prepares them for senior and wider roles in business and society.\nThe major paper is the culmination of the IMPM programme.

You will be able to access a range of software and services from a Windows, Mac, Chromebook or Linux device. For certain degree programmes, you may need a specific device, or we may provide you with a laptop and appropriate software - details of which will be available on relevant programme pages. A dedicated IT support helpdesk is available in the event of any problems.\nThe University provides limited financial support to assist students who do not have the required IT equipment or broadband support in place.\n\n\n        Application fees and tuition fee deposits\n    \n\n\nApplication fees for 2025For most taught postgraduate programmes starting in 2025 you must pay a non-refundable application fee of £40.

to be worldly: Future-proof yourself\nThe IMPM breaks the mould to create world-class executives who can lead their business in a complex and disruptive global context. Today’s senior managers must be astute negotiators, creative problem solvers, discern business trends, act entrepreneurially, and more. Iconic management thinker Henry Mintzberg founded the programme over 20 years ago to help managers think differently, develop their purpose and act wisely.\n[CARD]\nKey facts\nThe programme is taught by 75 international faculty from five leading global business schools worldwide with five 1½ week mindset modules over 18 months.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBreakthrough perspectives\nAuthentically international, this advanced management programme is designed around management mindsets and business challenges. You will gain breakthrough perspectives and develop enriched capabilities to engage with the uncertainty and dynamism that accompanies senior management positions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipants from various sectors\nOur participants come from a range of sectors such as engineering, finance, manufacturing, media, telecoms and transport. The IMPM programme is designed to encourage sharing experiences and insights with peers so our participants are typically 35-55 years of age. After graduation, you can continue to learn and develop your professional network by returning to the program as an alumni participant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLarge alumni network\nThe true value of the IMPM programme is best described by members of our extensive alumni network of over 500 members who, since completing the programme, have applied their knowledge within their own organisations and discovered a new perspective on their approaches to life and work.\n[CARD]\nBreakthrough perspectives\nAuthentically international, this advanced management programme is designed around management mindsets and business challenges.

In Rio de Janeiro, at Brazil’s renowned FGV-EBAPE, the focus is on catalytic change and how business and global dynamics interact with management and organisational action. To develop an advanced and incisive perspective on managerial action, there are sessions on change management, processual perspectives on change and continuity, managing hierarchies for action, governance and knowledge for action across businesses and societal contexts.\nVisits to companies and public sector enterprises, a school for youth development and workshops on diversity and gender, refresh and extend the scope for managerial and organisational action. Enriching concepts and understanding of change and continuity, the module also focuses on learning innovative practices of management and organisational action, with advanced action inquiry techniques such as Friendly Consulting and In-Reach for organisational action learning and impact.\n[CARD]\nMajor Paper\nThe major paper is the culmination of the IMPM programme. The major paper allows you to demonstrate the key learning outcomes of the IMPM programme through undertaking a major piece of organisational-based research. It provides you with the opportunity to further utilise the key concepts theories and practices introduced during the IMPM and continue to develop your own critical thinking and reflective skills in relation to existing management theories and frameworks and your own practice.\n[CARD]\nAdditional costs\nThere may be extra costs related to your course for items such as books, stationery, printing, photocopying, binding and general subsistence on trips and visits. Following graduation, you may need to pay a subscription to a professional body for some chosen careers.\nSpecific additional costs for studying at Lancaster are listed below.\nCollege fees\nLancaster is proud to be one of only a handful of UK universities to have a collegiate system. Every student belongs to a college, and all students pay a small College Membership Fee which supports the running of college events and activities. Students on some distance-learning courses are not liable to pay a college fee. \nFor students starting in 2025, the fee is £40 for undergraduates and research students and £15 for students on one-year courses.\nComputer equipment and internet access\nTo support your studies, you will also require access to a computer, along with reliable internet access. You will be able to access a range of software and services from a Windows, Mac, Chromebook or Linux device. For certain degree programmes, you may need a specific device, or we may provide you with a laptop and appropriate software - details of which will be available on relevant programme pages. A dedicated IT support helpdesk is available in the event of any problems.\nThe University provides limited financial support to assist students who do not have the required IT equipment or broadband support in place.\n[CARD]\nWhy choose the IMPM?\nIMPM graduate Damiano explains his motivation for choosing the International Masters Program for Managers, and what he enjoyed most about his studies.\n[CARD]\nHolger Beck\nMSc International Management (IMPM), 2020\n[CARD]\nKeiji Horike\nMSc International Management (IMPM), 2020\n[CARD]\nSalima Mohammed\nMSc International Management (IMPM), 2020\n[CARD]\nAna Cristina Rodrigues da Costa\nMSc International Management (IMPM), 2019\n[CARD]\nEmmanuel Harrison\nMSc International Management (IMPM), 2019\n[CARD]\nShaun Mellors\nInternational Masters Program for Managers (IMPM), 2017\n[CARD]\nJulie Dumaine\nMSc International Executive Management (IMPM), 2017\n[CARD]\nSoe Naing \nMSc International Executive Management (IMPM), 2017",
