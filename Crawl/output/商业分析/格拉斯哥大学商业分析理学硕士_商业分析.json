Organization as a patient administrator at the limb reconstruction centre, as part of the trauma and emergency team and was tragically killed in Gaza in November 2023.  The Scholarship is open to a Palestinian National who is living in or has been forced to leave the State of Palestine due to humanitarian reasons. The chosen applicant may be domiciled in any country but must be a Palestinian National.  The scholarship is open to prospective undergraduate and postgraduate taught applicants to the University of Glasgow applying for entry in September 2025/26.\nUniversity of Glasgow is committed to support as many self-funded students as possible which is why UofG discounts and scholarships cannot be combined with one another or any external sponsorship discounts (with the exception of Alumni Discount).\nIf you are offered more than 1 scholarship, the lower value award will be deleted from your account.\nIf you are unsure of whether you are eligible to apply, please

Gaza in November 2023.  The Scholarship is open to a Palestinian National who is living in or has been forced to leave the State of Palestine due to humanitarian reasons. The chosen applicant may be domiciled in any country but must be a Palestinian National.  The scholarship is open to prospective undergraduate and postgraduate taught applicants to the University of Glasgow applying for entry in September 2025/26.\n\nHold a firm conditional or unconditional offer for full time study at the University of Glasgow for 2025/26\n\n\nBe a Palestinian national  \n\nUniversity of Glasgow is committed

All data is anonymised.\nPrivacy policy\nThe University has worked in partnership with the British Council in a scheme to provide Higher Education Scholarships for Palestinians (HESPAL), for the past decade.\nThrough the HESPAL scheme, we have been able to offer fee waivers to students from the Palestinian Territories, enhancing educational opportunities for deserving individuals.\nConsidering the current challenges and the significant obstacles faced by individuals impacted by the conflict in leaving the area, the University of Glasgow extends their support in the academic year 2025/2026 to offer up to 3 postgraduate taught scholarships and up to 2 postgraduate research scholarships.\nThis scholarship is offered as a full fee discount.\nFor more information on eligibility and application process, please visit: Higher Education Scholarships for Palestinians (HESPAL) | British Council\nUniversity of Glasgow is committed to support as many self-funded students as possible which is why UofG discounts and scholarships cannot be combined with one another or any external sponsorship discounts (with the exception of Alumni Discount).\nIf you are offered more than 1 scholarship, the lower value award will be deleted from your account.\nIf you are unsure of whether you are eligible to apply, please contact scholarships@glasgow.ac.uk\nNumber of Scholarships Up to 3 PGT and up to 2

University has worked in partnership with the British Council in a scheme to provide Higher Education Scholarships for Palestinians (HESPAL), for the past decade.\nThrough the HESPAL scheme, we have been able to offer fee waivers to students from the Palestinian Territories, enhancing educational opportunities for deserving individuals.\nConsidering the current challenges and the significant obstacles faced by individuals impacted by the conflict in leaving the area, the University of Glasgow extends their support in the academic year 2025/2026 to offer up to 3 postgraduate taught scholarships and up to 2 postgraduate research scholarships.\nThis scholarship is offered as a full fee discount.\nFor more information on eligibility and application process, please visit: Higher Education Scholarships for Palestinians (HESPAL) | British Council\n \nUniversity of Glasgow is committed to support as many self-funded students as possible which is why UofG discounts and scholarships cannot be combined with one another or any external sponsorship discounts (with the exception of Alumni Discount).\nIf you are offered more than 1 scholarship, the lower value award will be deleted from your account.\nIf you are unsure of whether you are eligible to apply, please contact scholarships@glasgow.ac.uk\n \nNumber of Scholarships Up to 3 PGT and up to 2 PhD\n\n\nEligible
