Teaching methods are designed to build a strong foundation in relevant theories while encouraging their practical application to real-world business analysis.\nThe consultancy project, eligible to those with an average grade of 65 or above from Semester 1, offers a valuable opportunity to apply your classroom learning to real business challenges. This unique, hands-on experience allows you to test, refine, and expand your knowledge and skills while building professional networks.\nRunning for up to three months over the summer, projects may involve supporting a start-up, identifying growth opportunities for a medium-sized firm, or enhancing operations within a large, blue-chip company. Opportunities span a wide range of sectors and industries, both in the North West and internationally, and include everything from SMEs to global corporations.\nYou will also benefit from the dedicated preparation and application support from the School's Careers Service.\nAssessment varies depending on the modules chosen. It may include a combination of coursework, group project assessment, presentations, assignments, report, individual essay and examinations.\nDuring the course you will take 180 credits in total.\nCompulsory units focus on key challenges in strategic management, multinational enterprise operations, comparative business analysis, and essential research skills. Optional courses let you tailor your studies by specialising in specific areas of strategic management and business analysis.\nThe dissertation project has two pathways.\nAcademic dissertation is a piece of original scholarship work written under the direction of a supervisor. Under the mentorship of leading experts, students will dive deep into a topic of their choice, applying rigorous methodologies to uncover fresh insights and advance their field. This unit is designed to sharpen their analytical, critical thinking, and independent research skills – while building a portfolio that sets them apart in both academic and professional arenas.\nDuring the summer period, you will have the opportunity to apply the knowledge and skills learnt during the first two semesters, enhance your skills while working with a major real-life client and work as part of a team. The result of this project is presented as a research report/dissertation. This part of the course is closely related to the Manchester Method that enables you to experience experiential learning and helps you to become a reflective practitioner or manager.\nExamples of recent projects include:\nThe course unit details given below are subject to change, and are the latest example of the curriculum available on this course of study.\nRead about available         scholarships and funding\n.\n• View tabs\n• View full page\n• Expose students to cutting-edge thinking in organisational design, as well as the development and management of strategic capabilities across diverse industries and global contexts.\n• Equip students with the knowledge, skills, and mindset to conduct interdisciplinary research—both theoretical and applied—on business organisations across diverse industries and global contexts.\n• Develop students’ ability to apply advanced research techniques to address management issues related to strategic capability development and management.\n• Enhance students’ ability to collaborate with senior managers and tackle real business challenges as internal or external consultants through supervised consultancy projects.\n• Offer optional modules that equip students with skills tailored to their career goals.\n• 8x taught units = 120 credits\n• Dissertation project = 60 credits\n• Traditional academic dissertations (maximum 8,000 words)\n• Consultancy projects (a group project report maximum 10,000 words; and an individual professional reflective report maximum 2,000 words)\n• Exploring the strategic expansion of the volunteer tourism industry into the academic market\n• An in-depth analysis of the wholesale market and changing trends towards online shopping\n• Strategic positioning in relation to the offshore wind turbine market in northern Europe\n• Identification of venture capitalist acquisition targets in the UK software industry\n• Alliance MBS Masters Scholarships for UK/EU/International students\n[HTML_TABLE]\nTitle | Code | Credit rating | Mandatory/optional\nAnalysing Companies | BMAN72201 | 15 | Mandatory\nOrganisational Design & Strategy: International Contexts | BMAN72231 | 15 | Mandatory\nComparative and Global Management | BMAN72631 | 15 | Mandatory\nBusiness Models: Theory and Practice | BMAN72801 | 15 | Mandatory\nProfessional Analytical Skills | BMAN73652 | 15 | Mandatory\nInternational Human Resource Management | BMAN60992 | 15 | Optional\nThe Political Economy of Global Business | BMAN62012 | 15 | Optional\nInternational Business Finance | BMAN71552 | 15 | Optional\nInnovation Management & Business Strategy | BMAN71942 | 15 | Optional\nInstitutions and Firms Internationalization Strategies | BMAN73172 | 15 | Optional\nResponsible Business in a Global Environment | BMAN73432 | 15 | Optional\nConfiguration of Companies for Capability Building | BMAN73642 | 15 | Optional\nManaging Organisations for Growth | BMAN73662 | 15 | Optional\nOrg Design & Value Creation | BMAN73932 | 15 | Optional\nMSc BASM Consultancy Project | BMAN75530 | 60 | Optional\nDisplaying 10 of 15 course units\nDisplay all course units\n[GRID_TABLE]\nAttend an open day\nDownload our course brochure\nDiscover more about the course",
