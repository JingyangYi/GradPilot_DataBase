In the digital economy with the proliferation of data, businesses have understood the tactical and strategic importance of analytics - the learning from data - as a critical field to detect and monitor client behaviours and expectations, or even future market trends.\nBusiness Analytics tries to answer the following questions: \"What has happened?\" (descriptive analytics), \"Why did it happen?\" (explanatory or diagnostic analytics), \"What will happen?\" (predictive analytics) and \"What should be done?\" (prescriptive analytics). As such, Business Analytics is about bringing the business questions to the data.\nInvesting in Business Analytics can lead to a substantial competitive advantage, which, in certain sectors, ensures prosperity or even survival. Analytics is also one of the most promising approaches for public authorities who, in terms of transport, energy or public health, are required to manage and leverage the explosion of data to generate greater value for both businesses and society.\nGiven the increasing importance of \"big data\" in the economy, GSEM offers a master program in Business Analytics that provides a wide range of career opportunities. This program responds to the growing need of medium to large organisations to leverage the use of data and to transform data assets into better management decisions.\nOBJECTIVES:\nOBJECTIVES:\n2 years (4 semesters)\n2 years (4 semesters)\nwww.unige.ch/conditions/MA\nAs for the Master in Business Analytics, the Scientific Committee may ask the candidates to complete a maximum 6 credits co-required Bachelor course (Business Analytics) during their 1st semester at the Master program.\nDeadline: 28 February 2025\nBusiness (Internship, specialised classes and intership report)\r\nResearch (Elective courses and master thesis)\nThe Mobility is only allowed from the third semester, for one semester maximum, for the \"Research\" orientation only, after having validated the 1st year core courses (63 credits).

In the digital economy with the proliferation of data, businesses have understood the tactical and strategic importance of analytics - the learning from data - as a critical field to detect and monitor client behaviours and expectations, or even future market trends.\nBusiness Analytics tries to answer the following questions: \"What has happened?\" (descriptive analytics), \"Why did it happen?\" (explanatory or diagnostic analytics), \"What will happen?\" (predictive analytics) and \"What should be done?\" (prescriptive analytics). As such, Business Analytics is about bringing the business questions to the data.\nInvesting in Business Analytics can lead to a substantial competitive advantage, which, in certain sectors, ensures prosperity or even survival. Analytics is also one of the most promising approaches for public authorities who, in terms of transport, energy or public health, are required to manage and leverage the explosion of data to generate greater value for both businesses and society.\nGiven the increasing importance of \"big data\" in the economy, GSEM offers a master program in Business Analytics that provides a wide range of career opportunities.

This specialised programme also covers everything that budding interpreters need to know about parliamentary procedure, international organisations, and interpreting theory.\nJust like elite sports players, students train in small groups. They are supported throughout the process by their trainers, conference interpreters themselves, be it in the FTI interpreting rooms, or during inactive booth and observation visits to international organisations or supranational institutions. The department’s cutting-edge communication technologies and top-of-the-range equipment perfectly prepare our future interpreters for the demands of the profession.\nStudents choose from a range of languages, selected with the requirements of the profession in mind.\nWith this tailored programme, students benefit from the first-hand knowledge of experienced interpreters to ensure that successful graduates enter the market with their best foot forward.\n1.5 years (3 semesters)\nFrench, English and the languages in the student's chosen combination.\nwww.unige.ch/conditions/MA\nA Bachelor in Multilingual Communication from the FTI or another university in the same branch of study, bachelor or another degree deemed to be equivalent in other branch of study. In addition, students must pass an entrance exam and have an excellent command of the languages in their chosen combination.\nSuccessful admission exam (distance examination).\nDeadline: 5 October 2024\nApplicants must choose 2, 3 or 4 languages for their combination, based on the languages offered at the FTI: German, Arabic, Spanish, French, Italian, English, Portuguese and Russian. Your language combination must include your mother tongue or language of education, as well as one active language, or two or three other languages, which can be active or passive. Language combinaison should be designated as active or passive based on your proficiency in each language and must include English.\nThe training received at FTI opens up a number of opportunities in both the public and private sectors. Upon the completion of their studies, students of the interpreting stream may find work in-house or as freelance interpreters in a large number of areas and professions, such as international organisations, NGOs, publishing, translation agencies, administration, documentation centres, research institutes, banking, insurance, courts, the media and teaching, etc.\nInterpreters are often required to travel.\nMasters\r\nMs Nicole Stoll\r\nT. +41 (0)22 379 87 07\n[javascript protected email address]\noffer high-level professional training. At the end of their degree, students will be able to translate texts and specialised documents into their native language, or language of education. Our programmes help them develop the necessary skills (textual, thematic, strategic, sociolinguistic and technical) to apply the right translation strategies in every context. Throughout their studies, students will further develop their analysis and research skills, as well as reflect on the act of translation. Students can choose from three different concentrations: specialised translation, translation and technologies and specialised multilingual communication.\nTHE MASTER IN SPECIALISED TRANSLATION \r\nprovides training in legal and economic/financial translation. Some of our language units also offer courses in scientific/technical and literary translation. Students also have the option of specialising further, with concentrations available in \"legal and institutional translation\", \"economic and financial translation\" and \"translation studies\".  Students must participate in a seminar to help develop their professional skills, in addition to finding an internship during their studies (this does not apply to students specialising in translation studies, which paves the way for an academic career).\nStudents who elect to do THE MASTER IN TRANSLATION AND TECHNOLOGIES will emerge as versatile translators who are skilled in multilingual engineering and the latest translation technology. This programme is based on three major topics: translation software tools, terminology, and localisation and project management. Courses are varied and geared towards both professional and research purposes. Students may also further specialise, with concentrations available in \"Terminology\", and \"Localisation and Machine Translation\".\nTHE MASTER IN TRANSLATION AND SPECIALISED MULTILINGUAL COMMUNICATION\r\nenables future translators to develop their analytical, linguistic, intercultural and teamwork skills to carry out specialised multilingual communication projects. It combines training in translation with corporate communication (multilingual finance and marketing), multimedia communication (web, localisation and audiovisual translation) and language management (language policy and diversity management).\n1 passive language: 1.5 years (3 semesters)\n2 or 3 passive languages: 2 years (4 semesters)\n1 passive language: 1.5 years (3 semesters)\n2 or 3 passive languages: 2 years (4 semesters)\nCourses are taught in your A language.

Your B languages are your passive languages. The languages offered at the FTI are German, English, Arabic, Spanish, French, Italian and Russian (only as a B language). Applicants must select 1, 2 or 3 passive languages for the MA in Specialised Translation and the MA in Translation and Specialised Multilingual Communication. For the MA in Specialised Communication with a concentration in \"legal and institutional translation\", \"economic and financial translation\" or \"translation studies\", as well as the MA in Translation and Technologies, students are limited to a maximum of 2 passive languages.\nwww.unige.ch/exchange\nOur Master's programmes prepare students for careers in both the public and private sectors. After their degree, they have the possibility of finding in-house positions or setting up a freelance career.

At the end of their degree, students will be able to translate texts and specialised documents into their native language, or language of education. Our programmes help them develop the necessary skills (textual, thematic, strategic, sociolinguistic and technical) to apply the right translation strategies in every context. Throughout their studies, students will further develop their analysis and research skills, as well as reflect on the act of translation. Students can choose from three different concentrations: specialised translation, translation and technologies and specialised multilingual communication.\nTHE MASTER IN SPECIALISED TRANSLATION \r\nprovides training in legal and economic/financial translation. Some of our language units also offer courses in scientific/technical and literary translation. Students also have the option of specialising further, with concentrations available in \"legal and institutional translation\", \"economic and financial translation\" and \"translation studies\".  Students must participate in a seminar to help develop their professional skills, in addition to finding an internship during their studies (this does not apply to students specialising in translation studies, which paves the way for an academic career).\nStudents who elect to do THE MASTER IN TRANSLATION AND TECHNOLOGIES will emerge as versatile translators who are skilled in multilingual engineering and the latest translation technology. This programme is based on three major topics: translation software tools, terminology, and localisation and project management. Courses are varied and geared towards both professional and research purposes. Students may also further specialise, with concentrations available in \"Terminology\", and \"Localisation and Machine Translation\".\nTHE MASTER IN TRANSLATION AND SPECIALISED MULTILINGUAL COMMUNICATION\r\nenables future translators to develop their analytical, linguistic, intercultural and teamwork skills to carry out specialised multilingual communication projects. It combines training in translation with corporate communication (multilingual finance and marketing), multimedia communication (web, localisation and audiovisual translation) and language management (language policy and diversity management).\nSpecialised Translation\nThe three Masters in\nSpecialised Translation\n\n\noffer high-level professional training.

It is a truly cross-disciplinary programme, with students choosing between two specialisations: «European economics, politics, institutions and societies» or «Global Europe».\r\nThe programme begins with a number of core cross-disciplinary classes, worth a total of 24 credits, that students in both specialisations must complete. Starting in their first semester, students must also select three methodology classes from around ten that are available in order to obtain 18 research-related credits.\r\nOnce these credits have been obtained, students then focus on their selected specialisation, which they must choose before starting the Master's programme.\nThe specialisation «European Economics, Politics, Institutions and Societies» looks at the European project through classes in subjects such as political science, sociology and economics, focusing on the key role that the law has played in the process of European integration. Students will also delve into European culture, in keeping with the vision of the European Institute's founder, Denis de Rougemont, who considered culture to be an essential component of the European project.\nWith the «Global Europe» specialisation, students will look at Europe's place in the world. This new specialisation offers students the chance to consider the European Union's role in addressing global challenges, its ability to meet those challenges, and its place in international systems as the global balance of power has shifted. The programme covers history, law, political science and economics, and also looks at the defintion of global studies itself.\nStudents must also take 30 credits in elective classes. This enables them to deepen their knowledge in a number of topics selected from among the array of classes offered by both the GSI and our partner faculties (law, economics and management, humanities, social sciences, etc.).\nIn addition, students have the option of spending a semester at one of our partner universities.\nLastly, to complete the Master's programme, all students must either carry out an internship or write a research thesis. As part of the internship, which prepares students for the working world, students must write a report summarising their experience. The research thesis gives students the opportunity to work on a specific research question that may or may not be cross-disciplinary.

New states have appeared on the map and asserted their sovereignty following the collapse of the Russian, German, Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires in 1917-1918, followed by the dismantling of the Soviet empire in the early 1990s. Heirs to several decades of shared history, they are each asserting their own political, economic and cultural identity. Between a shared history and divided memories and projects, their present trajectories form painful areas of tension and conflict that can lead to war or the establishment of economic, political and military alliances.\nThe Master's degree in Central and Eastern Europe, Central Asia and Caucasus (MAEAC) provides the tools for understanding and tackling the contemporary issues associated with this complex area, formerly known as the 'Eastern bloc' or 'Soviet bloc'.\r\nThis master's program is not disciplinary: while contemporary history and Slavic studies play an important role in the teaching, geopolitics, political science and economics are also used in various ways in the teaching program.\r\nThe program is divided into three phases. Students begin their course with the compulsory core curriculum and then, from the second semester, choose courses within the various specializations. Students can also spend a semester abroad, thanks to the many agreements offered. The degree is awarded on completion of a dissertation, which prepares students for research careers, or an internship, which prepares students for professional careers.\n2 years (4 semesters)\nwww.unige.ch/conditions/MA\nunige.ch/gsi/fr/programmes/marem\nDeadline: 28 February 2025\nwww.unige.ch/enrolment\nMaster's students are permitted to go on exchange for one semester maximum, as early as their third semester of study, and may earn no more than 30 credits at another university.

It offers an open and multidisciplinary approach to the study of the politics, history, and culture of the region.\r\nThe Master in Middle Eastern Studies (MAMO) allows students to deepen and enrich their knowledge of a strategic, promising and vulnerable region, one which is constantly propelled to the forefront of the world stage, where the ever-increasing interconnection between the various actors (states, civil societies, non-state groups, etc.) has a considerable impact on local and regional dynamics. This Master provides the opportunity to study, among other things, social mobilization, the evolution of relations between Arab countries and Israel or Iran, the development of cultural diplomacy in the Gulf and elsewhere, oil revenues or the impact of global crises, such as COVID-19, on the region. The multidisciplinary approach - be it historical, cultural, geopolitical or other - allows students to grasp the various phenomena in their entirety and provides them with the tools to develop their own analytical skills while broadening their knowledge of the region and its people.\r\nThese themes will first be introduced as part of the core curriculum; specialized courses, as well as elective courses (at the University of Geneva, the Graduate Institute, and the Universities of Lausanne and Neuchâtel), will allow each student to acquire an in-depth knowledge of the region, while choosing the themes of the courses according to his/her interests. Exchange semesters at universities in the region studied or internships in Geneva and the Middle East will further strengthen the students' skills.

The MScGH mission is to provide students the toolbox to understand and analyse health issues whose determinants are interlinked and whose complexity transcends borders and sectors of activity.\r\nIn our interdependent world, significant health issues such as emerging and remerging infectious diseases, the rise of chronic conditions, and the impact of climate change on health are intersectoral and transnational challenges which require collaboration and cooperation among multiple actors. To respond to these challenges, new educational opportunities are needed in addition to traditional training programmes in medicine or public health.\r\nThe MScGH seeks to combine the most relevant approaches on global health drawing on the perspectives of all relevant academic disciplines and global health actors based in Geneva. The MScGH is specifically designed to take advantage of the rich international environment of Geneva.

Whether it is in the economic, social, environmental demographic or political sphere, African societies are evolving fast. This Master's programme provides the critical distance needed to understand these transformations in all their complexity. The curriculum stands out for its interdisciplinarity, combining approaches from the social, natural and human sciences. It also provides a long-term perspective and gives students the opportunity to study Africa not in isolation, but in terms of the continent's interactions with the rest of the world.\nThe Master's programme begins with a number of core cross-disciplinary classes. After the first semester, students take more specialised courses and electives. They can choose from a broad range of classes covering topics such as environmental issues, state formation and the development of societies.\nGeneva, which houses many international organisations, is a unique place to study these dynamics. This Master's programme also places particular emphasis on experience in the field, and students can take advantage of exchanges with UNIGE's partner universities in Africa. To complete their course, students choose between a «research» option, which includes a fieldwork and a thesis, and a «professionalising» option involving a work placement/internship over several months and a detailed internship report.\n2 years (4 semesters)\nFrenchKnowledge of English is recommended.\nwww.unige.ch/conditions/MA\nBachelor’s degree or equivalent degree.\nMerit-based admission.\nunige.ch/gsi/fr/programmes/mafr\nDeadline: 28 February 2025\nwww.unige.ch/enrolment\nwww.unige.ch/exchange\nAfrica is a new hub of economic and demographic growth. As its role in the international stage becomes more and more pronounced, so do the social inequalities generated by this growth. Graduates of the programme have the skills needed to understand and address the issues at stake in Africa, and they find work in a variety of sectors such as diplomacy, international organisations and NGOs, the media, industry, including multinationals operating in Africa, or in the promotion and protection of historical and cultural heritage.\nof the University of Geneva is a two-year full-time programme which focuses on identifying, understanding, and solving global challenges. It aims to train a new generation of professionals to approach today's most pressing challenges from an interdisciplinary perspective. Students will notably learn to draw upon knowledge and evidence from different sources as well as collaborate across levels and sectors.\n\r\nThe present era of globalization has ushered in a complexification of international relations, thereby requiring alternative modalities for thinking about the world. Humanity has achieved an unprecedented state of development but, with a population of 8.1 billion and a fast-growing demand for natural resources coupled with environmental degradation, it is facing unparalleled sustainability challenges. The scale and magnitude of global challenges require broad transformations in the organization of societies, economies, and politics. These transformations cannot happen, however, without a concomitant transformation of our knowledge system. This means reducing knowledge gaps within the social sciences as well as between the natural sciences and social sciences to foster 'global system science'. In contrast to siloed disciplinary knowledges, a global system science is more suited for understanding the nature of interconnectivity today and its implications for humanity and the planet. Such a holistic approach is further enabled through the advancement of computing power technologies and big data.\nIn the Master of Global Studies (MAGS), students will gain a comprehensive understanding of contemporary global challenges and how to respond to them, including through the innovation of governance designs. Examples of course topics covered include: 1) international relations, geopolitics, global and regional governance, and diplomacy; 2) interdisciplinarity, collaborative problem solving, and critical theory; 3) systems thinking, complexity science, and data science. The MAGS is highly flexible in terms of curriculum requirements, allowing students to follow their individual interests and chart their own educational path. The MAGS also provides students with opportunities to engage with the international environment in Geneva, notably through the 'Geneva Multilateral Clinic' offered in the fourth semester in close cooperation with International Geneva actors.\n2 years (4 semesters)\nEnglishCourses are taught in English.

Students will also delve into European culture, in keeping with the vision of the European Institute's founder, Denis de Rougemont, who considered culture to be an essential component of the European project.\nWith the «Global Europe» specialisation, students will look at Europe's place in the world. This new specialisation offers students the chance to consider the European Union's role in addressing global challenges, its ability to meet those challenges, and its place in international systems as the global balance of power has shifted. The programme covers history, law, political science and economics, and also looks at the defintion of global studies itself.\nStudents must also take 30 credits in elective classes.

As part of the internship, which prepares students for the working world, students must write a report summarising their experience. The research thesis gives students the opportunity to work on a specific research question that may or may not be cross-disciplinary. It prepares students for further academic research and, potentially, a PhD.\nEuropean Studies\nThe Master in\nEuropean Studies\n\n\nhas been successfully training students from around the world since 1963.

Between a shared history and divided memories and projects, their present trajectories form painful areas of tension and conflict that can lead to war or the establishment of economic, political and military alliances.\nThe Master's degree in Central and Eastern Europe, Central Asia and Caucasus (MAEAC) provides the tools for understanding and tackling the contemporary issues associated with this complex area, formerly known as the 'Eastern bloc' or 'Soviet bloc'.\r\nThis master's program is not disciplinary: while contemporary history and Slavic studies play an important role in the teaching, geopolitics, political science and economics are also used in various ways in the teaching program.\r\nThe program is divided into three phases. Students begin their course with the compulsory core curriculum and then, from the second semester, choose courses within the various specializations.

It offers an open and multidisciplinary approach to the study of the politics, history, and culture of the region.\r\nThe Master in Middle Eastern Studies (MAMO) allows students to deepen and enrich their knowledge of a strategic, promising and vulnerable region, one which is constantly propelled to the forefront of the world stage, where the ever-increasing interconnection between the various actors (states, civil societies, non-state groups, etc.) has a considerable impact on local and regional dynamics. This Master provides the opportunity to study, among other things, social mobilization, the evolution of relations between Arab countries and Israel or Iran, the development of cultural diplomacy in the Gulf and elsewhere, oil revenues or the impact of global crises, such as COVID-19, on the region. The multidisciplinary approach - be it historical, cultural, geopolitical or other - allows students to grasp the various phenomena in their entirety and provides them with the tools to develop their own analytical skills while broadening their knowledge of the region and its people.\r\nThese themes will first be introduced as part of the core curriculum; specialized courses, as well as elective courses (at the University of Geneva, the Graduate Institute, and the Universities of Lausanne and Neuchâtel), will allow each student to acquire an in-depth knowledge of the region, while choosing the themes of the courses according to his/her interests. Exchange semesters at universities in the region studied or internships in Geneva and the Middle East will further strengthen the students' skills. Those who wish to do so can also familiarize themselves with Arabic and Armenian during their basic training and improve their knowledge during a stay in the region.\nMiddle Eastern Studies\nThe Master in\nMiddle Eastern Studies\n\n\nThis program is aimed at students wishing to specialize in Middle East issues.

This Master's programme also places particular emphasis on experience in the field, and students can take advantage of exchanges with UNIGE's partner universities in Africa. To complete their course, students choose between a «research» option, which includes a fieldwork and a thesis, and a «professionalising» option involving a work placement/internship over several months and a detailed internship report.\nAfrican Studies\nThe Master in\nAfrican Studies\n\n\nAfrica is experiencing radical changes.

Graduates of the programme have the skills needed to understand and address the issues at stake in Africa, and they find work in a variety of sectors such as diplomacy, international organisations and NGOs, the media, industry, including multinationals operating in Africa, or in the promotion and protection of historical and cultural heritage.\nProfessional Prospects\nContact information\n\nMs Maud Preher\r\nT. +41 (0)22 379 37 11\n[javascript protected email address]\nContact information\n\nMs Maud Preher\r\nT. +41 (0)22 379 37 11\n[javascript protected email address]\nContact information\n[GRID_TABLE]\nThe Master in\nGlobal Studies\n\n\nof the University of Geneva is a two-year full-time programme which focuses on identifying, understanding, and solving global challenges. It aims to train a new generation of professionals to approach today's most pressing challenges from an interdisciplinary perspective. Students will notably learn to draw upon knowledge and evidence from different sources as well as collaborate across levels and sectors.\n\r\nThe present era of globalization has ushered in a complexification of international relations, thereby requiring alternative modalities for thinking about the world. Humanity has achieved an unprecedented state of development but, with a population of 8.1 billion and a fast-growing demand for natural resources coupled with environmental degradation, it is facing unparalleled sustainability challenges. The scale and magnitude of global challenges require broad transformations in the organization of societies, economies, and politics. These transformations cannot happen, however, without a concomitant transformation of our knowledge system. This means reducing knowledge gaps within the social sciences as well as between the natural sciences and social sciences to foster 'global system science'. In contrast to siloed disciplinary knowledges, a global system science is more suited for understanding the nature of interconnectivity today and its implications for humanity and the planet. Such a holistic approach is further enabled through the advancement of computing power technologies and big data.\nIn the Master of Global Studies (MAGS), students will gain a comprehensive understanding of contemporary global challenges and how to respond to them, including through the innovation of governance designs. Examples of course topics covered include: 1) international relations, geopolitics, global and regional governance, and diplomacy; 2) interdisciplinarity, collaborative problem solving, and critical theory; 3) systems thinking, complexity science, and data science. The MAGS is highly flexible in terms of curriculum requirements, allowing students to follow their individual interests and chart their own educational path. The MAGS also provides students with opportunities to engage with the international environment in Geneva, notably through the 'Geneva Multilateral Clinic' offered in the fourth semester in close cooperation with International Geneva actors.\nGlobal Studies\nThe Master in\nGlobal Studies\n\n\nof the University of Geneva is a two-year full-time programme which focuses on identifying, understanding, and solving global challenges.

Many institutions and organisations are having to adapt to the new status of the child as a subject of rights. With the knowledge acquired during the MIDE programme, graduates are prepared for diverse professional tracks, and many have found careers in international organisations, NGOs, child protection and child welfare services, universities of teacher education, offices for the advancement of youth, youth counseling services, courts, residential and/or foster care institutions, etc. Some graduates have opted for an academic career by pursuing research activities or a doctorate, while others have returned to their professional functions or previous fields of study with certified, comprehensive knowledge of children's rights.\nProfessional Prospects\nContact information\n\nT. +41 (0)27 205 73 42\n[javascript protected email address]\nContact information\n\nT. +41 (0)27 205 73 42\n[javascript protected email address]\nContact information\n[GRID_TABLE]\nContact information\n\nT. +41 (0)27 205 73 42\n[javascript protected email address]\nContact information\n[GRID_TABLE]\nThe Master in\nInnovation, Human Development and Sustainability (MIHDS)\n\n\nThe MIHDS stems from a partnership between the University of Geneva and organizations from International Geneva in the framework of the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). This highly multidisciplinary Master's degree aims to train students to analyze problems and identify innovative solutions in terms of the governance of sustainability. The curriculum contains a high proportion of practical courses (project workshops), but also fundamental courses on sustainability development in all its dimensions (social, economic, and environmental). This Master's programme was created in partnership with Tsinghua University (Beijing). Students can apply either to the Dual or the Single track. The Dual track links two complementary programs, one in Geneva and the other in Beijing (minimum 1 year each), to earn two diplomas after two and a half years of study. Students of the Single track (UNIGE diploma) are required to do an exchange semester at one of the partner universities (currently Tsinghua, Ashoka, Bogotá, Dakar, Exeter, Los Angeles, Medellín, Pisa, Yonsei).\nTHREE AVAILABLE SPECIALISATION MODULES:\n\nSustainable Human Development\nSustainable consumption, production and organizations\nFuture cities and regions\n unige.ch/sciences-societe/formations/masters-in-english/innovation-human-development-and-sustainability\nInnovation, Human Development and Sustainability (MIHDS)\nThe Master in\nInnovation, Human Development and Sustainability (MIHDS)\n\n\nThe MIHDS stems from a partnership between the University of Geneva and organizations from International Geneva in the framework of the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).

This Master's programme was created in partnership with Tsinghua University (Beijing). Students can apply either to the Dual or the Single track. The Dual track links two complementary programs, one in Geneva and the other in Beijing (minimum 1 year each), to earn two diplomas after two and a half years of study. Students of the Single track (UNIGE diploma) are required to do an exchange semester at one of the partner universities (currently Tsinghua, Ashoka, Bogotá, Dakar, Exeter, Los Angeles, Medellín, Pisa, Yonsei).\nTHREE AVAILABLE SPECIALISATION MODULES:\n\nSustainable Human Development\nSustainable consumption, production and organizations\nFuture cities and regions\n
