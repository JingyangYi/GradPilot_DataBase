The key difference lies in the application domain.\nBusiness Analytics students apply these skills to solve real-world business problems, starting from a business need and using data science principles like statistics, machine learning, and optimization to guide company actions. Our graduates are “Business Data Scientists”.\nIn contrast, a Data Science Master's program emphasizes the mathematical and theoretical underpinnings of these methods, focusing on the modeling mechanics and potential applications across a wide range of domains.\nIf you are interested in applying AI and data science to solve business problems, the Rady Master of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA) program is the right choice for you.\nHarnessing the power of AI is a critical skill for both the current and future workforce. AI technologies like large language models (LLMs) have the potential to drive unprecedented business value and efficiency. Maximizing this potential will require Business Data Scientists that understand the potential and have the technical expertise to extract more value faster. In the Rady MSBA AI-assisted curriculum, we incorporate LLM’s in every facet of the Business Analytics process, from problem definition, to data cleaning, coding, analysis, and presentation. We prepare our students for a future where AI is an integral part of a business data scientist’s job description.\nThe coursework in our MSBA program is designed to create a level of proficiency in data analysis, programming, and the use of AI that is not feasible in a general management education you would receive from an MBA program. If your aim is to develop the ability to leverage AI for sophisticated analytics and data-driven business decision-making, our MSBA program will help you achieve these goals. However, an MSBA does not provide the broader perspective on management and leadership that Rady’s MBA program offers.\nThe MSBA program was developed by Rady faculty specifically to meet the growing need for highly skilled professionals that can solve complex business problems using data, statistics, and machine learning. Our curriculum is designed to teach students how to leverage AI and apply sophisticated analytics to real-world business cases. The program culminates in a Capstone Project in which a team of MSBA students collaborates with a client company to solve a pressing business problem. Students gain not only a robust technical skillset but also the ability to apply AI and the analytical tools they have mastered in practice and create value for both customers and companies.\nWork experience is not required for our MSBA program but is preferred. If you do not have work experience, we will want to know why you believe now is the right time to pursue the MSBA degree and we will look for excellent academic records, relevant internships, and clear career goals.\nBusiness experience or coursework is not required for our MSBA program. However, we do look for applicants with a keen interest in using analytics to drive business decisions.\nWe welcome applications from individuals who have already completed an advanced degree in science, engineering, technology, or other quantitative disciplines. Our program can help you to transfer the skills you have already developed and apply them to address important business problems.\nCoursework in subjects such as calculus, linear algebra, econometrics, and advanced statistics and probability will prepare you for our MSBA program. It is also very important to have (some) experience with programming (e.g., Python, R, SQL, C/C++) and statistical applications (e.g., R, SAS, STATA). Accepted applicants are required to complete the Python and R programming DataCamp.com coursework listed below before the start of the program in August.\nLong-term success in business analytics requires both strong quantitative foundations and an interest in solving business problems. Applicants that are stronger in one area or the other can still very much be successful in admissions. We will also ensure that all students develop the required skills in AI and machine learning to start a promising career in business analytics upon completion of our MSBA program.\nThe STEM designation allows international students who complete the Rady Full-Time MSBA program on an F-1 student visa the opportunity to extend their post-graduation time in the U.S through Optional Practical Training (OPT) and the STEM OPT Extension. OPT is a type of employment authorization for F-1 students and allows the opportunity for Rady Full-Time MSBA graduates to pursue a 12-month period of relevant work experience upon the completion of their degree.  The STEM OPT extension provides an additional 2-year period to gain work experience in the U.S. in their field of study. For more information on OPT and the 24-month STEM OPT Extension, please visit the International Students & Programs Office OPT webpage.\nEligibility RequirementAll students must have conferred their undergraduate degree by the first day of instruction in the program (late July).  Please note that concurrent enrollment is not allowed.\nThe following UCSD undergraduate courses offer relevant preparation for the Rady MSBA program. These courses are not required to apply to or be admitted to the Rady MSBA program. UCSD undergraduates should consult with their undergraduate academic adviser and the UCSD course catalog regarding course availability, enrollment, and applicability to each student’s undergraduate degree requirements.\nThe Rady MSBA program begins during the Summer quarter each year. Students enrolled in a degree program at UCSD prior to the start of the Rady MSBA must complete their degree requirements and course of study by the end of the preceding spring quarter. For example, current UCSD students applying to the Summer 2025 program must finish all degree requirements by the end of Spring 2025 quarter.\nExplore by Program\nFull-Time MBA\nPart-Time MBA (FlexEvening)\nExecutive MBA\nMaster of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA)\nMaster of Professional Accountancy (MPAc)\nMaster of Quantitative Finance (MQF)\nUndergraduate Programs\nExecutive Education\nCurrent Students\nDonors & Investors\nMilitary/Veterans\nCompanies and Recruiters\nContact Admissions\nSchedule a Visit\nUpcoming Events\nRequest Information\nTake a Virtual Tour\nMaps & Directions\nPartner with Rady\n• Search\n\nThis Site\nAll UCSD Sites\nFaculty/Staff\n\n\nSearch Term\n• Why Rady  \n\nBusiness is a Science\nDean’s Office\nRady Stats\nUC San Diego's Business School\n20th Anniversary\nCareer Impact\nStudent Experience\nCenters of Excellence\nOur Partnership With San Diego\nEquity Diversity, and Inclusion\nRady News\n• Business is a Science\n• Dean’s Office\n• Rady Stats\n• UC San Diego's Business School\n• 20th Anniversary\n• Career Impact\n• Student Experience\n• Centers of Excellence\n• Our Partnership With San Diego\n• Equity Diversity, and Inclusion\n• Rady News\n• Programs  \n\nExplore by Program\nFull-Time MBA\n Part-Time MBA (FlexEvening)\nExecutive MBA\nMaster of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA)\nMaster of Quantitative Finance (MQF)\nMaster of Professional Accountancy (MPAc)\nPh.D. Program\nUndergraduate Programs\nExecutive Education\n• Explore by Program\n• Full-Time MBA\n• Part-Time MBA (FlexEvening)\n• Executive MBA\n• Master of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA)\n• Master of Quantitative Finance (MQF)\n• Master of Professional Accountancy (MPAc)\n• Ph.D. Program\n• Undergraduate Programs\n• Executive Education\n• Faculty & Research  \n\nFaculty & Research Overview\nResearch Faculty\nProgram Directors\nOther Faculty\nWhat We Are Working On\nResearch\nResearch Seminars\nFaculty Recruitment\n• Faculty & Research Overview\n• Research Faculty\n• Program Directors\n• Other Faculty\n• What We Are Working On\n• Research\n• Research Seminars\n• Faculty Recruitment\n• Partner With Rady  \n\nWorkforce Development\nRecruit Rady Talent\nCapstone Projects\nCustom Executive Education\n• Workforce Development\n• Recruit Rady Talent\n• Capstone Projects\n• Custom Executive Education\n• Connect  \n\nConnect with us\nUpcoming Events\nRequest Information\nVenue Rental\nVisit Rady\nTake a Virtual Tour\nApply Now\n• Connect with us\n• Upcoming Events\n• Request Information\n• Venue Rental\n• Visit Rady\n• Take a Virtual Tour\n• Apply Now\n• Info For  \n\nIncoming Rady Students\nCurrent Students\nStaff\nDonors\nMilitary\nPress\nOther\n• Incoming Rady Students\n• Current Students\n• Staff\n• Donors\n• Military\n• Press\n• Other\n• Alumni  \n\nAlumni Reunion Weekend 2025\nRady Alumni\nJoin the Rady Network\nCareer Development\nGet Involved\nOur Board\n• Alumni Reunion Weekend 2025\n• Rady Alumni\n• Join the Rady Network\n• Career Development\n• Get Involved\n• Our Board\n• Business is a Science\n• Dean’s Office\n• Rady Stats\n• UC San Diego's Business School\n• 20th Anniversary\n• Career Impact\n• Student Experience\n• Centers of Excellence\n• Our Partnership With San Diego\n• Equity Diversity, and Inclusion\n• Rady News\n• Explore by Program\n• Full-Time MBA\n• Part-Time MBA (FlexEvening)\n• Executive MBA\n• Master of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA)\n• Master of Quantitative Finance (MQF)\n• Master of Professional Accountancy (MPAc)\n• Ph.D. Program\n• Undergraduate Programs\n• Executive Education\n• Faculty & Research Overview\n• Research Faculty\n• Program Directors\n• Other Faculty\n• What We Are Working On\n• Research\n• Research Seminars\n• Faculty Recruitment\n• Workforce Development\n• Recruit Rady Talent\n• Capstone Projects\n• Custom Executive Education\n• Connect with us\n• Upcoming Events\n• Request Information\n• Venue Rental\n• Visit Rady\n• Take a Virtual Tour\n• Apply Now\n• Incoming Rady Students\n• Current Students\n• Staff\n• Donors\n• Military\n• Press\n• Other\n• Alumni Reunion Weekend 2025\n• Rady Alumni\n• Join the Rady Network\n• Career Development\n• Get Involved\n• Our Board\n• HOME\n• Programs\n• Master of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA)\n• MSBA Program FAQs\n• Introduction to ChatGPT\n• Introduction to Python\n• Pandas Foundations\n• Intermediate Python for Data Science\n• Introduction to R\n• Intermediate R\n• Intermediate R: Practice\n• Reading Data into R with readr\n• Introduction to Shell for Data Science: Manipulating files and directories\n• MGT 3.

The key difference lies in the application domain. \nBusiness Analytics students apply these skills to solve real-world business problems, starting from a business need and using data science principles like statistics, machine learning, and optimization to guide company actions. Our graduates are “Business Data Scientists”.\nIn contrast, a Data Science Master's program emphasizes the mathematical and theoretical underpinnings of these methods, focusing on the modeling mechanics and potential applications across a wide range of domains. \nIf you are interested in applying AI and data science to solve business problems, the Rady Master of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA) program is the right choice for you.\n\n\nWhat does AI-Assisted mean?\n\n\nHarnessing the power of AI is a critical skill for both the current and future workforce. AI technologies like large language models (LLMs) have the potential to drive unprecedented business value and efficiency. Maximizing this potential will require Business Data Scientists that understand the potential and have the technical expertise to extract more value faster. In the Rady MSBA AI-assisted curriculum, we incorporate LLM’s in every facet of the Business Analytics process, from problem definition, to data cleaning, coding, analysis, and presentation. We prepare our students for a future where AI is an integral part of a business data scientist’s job description.\n\n\nHow is the Master of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA) program different from an MBA?\n\n\nThe coursework in our MSBA program is designed to create a level of proficiency in data analysis, programming, and the use of AI that is not feasible in a general management education you would receive from an MBA program. If your aim is to develop the ability to leverage AI for sophisticated analytics and data-driven business decision-making, our MSBA program will help you achieve these goals. However, an MSBA does not provide the broader perspective on management and leadership that Rady’s MBA program offers.\n\n\nHow does Rady’s MSBA program differ from other MSBA programs?\n\n\nThe MSBA program was developed by Rady faculty specifically to meet the growing need for highly skilled professionals that can solve complex business problems using data, statistics, and machine learning. Our curriculum is designed to teach students how to leverage AI and apply sophisticated analytics to real-world business cases. The program culminates in a Capstone Project in which a team of MSBA students collaborates with a client company to solve a pressing business problem. Students gain not only a robust technical skillset but also the ability to apply AI and the analytical tools they have mastered in practice and create value for both customers and companies.\n\n\nWhat are the days and hours of the MSBA program?\n\n\n            For our Full-Time program, classes can be scheduled on Monday-Thursday between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. A course load of 12–14 units would translate into approximately 9–11 hours of classes each week.\n        \n\nIs it possible to complete a dual MSBA & MBA at Rady?\n\n\n            Rady does not currently offer dual-degree programs.\n        \n\nAre there opportunities to take classes in other departments at UC San Diego?\n\n\n            Students demonstrating academic success within the Rady MSBA program may petition to enroll in classes in other departments at UC San Diego, e.g., Computer Science, depending on departmental permission and availability.\n        \n\nCan I start the program in the winter/spring?\n\n\n            Rady's MSBA program is offered as a summer (August) start only.\n        \n\nCan I transfer credit from another graduate program?\n\n\n            The Rady MSBA program does not accept transfer credit from other graduate programs.\n        \n\nDoes the Full-Time MSBA program accept 3-year degrees?\n\n\nThe FT MSBA program accepts applicants with a 3-year undergraduate degree.  Equivalency to a 4-year degree will be evaluated by the UC San Diego Graduate Division Admissions team if nominated for admission to the program.\n\n\nDo you offer a pre-application review for eligibility? \n\n\nThe Full-Time MSBA program does not offer pre-application review for eligibility.  If the program aligns your professional and academic goals, we encourage you to submit a complete application for admissions consideration. Prospective applicants can review the FT MSBA Admission Requirements and the Full-Time MSBA Cohort Profile to determine fit to the program.\n\n\n Can I apply for a Teaching Assistant (TA) or Graduate Assistant (GA) position during the program?\n\n\nThe Rady School of Management offers a limited number of TA positions each quarter.  Available TA positions and the application process is shared with current Rady graduate students after the start of the program. Please visit the Rady TA website for more information.\n\n\nCan I apply to multiple programs at the Rady School of Management at the same time?\n\n\nUC San Diego and the Rady School of Management permit only one submitted application at a time to any Rady School graduate degree programs.  If you’re unsure which program best aligns with your background and career goals, our admissions team is available to help you.  If you have started, submitted, or received an admissions decision from one program but decide to apply to another, please reach out to the admissions team for guidance.  If multiple applications are submitted at the same time, neither application will be reviewed until a first-choice preference is made by the applicant.\n\nPlease note that the application fee is nonrefundable. In cases where multiple applications are submitted, any fee paid for an application that is not reviewed will not be refunded.\n\n\nCan the application fee be waived?\n\n\nThe Rady School of Management does not offer application fee waivers upon request. Application fee waivers are made available to prospective applicants at select in-person and virtual recruitment events. Prospective students are advised to attend those admission events that are of interest to them.  Should it be pre-approved for an application fee waiver, attendees will be notified during the event.\n\nThe Rady School of Management is proud to offer pre-approval of application fee waivers to select populations, including active-duty and veteran members of the military; applicants affiliated with the Peace Corps, Teach for American, or AmeriCorps; SIEML and CaLI alumni; and MPAc Junior Applicants with approved Conditional Nomination.  Qualifying applicants should inform the Rady Graduate Admissions at RadyGradAdmissions@ucsd.edu prior to submitting their application for assistance with the fee waiver.\n\nApplication fees paid before an application fee waiver has been approved and/or applied will not be refunded.\n\n\n\n\nProgram Eligibility\n\n\n\nIs work experience required for admission to Rady’s MSBA program?\n\n\nWork experience is not required for our MSBA program but is preferred. If you do not have work experience, we will want to know why you believe now is the right time to pursue the MSBA degree and we will look for excellent academic records, relevant internships, and clear career goals.\n\n\nDo I need a business background to apply to the program?\n\n\nBusiness experience or coursework is not required for our MSBA program. However, we do look for applicants with a keen interest in using analytics to drive business decisions.\n\n\nDoes the Rady School accept students with advanced degrees?\n\n\nWe welcome applications from individuals who have already completed an advanced degree in science, engineering, technology, or other quantitative disciplines. Our program can help you to transfer the skills you have already developed and apply them to address important business problems.\n\n\nWhat are the knowledge prerequisites for the MSBA program?\n\n\nCoursework in subjects such as calculus, linear algebra, econometrics, and advanced statistics and probability will prepare you for our MSBA program. It is also very important to have (some) experience with programming (e.g., Python, R, SQL, C/C++) and statistical applications (e.g., R, SAS, STATA). Accepted applicants are required to complete the Python and R programming DataCamp.com coursework listed below before the start of the program in August.\n\nIntroduction to ChatGPT\nIntroduction to Python\nPandas Foundations\nIntermediate Python for Data Science\nIntroduction to R\nIntermediate R\nIntermediate R: Practice\nReading Data into R with readr\nIntroduction to Shell for Data Science: Manipulating files and directories\n\n\n\nI don't have a (strong) background in some areas. Can I still apply to and be successful in the MSBA program?\n\n\nLong-term success in business analytics requires both strong quantitative foundations and an interest in solving business problems. Applicants that are stronger in one area or the other can still very much be successful in admissions. We will also ensure that all students develop the required skills in AI and machine learning to start a promising career in business analytics upon completion of our MSBA program.\n\n\nHow does the STEM designation make this degree different from other graduate business programs?\n\n\nThe STEM designation allows international students who complete the Rady Full-Time MSBA program on an F-1 student visa the opportunity to extend their post-graduation time in the U.S through Optional Practical Training (OPT) and the STEM OPT Extension. OPT is a type of employment authorization for F-1 students and allows the opportunity for Rady Full-Time MSBA graduates to pursue a 12-month period of relevant work experience upon the completion of their degree.  The STEM OPT extension provides an additional 2-year period to gain work experience in the U.S. in their field of study. For more information on OPT and the 24-month STEM OPT Extension, please visit the International Students & Programs Office OPT webpage.\n\n\nI am a current UCSD undergrad student. What UCSD undergraduate courses do you recommend to prepare for the Rady MSBA program?\n\n\nEligibility RequirementAll students must have conferred their undergraduate degree by the first day of instruction in the program (late July).  Please note that concurrent enrollment is not allowed. \nThe following UCSD undergraduate courses offer relevant preparation for the Rady MSBA program. These courses are not required to apply to or be admitted to the Rady MSBA program. UCSD undergraduates should consult with their undergraduate academic adviser and the UCSD course catalog regarding course availability, enrollment, and applicability to each student’s undergraduate degree requirements. \n\nMGT 3.

Rady faculty are prominent scholars in the fields of finance, behavioral economics, innovation, technology and operations management, marketing, organizational strategy and psychology. The curriculum is designed to be extensive, flexible and personalized, in a self-directed research environment.\nThe Rady Ph.D. program builds upon UC San Diego’s reputation and lineage, which includes 16 Nobel Laureates (former and current faculty) and eight MacArthur Foundation award recipients. We invite you to discuss the opportunities offered by the Rady program with our expert faculty.\nIf you have any questions, please contact the Rady Ph.D. Graduate Coordinator at radyphd@ucsd.edu.\nData from the AACSB indicates that the U.S. shortage of business Ph.D.s is expected to be over 1,000 in five years and nearly 2,500 in 10 years, both in the academic and corporate fields. Graduates with the right background, motivation, ability and training have the opportunity to become the next generation of professors at the world's elite business schools.\nThe Rady Ph.D. program combines faculty expertise, intimate size, strong interdisciplinary training and a desirable location for highly qualified doctoral candidates. The program has a strong research orientation, along with personal attention and mentoring from world-class faculty.\nThe program is a full-time course of study, designed primarily to prepare candidates for an academic career.
