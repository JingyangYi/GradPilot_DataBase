His career has consistently bridged ambitious vision with technical expertise. Before joining Sotheby’s, Engelberg co-founded a food-science AI company (rx-diet.com), demonstrating high engagement with some of the largest U.S. health insurance plans for a demographic historically difficult to engage. Engelberg credits his master’s degree in Applied Analytics (APAN) from Columbia SPS for being the ideal environment to understand data’s role in driving change.\nIn a recent chat with SPS, Engelberg shared his perspective on AI, how his degree prepared him for modern-day success, and what he thinks current students can do to equip themselves with the skills needed to excel in today’s data-driven landscape.\nLooking back, how have the skills you gained from the Applied Analytics program shaped your career trajectory? Are there any specific moments or decisions where those skills made a major difference?\nThe experiences and skills I learned while in the APAN program have opened many opportunities and technical projects that previously seemed remote, while also enabling me to position myself as a product manager. From building and conceptualizing a data lake and warehouse infrastructure, writing code to source alternative data, and developing data models to building state-of-the-art AI & ML products – these experiences and landing my current job would have been beyond reach before I pursued the APAN program.\nAccording to your LinkedIn, AI and machine learning are your two focus areas. How have you seen the landscape of AI and ML shift in the past five years, and how have you adapted to those changes?\nWhile looking at the AI/ML landscape and how much it has evolved over the past few years, I always think back to things I had already learned during APAN, or companies I worked at prior, that now are seen as groundbreaking developments. An example is working on an LLM-based project as my capstone, which was years before LLMs had become mainstream.\nWith a space that has seen so much rapid innovation, I always keep a pulse on the latest developments by reading research papers, attending conferences and following leading companies’ product announcements. While doing so, I consistently consider which business use cases these technologies can solve for and how I can start testing and proving the value behind them.\nIs there a specific issue, challenge, or topic in the field of analytics that you think is particularly relevant to the future of the industry? How can current students prepare for it?\nWhile technologies and use-cases are rapidly developing, there are several areas within analytics that have become more important than ever. Consistent themes that I have seen are areas like data prep—preprocessing and modeling, to funnel and use data for insights and analytics as well as create reusable data assets and make those available via self-serve. Additionally, working with and analyzing unconventional data formats like text, PDFs, etc., has become an important focus with LLM-based technologies rapidly evolving.\nFor a student, preparing for these areas means working on real-world projects and incorporating the latest technologies to try to solve problems programmatically while optimizing for efficiency—i.e., getting to solutioning  as quickly as possible rather than spending time on the data preparation.\nWhat has been the most fulfilling aspect of your career so far, and what goals or projects are you excited to pursue in the next phase of your career?\nThe most fulfilling aspects of my career are tied to tangible customer outcomes and impact. Two specific examples that come to mind are my experiences directly affecting patient outcomes with our AI-based food-science program at RxDiet as well as personalized recommendations we serve to clients of Sotheby’s. What makes these opportunities so rewarding is the ability to see hard work pay off and do so in a meaningful way that goes beyond a business-to-customer transaction.\nIn the next phase of my career, I hope to double down on and create larger opportunities for such impact. Always making sure that the impact is measurable and ties back to solving for the end consumer needs. At Sotheby’s, this means bringing personalization to the forefront of the client experience and making sure customers feel like we consistently meet their needs.\nWhat advice do you have for current students in your program?\nMy answer to this question from an earlier interview still stands, and I can probably not find better words to frame my advice: Find, meet, and learn from people who inspire you. At Columbia, you will continuously be surrounded by people who are highly passionate and willing and able to share their experiences, knowledge, and habits with you. Don’t let a day pass in which you need to ask yourself if you have made the most out of your time, and know that the only person running after you is yourself.\nAbout the Program\nColumbia University’s Master of Science in Applied Analytics prepares students with the practical data and leadership skills to succeed.

The Columbia University School of Professional Studies (SPS) Applied Analytics program offered Wu the skills, experience, and connections to help her land her current position at American Airlines.One year after graduating from SPS, Wu reflected on her time in the program and shared the three pieces of advice she would offer students and recent graduates who are interested in pursuing a career in analytics.What attracted you to the M.S. in Applied Analytics program?\nI joined the Applied Analytics program after I finished my bachelor’s degree in finance and wanted to explore other industries as a data expert. The technical core was very practical and provided me just what I needed in my career, and the program also has a management core which I found very useful. If you’re interested in exploring additional academic interests, you can also leverage the benefits of being part of the Columbia community by cross registering into courses from other schools.\nWhat inspired you to pursue a career in the airline industry?\nRight after a few solo domestic and international flights, I signed up for a Career Design Lab (CDL) information session with American Airlines to explore their career opportunities. I was impressed with the exciting projects they were developing and admired their passion for the airline industry, so I connected with the two representatives at the session and was referred to my current team with the help from my CDL career coach.\nCan you tell us a bit about what your current role entails?\nI leverage advanced analytics to double down on operational excellence and drive operational efficiencies. My responsibilities include using data to identify the root causes of performance bottlenecks, translating analytics into actionable insights, developing performance improvement plans, and tracking solutions performance with Python, SQL, and Tableau.\nHow has your experience in the Applied Analytics program prepared you for this role? What skills or knowledge have you found particularly useful?\nThe Applied Analytics program introduced me to the basics of databases, machine learning, and data visualization, and taught me how to apply analytics across a wide variety of tasks and industries. With project-based experience in areas like natural language processing (NLP), I now have a taste of how analytics has the potential to solve a variety of business problems.\nWhat advice would you give to students and recent graduates who are interested in pursuing a career in analytics?\nFirst, open-mindedness. If you are stuck in one path, look for another. Be dedicated to what you like, but be flexible and resourceful at the same time as you never know if other opportunities are better for you. Second, try to connect the dots when studying analytics. The program is called Applied Analytics, so we understand how to apply our studies to multiple scenarios. Analytics is a tool, and I think those types of abstract topics make more sense to me when I think about how to apply them in the real world.\nFinally, remember that job hunting is as important as your degree. Prepare early and try to connect with people who could help you in your search, including colleagues, professors, and classmates.\nThis interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.\nColumbia University’s Master of Science in Applied Analytics prepares students with the practical data and leadership skills to succeed. The program combines in-depth knowledge of data analytics with the leadership, management, and communication principles and tactics necessary to impact decision-making at all levels within organizations.\nWatch:  Akshay Malhotra ('25SPS, Sustainability Management) reminds incoming students to break out of their shells to truly experience change.\n (YouTube)\nAlumna Randi Fain’s winding journey to medicine and Columbia’s Bioethics program.\nRecent Technology Management graduate Kalia Aragon reflects on the in-person experiences that bookended her journey through the program.\n• Applied Analytics\n[CARD]\nWhat I Wish I Knew: Akshay Malhotra from Sustainability Management\n\nWatch:  Akshay Malhotra ('25SPS, Sustainability Management) reminds incoming students to break out of their shells to truly experience change.\n (YouTube)\nRelated News\nAll News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlumni\n\nWhat I Wish I Knew: Akshay Malhotra from Sustainability Management\n\nWatch:  Akshay Malhotra ('25SPS, Sustainability Management) reminds incoming students to break out of their shells to truly experience change.\n (YouTube) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlumni\n\nHow One Alum Used Her Second Chance at Life to Consider Life-and-Death Questions in Bioethics\n\nAlumna Randi Fain’s winding journey to medicine and Columbia’s Bioethics program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlumni\n\nReflecting on the Technology Management Residencies: Connection, Growth, and New Possibilities in New York City\n\nRecent Technology Management graduate Kalia Aragon reflects on the in-person experiences that bookended her journey through the program.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll News\n[CARD]\nWhat I Wish I Knew: Akshay Malhotra from Sustainability Management\n\nWatch:  Akshay Malhotra ('25SPS, Sustainability Management) reminds incoming students to break out of their shells to truly experience change.\n (YouTube)\nRelated News\nAll News\n[CARD]\nRelated News\nAll News\n[CARD]\nWhat I Wish I Knew: Akshay Malhotra from Sustainability Management\n\nWatch:  Akshay Malhotra ('25SPS, Sustainability Management) reminds incoming students to break out of their shells to truly experience change.\n (YouTube)\nAlumni\n\nWhat I Wish I Knew: Akshay Malhotra from Sustainability Management\n\nWatch:  Akshay Malhotra ('25SPS, Sustainability Management) reminds incoming students to break out of their shells to truly experience change.\n (YouTube)\n[CARD]\nAlumni\n[CARD]\nWhat I Wish I Knew: Akshay Malhotra from Sustainability Management\n\nWatch:  Akshay Malhotra ('25SPS, Sustainability Management) reminds incoming students to break out of their shells to truly experience change.\n (YouTube)\n[CARD]\nWatch:  Akshay Malhotra ('25SPS, Sustainability Management) reminds incoming students to break out of their shells to truly experience change.\n (YouTube)\n[CARD]\n(YouTube)\n[CARD]\nHow One Alum Used Her Second Chance at Life to Consider Life-and-Death Questions in Bioethics\n\nAlumna Randi Fain’s winding journey to medicine and Columbia’s Bioethics program.\nAlumni\n\nHow One Alum Used Her Second Chance at Life to Consider Life-and-Death Questions in Bioethics\n\nAlumna Randi Fain’s winding journey to medicine and Columbia’s Bioethics program.\n[CARD]\nAlumni\n[CARD]\nHow One Alum Used Her Second Chance at Life to Consider Life-and-Death Questions in Bioethics\n\nAlumna Randi Fain’s winding journey to medicine and Columbia’s Bioethics program.\n[CARD]\nAlumna Randi Fain’s winding journey to medicine and Columbia’s Bioethics program.\n[CARD]\nReflecting on the Technology Management Residencies: Connection, Growth, and New Possibilities in New York City\n\nRecent Technology Management graduate Kalia Aragon reflects on the in-person experiences that bookended her journey through the program.\nAlumni\n\nReflecting on the Technology Management Residencies: Connection, Growth, and New Possibilities in New York City\n\nRecent Technology Management graduate Kalia Aragon reflects on the in-person experiences that bookended her journey through the program.\n[CARD]\nAlumni\n[CARD]\nReflecting on the Technology Management Residencies: Connection, Growth, and New Possibilities in New York City\n\nRecent Technology Management graduate Kalia Aragon reflects on the in-person experiences that bookended her journey through the program.\n[CARD]\nRecent Technology Management graduate Kalia Aragon reflects on the in-person experiences that bookended her journey through the program.",

The use of analytics is rapidly becoming ubiquitous across all organizational functions. This course helps students understand how data and analytics are used across different functions to inform decisions that impact the organization. As such, it is the introductory course to the professional practice of applied analytics and the first course in the leadership sequence.\nThe course focuses on data and analytics within operational functions of different kinds of organizations across a range of industry sectors, and the overall ecosystem within which they operate. Students will also learn about the broader context—economic, technological, social, and demographic, and how these trends are influencing the use of analytics. Students learn how data and analytics are used to understand how an organization is currently performing, and how data and analytics can be used to inform future actions to optimize the performance of an organization. The goal is to introduce students to the professional practice of applied analytics, focusing on how analytics can inform a wide range of operational decisions within an organization.\nThe world is generating data at an ever faster pace, including through business transactions, online searches, social media activities, and a variety of sensors. The ready availability of this unprecedented amount of data creates opportunities to predict outcomes and explain phenomena across a wide range of domains from medicine to business to even space exploration. Supervised learning techniques are being extensively used to make useful predictions and generate insights to tackle problems. These predictive analysis techniques are the focus of this course.\nAs the starting point of the two-part Applied Machine Learning sequence, the course guides students through the data-wrangling process, starting with data exploration and other foundational approaches. The course then covers an array of supervised learning techniques including linear regression, decision trees, and support vector machines. Students also have the opportunity to challenge themselves in applying and combining the techniques they have learned through a predictive analytics competition.\nBuilding upon the tools and foundational concepts from Applied Machine Learning I, this course introduces analytic techniques to handle less traditional forms of data, as well as more specialized analytic techniques to help organizations dig more deeply and comprehensively to create value from their data.\nThis course covers unsupervised learning techniques, including clustering, to examine unlabeled data and also covers natural language processing procedures, such as tokenization, to analyze text data. The course further introduces neural networks and other specialized analytics frameworks. Students learn to integrate the techniques that they learned over Parts I and II of the Applied Machine Learning sequence and have the opportunity to apply these tools to real-world problems across topics or industries based on their areas of interest.\nGreat managers of analytic projects are more than mere data users; they are key decision makers and strategic owners in the underlying data processes. This course provides students with foundational context for managing data so that it can be leveraged and used with confidence.\nAnalytic teams work closely with technology partners in managing data. Languages and techniques unique to each team can impede cooperation. To bridge this gap, this course provides a broad overview of data technology concepts including database engines and associated technologies.\nSound policies and procedures are also essentials to ensure high quality of data throughout the analytics lifecycle. But the challenges of putting these measures into practice are significant. There are often legacy repositories and business functions to unravel, as well as social and political barriers to overcome. Data ownership and accountability are hard to implement. Operational disruption and conflicting stakeholder requirements pose additional barriers.\nThis course will expose students to foundational data principles, governance processes and organizational prerequisites needed to overcome challenges to ensure data quality.\nData does not have meaning without context and interpretation. Being able to effectively present data analytics in a compelling narrative to a particular audience will differentiate you from others in your field. This course takes students through the lifecycle of an analytical project from a communication perspective. Students develop written, verbal, and visual deliverables for three major audiences: data experts (e.g., head of analytics); consumer and presentation experts (e.g., chief marketing officer); and executive leadership (e.g., chief executive officer).\nStudents get ample practice in strategic interactions in relevant social and professional contexts (e.g., business meetings, team projects, and one-on-one interactions); active listening; strategic storytelling; and creating persuasive professional spoken and written messages, reports, and presentations. Throughout the course, students create and receive feedback on data storytelling while sharpening their ability to communicate complex analytics to technical and nontechnical audiences with clarity, precision, and influence.\nThis course focuses on the step after insights have been generated from data, and asks the question: what needs to change in an organization's strategy to benefit from those insights? It is the second in the sequence of analytics leadership core courses.\nStudents will learn how to evaluate the strategic environment, the strategic models that might be useful for their organization, and the implementation of a strategy. The course will also ask students to learn theory and research findings and then apply what they have learned to real situations. This will include an exercise in strategic business “wargaming.”\nHaving developed an understanding of organizational strategy, special emphasis is then placed on the interplay between analytics and strategic considerations in an organization. The course teaches students about the practical application of analytics to strategic thinking on two levels: that of the organization (how are analytics used to drive the organization’s strategy?) and the analytics team (how is the organization’s strategy driving the activity of the analytics team?).\nAvailability: Summer and Fall terms only\nThese courses serve as the capstone for the MSAA degree. The capstone requires a synthesis of program content applied to industry challenges, aligning leadership, strategic management, communication, and analytics coursework with analytics projects. The courses will allow students to apply the skills they have learned to solve analytical and organizational challenges.

Your ability to think critically about these issues, assess the capabilities of the available information, and creatively generate new approaches to solving problems can make a large impact. Relative to a traditional job within a single company, a consultant may simultaneously pursue multiple projects across industries and domains.\nThe course provides an immersive experience akin to working as a data scientist in a consultative setting. The course will create a range of diverse experiences across multiple industries with projects of increasing complexity and intertwining ties. As such, the course is designed to convey many of the practical lessons of data science and consulting that are not traditionally conveyed in an academic curriculum. The content of the class will emphasize rapidly learning new analytical paradigms, ranging from technical skills and data structures to business priorities. In addition to solving problems, you will also reevaluate how to structure your own efforts in a way that can improve your productivity and the reliability of your work. The course will also include advanced training in R programming that incorporates the best practices in software design.\nData Science Consulting will apply the skills that you have learned to solve numerous analytical and organizational challenges, integrating the concepts from the technical and managerial cores to help you develop the skills to be successful consultants. In preparation for a consulting role, each student will take on both individual and team-based projects.\nFinancial securities analysis and portfolio management is the study of analyzing information to evaluate financial securities and design investment strategies. Studying the subject can provide a foundation for students entering the fields of investment analysis or portfolio management. This course provides an intensive introduction to major topics in investments. Part I of the course lays the theoretical foundation by introducing the Portfolio Theory and Equilibrium Asset Pricing models. Part II covers the valuation models and analysis of major asset classes: equity, fixed-income, and derivatives. Topics include bond valuation and interest rate models, equity valuation and financial statement analysis, options valuation, other derivatives, and risk management. Part III of the course focuses on the practice of active portfolio management.\nInstructor: Lei Yu\nOrganizations need quantitative analysis to solve complex problems and make consequential choices. Research design provides both a coherent framework for collecting relevant evidence and strategies for evaluating that evidence. Knowledge of research design enables organizations to make adaptive and effective use of quantitative analysis in solving problems and making choices. This course serves as a foundational course in the Applied Analytics program.\nIn this course, you will approach problems as methodological thinkers: you will assess whether the organization is asking the right questions, choosing a relevant design, gathering appropriate and meaningful evidence, and using the appropriate statistical analysis to answer those questions.\nTo varying degrees and in different organizational contexts, we will work to answer some of the following key questions:\nThe Internship in Industry course offers students the preparation to excel in the marketplace with hands-on experience within an organization. The ideal internship will provide students an opportunity to gain tangible and practical knowledge in their chosen field by taking on a position that is closely aligned with their coursework and professional interests.This course is structured around the internship experience. In the first assignment, students will author learning objectives to complete in their internship and review these learning objectives with their site supervisor. Students should also expect that after completing this course they will be able to:\nBefore registering for this course, students must secure an appropriate graduate-level internship, complete the Internship Application Form and receive approval from the academic program. It is highly recommended that domestic students complete at least 12 points (credits) prior to completing an internship. International students must have completed at least two terms before completing an internship and apply for & receive CPT approval through the ISSO Office unless they completed their undergraduate degree in the U.S. and enrolled in graduate school immediately after obtaining their undergraduate degree.\nTo receive approval, the internship must:\nThe successful implementation of analytics depends not only on developing good insights and good strategy, but is also an exercise in managing the necessary changes. The inspiring stories about the importance of analytics today are about how what was learned through analytics was actually implemented to enable an organization to improve its operations, effectiveness, or return on investment.\nThis course--the third in the sequence of analytics leadership core courses—is about changing the behavior and the culture of organizations, with particular emphasis on how to successfully introduce the methods and results of analytics. Students explore the motivations, obstacles and interventions of change, and learn to build alliances, facilitate difficult meetings and develop a transformation plan. The course focuses on practical skills as they are being developed at organizations with pioneering analytics capabilities today.\nStudents will review some of the most important academic research and business publications on change management and the implementation of analytics. However, the course is also intended to enhance practical skills, so students will engage in some real-world practice and role-playing with classmates. As they master each module, students will incrementally develop a plan to introduce analytics into the organization where you currently work, or have worked, or hope to work.\nInstructor: Fatih Bulut\nAnomaly detection helps in the early detection of critical outliers in a system. Based on the context, these outliers can be detrimental and result in loss of resources, and time through errors, fraud, manipulation of stocks, and other such malicious activities. Outliers can also be beneficial for example in investing, and arbitrage. Business decisions that leverage anomaly detection, which used to require intense human resource and capacity can now be completed in a short time through versatile models and automation.\nIn this course, students will learn how to find these unusual occurrences in the data. Students will be provided hands-on experience in multiple contexts with complex datasets that they must further manipulate through industry-specific data engineering. This course will enable students to build advanced supervised and unsupervised machine learning models to find these anomalies. Data engineering in this course will challenge students to engage in techniques of data manipulations with datasets that are NOT perfect.\nThe role of databases in data analytics cannot be overstated; databases facilitate efficient, secure and accurate information storage and retrieval across multiple users and platforms. As a result, proficiency in database design and knowledge of SQL programming are essential skills for the modern analyst and data scientist. This course is designed to help students develop these skills.\nData hardly ever comes ready to be analyzed. In fact, in many analytics projects, –the preparation of data (be it collecting, loading, organizing, filtering, etc.) can take more than 80% of the team’s time and resources, often forcing them to rush through the analyses in order to produce results. This course will demonstrate how relational database design coupled with efficient programming can alleviate the burden of handling messy data, allowing analysts and data scientists to focus on delivering accurate, reliable and reproducible results.\nWhile the Structured Query Language (SQL) has not changed much in the past decade, database systems and the tools that interact with them have continued to evolve. Students will be introduced to the latest programs and database connectors that allow for tight integration with Python and R as well as interactive visualization in Power BI and Tableau.\nAdditionally, students will be exposed to NoSQL database systems optimized for big data analytics and the techniques necessary for interacting with massive amounts of data.\nThis course features a final project in which students will leverage their newfound skills to tackle real-life data management scenarios by designing appropriate database schemas and demonstrating how raw data can be transformed into actionable insights.\nInstructor: Lei Yu\nIn recent years, machine learning techniques have made significant impact in a wide range of application areas in various industries. This course provides an introduction to machine learning concepts and algorithms, as well as the application areas. Topics will include supervised and unsupervised learning, learning theory etc.\nMarket research is the way that companies identify, understand and develop the target market for their products.  It is an important component of business strategy, and it draws on the research and analytics skills you have learned thus far in the program. Often market research consists of generating your own data, through quantitative and qualitative methodologies, in pursuit of the market research question.\nThis course is an elective that will expand on quantitative and qualitative methodologies that have been introduced previously, provide an introduction to other methodologies that are more specific to market research, and provide hands-on practice in defining a market research plan from start to finish. Students will also learn about particular types of market research studies and when and how they should be deployed. Students will generate and test their own research instruments. Through the use of case studies and simulations, students will learn how market research fits into an overarching marketing plan for a company.\nStudents will leave this class understanding the essential aspects of market research, when and how they should be deployed, and the role they could play in small and large companies directing and executing on market research opportunities.\nRequiredAPAN 5300 Research Design\nRecommendedAPAN 5600 Strategy and Analytics\nInstructor: Robert Simione\nPython is one of the leading open source programming languages for data analysis.\nThis is an elective course that explores Python programming languages for data science tasks. The students in this course will learn to examine raw data with the purpose of deriving insights and drawing conclusions. Together, we will manipulate large size data sets to extract meaning and generate visualizations.\nThe course assumes no prior programming experience with Python. We will start by learning the fundamentals of data storage, input and output, control structures, functions, sequence and lists, file I/O, and standard library classes. We will then move on to learning Object-Oriented Programming with Python: encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism.\nTo explore the Python data analysis platform, we will focus on IPython (Interactive Python) and Jupyter Notebook. IPython is an enhanced interactive Python terminal specifically designed for scientific computing and data analysis; Jupyter Notebook is a graphical interface that combines code, text, equations, and plots in a unified interactive environment.\nStudents will learn to work with widely-used libraries, such as pandas for data analysis and statistics; NumPy for its practical multi-dimensional array object; and MatPlotLib for graphical plotting. We will use these libraries to load, explore and visualize real-world datasets.\nIn this course, students will learn concepts that are critical to corporate finance, including: financial statement analysis; performance metrics; valuation of stocks and bonds; project and firm valuation; cost of capital; capital investment strategies and sources of capital, and firm growth strategies. Students will work as individuals and in groups to apply the tools of corporate finance to assigned cases. By the end of this course students will understand:\nHow to apply fundamental corporate finance tools to analysis of firms’ strategic financial decisions.\nEvaluate the value impact of corporate decisions.\nExplain the rationale for decisions related to mergers & acquisitions or other corporate transactions and allocations of capital.\nApply the Four Cornerstones of Corporate Finance in your evaluation of whether a firm has effectively created value.\nIn this course, students will learn fundamental marketing concepts and their application. Students will work extensively with case study projects. By the end of this class students will understand:\nThe essential elements of a market and large-scale company strategy\nHow to identify customers and competition\nThe fundamental elements of the marketing mix (product, price, placement and promotion)\nHow to research consumer behavior and pricing strategies.\nThis course explores key knowledge management and organizational learning concepts and techniques that are critical to business, individual, and organizational performance. As technology and the network economy drive businesses to compete under continuously accelerating rates of change in technology, business leaders must incorporate knowledge management and learning into their organization’s activities in ways that support and propel their business goals. They must also be proactive in recognizing and responding to the influence of technology on these goals and environment(s) in which they are accomplished. Class sessions encompass a set of topics including purpose, planning, success measurement, and implementation of knowledge management initiatives and organizational learning techniques. Through lectures and individual and collaborative work, students explore how they can use these techniques to improve business performance and strengthen their leadership and management capabilities.\nIn this course, students will gain an overview of major concepts of management and organization theory, concentrating on understanding human behavior in organizational contexts, with a heavy emphasis on the application of concepts to solve managerial problems. Students will work in a combination of conceptual and experiential activities, including case studies, discussions, lectures, simulations, videos, and small group exercises.\nBy the end of this course students will:\nAvailability:\nOn Campus: Every termOnline: Every term\nIn this course, students will develop analytical skills used to formulate and implement marketing-driven strategies for an organization. Students will work on case studies in both individual and team-based projects. By the end of this course, students will:\nDevelop a marketing strategy based on market assessments and company needs\nDevelop a deeper understanding of marketing strategies\nLearn how to implement tactics to achieve desired goals\nData modeling is about understanding the data used within our operational and analytics processes, documenting this knowledge in a precise form called the “data model”, and then validating this knowledge through communications with both business and IT stakeholders. Underlying all successful applications is a robust and precise data model, and similarly, most software development failures are due to a lack of understanding of the data or data requirements.\nA data model is therefore an essential part of applications development including forward engineering, reverse engineering, and integration efforts. Forward engineering means focusing on business requirements, whereas reverse engineering means modeling existing systems to drive the support, replacement, or customization of applications. Integration projects such as business intelligence efforts, data lakes, and master data initiatives, require a consistent holistic view of concepts such as Customer, Account, and Product.\nThis course helps students to master data modeling and build data models. Students have the opportunity to explore and create conceptual, logical, and physical data models. Students also learn to work with relational, dimensional, and NoSQL data models. After learning the styles and steps in capturing and modeling requirements, students have the opportunity to apply a best practices approach to building and validating data models through the Data Model Scorecard.\nThis elective course provides students with a strategic understanding of the healthcare ecosystem, knowledge of how different stakeholder groups use data and analytics to inform scientific, clinical and operational decisions, and how state of the art analytics are transforming every aspect of healthcare from how drugs are discovered and developed, to how patients receive treatment, and how population and individual health outcomes are optimized.\nThe adoption of machine learning and AI in healthcare has been slower than in other industry sectors. This may be due in part to the high stakes of healthcare decisions, i.e., patient health outcomes. It is also due in part to the importance of understanding the context of healthcare in the development of analytic solutions, lessons that were learned painfully during the COVID pandemic.  Students will learn how to communicate data and analytics insights to drive trial and adoption by healthcare providers and patients. The course will help students develop the analytics leadership skills that are critical to the realization of the potential of data and analytics to transform healthcare.  Topics include digital health, digital therapeutics, precision medicine, population health, clinical and operational uses of machine learning and AI, and pharmaceutical R&D.\nExponential growth of information and data—combined with software that can understand and learn from analytic experience—provides entrepreneurs with tremendous opportunities to bring innovative customer-focused solutions to market. While there are no direct paths to bring a new product idea to market, there are easily identifiable milestones that can guide the way from idea generation to product profitability. This course will explore the process of early stage development of knowledge-driven, data intensive digital products like Pandora, Netflix, Watson and Trip Advisor. The goal is to create an entrepreneurial experience at its most elemental and visceral level—ideation, brainstorming, interacting with customers, building a founding team, developing a business model, managing risk, investigating competitors, and pitching the business to potential investors. Students will be exposed to all the pressures and demands of real world start-ups by participating on teams tasked with creating deliverables required to launch a new business.\nThis course will provide an overview of life insurance company structure, life insurance products, product development and pricing considerations, investments and the regulations and liabilities that drive life insurance company decisions. All life insurance actuaries must master the concepts of financial mathematics and how to apply those concepts to calculate projected present values and accumulated cash flows. You will study these concepts and apply them to calculate basic reserves, new business pricing, and profitability metrics. This will include exploring various types of product designs. Actuaries play an important part in development and interpretation of the various financial statements that insurance companies are required to provide to the public. The course will illustrate the content of the most important statements, exhibits, and schedules and provide a description of their purpose. Insurance cash flows are unique in that there are many uncertainties and those cash flows stretch out into the future over a considerable amount of time. This leads to another important aspect of actuarial science, which is risk analysis and risk management. This course will study how companies map risks and set aside capital to provide for the uncertainties above and beyond those provided for by standard reserves, including an introduction to evolving uses of predictive analytics and enterprise risk management by insurance companies.\nFinally, the course will cover current evolving trends, e.g., the growth of online life insurance products and services.\nThe goal of this elective course is to provide you with a broad understanding of fixed income securities and how they are used for asset liability management (ALM) in financial institutes. This course is designed for individuals who currently work or plan to work as insurance and financial professionals such as actuaries, traders, and quants. The course builds on concepts introduced in several of the program’s core courses and emphasizes the application of theories. The course covers content adapted from the SOA syllabus for fellowship exams and is split into four parts: interest rate risk measurements, interest rate management—ALM strategy, ALM decision-based asset allocation, and value-based management. In this course, you will learn several ALM techniques related to mitigating interest rate risks, managing risk and return trade-offs, and setting strategic asset allocation (SAA) to achieve an optimized risk/return portfolio. Additionally, you will be introduced to the concepts of value-based management and economic value of liabilities. Completing this course will give you a fundamental basis for understanding ALM in financial organizations and further prepare you to apply these concepts in real-life situations under both generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and market consistent approaches.\nThis course is offered both in an online (synchronous) format as well as in an in-person format.\nThis course is about leading boundary-spanning coalitions. An old African proverb tells us that, \"If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.\" While this advice is especially relevant in our interconnected 21st-century world, we have learned that working together is not always easy to do well.\n“Collaboration at Scale: Leading Boundary-Spanning Coalitions” takes the study of collaboration into an even wider realm by examining the potential and complexity of large-scale, cross-organizational collaboration, and how to lead it.\nThe concept of scalability is common in the business world and this course demonstrates what it takes to make collaboration scalable and suitable for a variety of challenging contexts larger than a single organization. Inherent in the concept of scalability are the notions of \"appropriate scale\" and also \"at scale.\" Both of these notions raise valid questions that we will address in this course. (Though our interpretations of scale have evolved with the advent of social media, specific technology selection is not the focus of the course.)\nStudents will learn the characteristics, conditions and dynamics of various large-scale collaborations, as well as how to design and lead them effectively. Course materials will be drawn from the for-profit and nonprofit worlds. Using a balance of practice and theory of networks and large system facilitation, students will demonstrate their mastery of course materials through an assignment in which they diagnose and (re)design a “collaboration at scale.” This could be in the business, scientific, religious, political, or humanitarian domains.\nProject management has been important to many types of missions, projects, and activities for many years; however, it has been especially critical to the success of large complex projects across decades and centuries.  Large complex projects span the globe across all industries and sectors. They also span concepts, product design, development, manufacturing, operations, and logistics, etc. Products may include hardware, software, services, product support, systems, and systems of systems, etc.\nThe primary focus of this course will be around project leadership as projects are planned and executed (project management).  The course will start by recognizing the need and benefits of project management for large complex global projects, explore characteristics of project managers, and study the commonality and differences in types of projects.  The course will continue with understanding the essential capabilities of project management, and analyze the variations in project lifecycles. The course will address managing risk throughout the project lifecycle, controls, and performance measurement, and maximizing the use of knowledge.  Lastly, the course will visualize the future of projects and project management structure and core capabilities.\nOur fundamental goal is to better prepare leaders for large complex global projects.  This will be gained via readings; real-world case studies; and study, research, analysis, and exploration by the students.  Therefore, the course will require students to engage in reflection, discussion, activities, and assignments aimed at personal unlearning and learning.  The assignment and class discussions will be quite provocative to drive maximum learning.\nThis course is a workshop in ERISA and Taxation Rules for Actuaries. Actuarial science can be applied and cover a number of welfare benefit arrangements (such as life insurance, medical, disability, severance etc.), qualified plans and nonqualified deferred compensation plans. The services and products that are developed in the actuarial field may be governed by certain federal laws. In the U.S., these arrangements are governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\"ERISA\"). In addition, certain federal taxation and reporting rules may apply. To be successful in the field will require an understanding of these rules, reporting requirements, taxation rules and the government agencies (Internal Revenue Service, Department of Labor and Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation) responsible for oversight of such arrangements. Other topics covered will include SEPs, Simple Plans, 403(b) plans, 457 plans and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plans.\nThis course introduces general principles of ratemaking and reserving as they relate to P&C insurance products. Students will learn actuarial conventions and terminology and structure insurance data accordingly. We will discuss techniques needed to restate historical premium and loss information at current levels and derive consistent profitability metrics. Advantages and disadvantages of various traditional pricing and reserving techniques will be discussed as well as classification of insureds and other important topics.\nAs the pace of technological change accelerates, and market and social disruptors lurk around the corner, organizations and policy makers find that traditional hierarchies pose a huge disadvantage. Decision-making is often layered and ponderous, insular cultures block new ideas, and information moves inefficiently. Increasingly, managers find that, to compete, they need novel operating models. Organizations and institutions need to readily access resources and markets. At the same time, they need diverse intelligence, large multidisciplinary data sets, and novel product ideas. The answer lies in the network, an organizational construct that involves people engaging across boundaries, organizations, and/or geographies with shared knowledge-creation goals.\nFor-profit and nonprofit organizations, alike are embracing networks to share insights and data, act as a voting block, serve customers, and innovate. For example Proctor & Gamble, World Health Organization, the World Bank, and German Aerospace and Technology Center are all leveraging networks. The ideas of “open” and “contagion” are no longer seen as a rarified university experiment. Now these present a viable means for a growing number of purposes: get to market faster, thwart climate change, clean the oceans, and find cures to intractable diseases.\n“The Science of Communities and Networks” presents the quantitative structure, impacts, and practical work of networks. There are many different forms of network, varying in size, shape and purpose. Yet there are some common practices and behavior patterns and models that trace their origins back to the science of the human brain, mathematics and social and behavioral psychology. After computing and interpreting the metrics of social network structure, we will use the Knowledge Network Effectiveness Framework, a logic model flowing backwards from outcomes, to individual and social behavior, to dynamics, to design. We will also use other scholarly research, along with practical cases, to study different network forms: communities of practice, knowledge-networks, crowds, open source, open data, and open innovation. Students will envision, diagnose and design networks for “cooperative advantage.” We will do that while considering that networks operate in the context of human bias, complex contagion, common-pool resource dilemmas, and technology advancement.\nIKNS and other SPS students will find that the course incorporates both social science and data science on the future of work, in which operations and innovation come increasingly from parties outside the organization or department. The course relates to three main themes of the IKNS curriculum, digital transformation, future of work, and collaboration.\nThis course teaches cutting-edge tools and methods that drive investment decisions at quantitative trading firms, and, more generally, firms applying machine learning to big data. The course will combine presentations of theory, immediately followed by in-class Python programming examples using real financial data. The course will develop a general approach to building models of economic and financial processes, with a focus on statistical learning techniques that scale to large data sets. Among the topics covered are lasso, elastic net, cross validation, Bayesian models, the EM algorithm, Support Vector Machines, kernel methods, Gaussian processes, Hidden Markov Models, and neural networks. The final project will lead the students to build a trading strategy based on the techniques learned throughout the course.\nHow do businesses and their employees navigate the rules and regulations that govern their operation? No matter what the industry, understanding the legal landscape is essential in today’s business environment. This course introduces the fundamental laws and principles governing businesses in the U.S. today. The effect of recent developments in case law and legislation on these topics will be discussed and debated in class.\nAt the end of the course, students will have a solid understanding of the role the law plays in doing business across industries.\nAmong the topics to be discussed are:\nHow are ideas, products, and innovations protected? Every industry must ask these questions and understanding how the law works to answer them is an invaluable tool in today’s marketplace.This course introduces the fundamental principles of U.S. intellectual property law. The course will explore the basic concepts of copyright law including the requirements for copyright protection and the types of works protected, what rights and limitations come with copyright protection, and how the law is enforced. The course will also cover the main tenets of trademark law, including discussion of the Lanham Act, dilution, and unfair competition. Recent developments and controversies, including intellectual property protection for new technologies and the difficulty of enforcing protections on the Internet will also be discussed.\nIn this course, we will explore negotiation from several points of view and approaches. We will also look at characteristics that impact the quality of our negotiations and the outcomes, such as the role of emotions, cultural considerations, effectiveness of our communication, and opportunities to seek out negotiation to transform relationships. The course will be a blend of concepts and skills, theory and practice. On some occasions, you will be introduced to a concept and then asked to apply those concepts in an experiential activity. At other times, you will be asked to engage the activity or simulation and then the concepts will be elicited based on your experience. You will have several opportunities to practice developing your skills throughout the course, in terms of enhancing your practice and honing your analytical and conceptual understanding.\nThis course is a foundation course for learning software programming using the Java language.

Practical applications will demonstrate how to prepare, train, test, and validate models.\nThe course introduces practitioners of environmental science and sustainability management to the data analysis techniques and statistical methods which are indispensable to their work. The class teaches how to build statistical substantiation and to critically evaluate it in the context of environmental problems. The statistics topics and examples have been chosen for their special relevance to environmental problems, including applications in environmental monitoring, impact assessment, environmental valuation techniques and econometric analyses of sustainable development. Students are assumed to have had no previous exposure to statistics.\nThe course will focus on sustainability indicators, the process through which they were developed, and how they are used to shape policy and track progress. This course will examine the science and history of our current environmental crisis with a focus on the various policy initiatives and actions being taken globally and locally including the specific efforts of the C40 Cities (40 largest cities) to both mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and prepare for the impacts of climate change. The class will look at case studies from different cities around the world as well as New York City's efforts through PlaNYC while introducing the principles underlying sustainability indicators-including greenhouse gas inventory protocols-and how they are used to influence and shape policies and decisions, and will offer students hands-on experience with these tools.\nThe goal of this is to make students acquainted with the debate, challenges, and opportunities of a changing climate. The course will focus on the solutions and responses to the climate change challenges facing cities using real world and current examples. The course will survey a broad range of responses to climate change from international frameworks and global treaties to specific actions at the local level. Students will be required to critically evaluate what they have read and heard. In addition, the course will give students an opportunity to learn how to express their ideas verbally and in written form and conduct critical analysis of environmental data to develop and implement public policy.\nAssignments will give students the opportunity to use their technical and analytical skills while understanding the real world applications that will be important to their future professional work as planners, policymakers, advocates, architects, designers, and/or environmentalists. This course satisfies the M.S. in Sustainability Management's quantitative analysis requirement.\nUnderwriting\nThe University reserves the right to withdraw or modify the courses of instruction or to change the instructors as may become necessary.\nWe encourage you to apply as soon as possible.\nStay in the know with updates sent straight to your inbox.\n• 36 points (credits) for degree completion\n• On-campus and online instruction*\n• Fall and spring intake\n• Six consecutive terms to complete\n• Part-Time New York City (Fall or Spring Intake)\n• Part-Time Online (Fall Intake only)\n• Part-Time Online (Fall Intake only): This option does not qualify for a student visa.\n• The Management Core will help you develop an enterprise-wide perspective on data and the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to inspire, create, and foster an analytical culture within an organization.\n• The Technical Core will introduce you to the methods and range of tools and systems that organizations use to conceptualize, collect, manage, and analyze data to produce information to make it actionable across their enterprise.\n• Linear Algebra: Matrices, matrix-vector multiplication, linear models, change of basis, dimensionality, spectral decomposition, and principal component analysis (PCA).\n• Calculus: Rates of change, derivatives, optimization techniques like gradient descent, with a brief touch upon linear approximation.\n• Probability and Statistics: Mathematically deriving complex probability distributions out of simpler ones, mathematically deriving statistical testing methods\n• Graph Theory: How graphs are used to find relationships among data as well as being a setting for AI-driven problem solving.\n• Problem Solving and Algorithms: Applying mathematical concepts to find problem solutions.

listing is for students starting the program in fall 2018 or later.\nInternational students are responsible for ensuring they have read and understand the University’s student visa application eligibility and requirements. Please note that it is not permissible to enroll while in B-1/B-2 status. In addition, if studying on a student visa, you must enroll full-time (12 points/credits per term) and study on campus. Students on an F1 visa are permitted to complete no more than one online class each semester.\nThe program consists of required courses in two core areas:\nThe curriculum consists of six core courses (18 credits), five elective courses (15 credits), and one Capstone course (3 credits).  For your elective study, you will align the foundational skills you've developed in the two core areas with five courses you choose that are pertinent to your academic and professional goals. Elective courses are offered in a wide range of subjects, including applied deep learning and AI, cloud computing, cybersecurity, finance, healthcare analytics, market research, and natural language processing.\nYou may choose to pursue a concentration (see below), in which four of the five elective courses must be concentration-specific. Choosing a concentration is not required for the degree but is optional.\nCompleting your Capstone course, you will apply what you have learned in the two core components to a real-world analytics project.\nInternational students who wish to take fewer than 12 points (credits) in their final term should plan their courses with their advisor.\nNote: Students who enrolled in the program prior to fall 2018 are required to follow the fall 2017–spring 2018 curriculum.\nApplied analytics is about the strategic use of data and analytics to inform decisions within an operating environment. The use of analytics is rapidly becoming ubiquitous across all organizational functions. This course helps students understand how data and analytics are used across different functions to inform decisions that impact the organization. As such, it is the introductory course to the professional practice of applied analytics and the first course in the leadership sequence.\nThe course focuses on data and analytics within operational functions of different kinds of organizations across a range of industry sectors, and the overall ecosystem within which they operate. Students will also learn about the broader context—economic, technological, social, and demographic, and how these trends are influencing the use of analytics. Students learn how data and analytics are used to understand how an organization is currently performing, and how data and analytics can be used to inform future actions to optimize the performance of an organization. The goal is to introduce students to the professional practice of applied analytics, focusing on how analytics can inform a wide range of operational decisions within an organization.\nThe world is generating data at an ever faster pace, including through business transactions, online searches, social media activities, and a variety of sensors. The ready availability of this unprecedented amount of data creates opportunities to predict outcomes and explain phenomena across a wide range of domains from medicine to business to even space exploration. Supervised learning techniques are being extensively used to make useful predictions and generate insights to tackle problems. These predictive analysis techniques are the focus of this course.\nAs the starting point of the two-part Applied Machine Learning sequence, the course guides students through the data-wrangling process, starting with data exploration and other foundational approaches. The course then covers an array of supervised learning techniques including linear regression, decision trees, and support vector machines. Students also have the opportunity to challenge themselves in applying and combining the techniques they have learned through a predictive analytics competition.\nGreat managers of analytic projects are more than mere data users; they are key decision makers and strategic owners in the underlying data processes. This course provides students with foundational context for managing data so that it can be leveraged and used with confidence.\nAnalytic teams work closely with technology partners in managing data. Languages and techniques unique to each team can impede cooperation. To bridge this gap, this course provides a broad overview of data technology concepts including database engines and associated technologies.\nSound policies and procedures are also essentials to ensure high quality of data throughout the analytics lifecycle. But the challenges of putting these measures into practice are significant. There are often legacy repositories and business functions to unravel, as well as social and political barriers to overcome. Data ownership and accountability are hard to implement. Operational disruption and conflicting stakeholder requirements pose additional barriers.\nThis course will expose students to foundational data principles, governance processes and organizational prerequisites needed to overcome challenges to ensure data quality.\nData does not have meaning without context and interpretation. Being able to effectively present data analytics in a compelling narrative to a particular audience will differentiate you from others in your field. This course takes students through the lifecycle of an analytical project from a communication perspective. Students develop written, verbal, and visual deliverables for three major audiences: data experts (e.g., head of analytics); consumer and presentation experts (e.g., chief marketing officer); and executive leadership (e.g., chief executive officer).\nStudents get ample practice in strategic interactions in relevant social and professional contexts (e.g., business meetings, team projects, and one-on-one interactions); active listening; strategic storytelling; and creating persuasive professional spoken and written messages, reports, and presentations. Throughout the course, students create and receive feedback on data storytelling while sharpening their ability to communicate complex analytics to technical and nontechnical audiences with clarity, precision, and influence.\nBuilding upon the tools and foundational concepts from Applied Machine Learning I, this course introduces analytic techniques to handle less traditional forms of data, as well as more specialized analytic techniques to help organizations dig more deeply and comprehensively to create value from their data.\nThis course covers unsupervised learning techniques, including clustering, to examine unlabeled data and also covers natural language processing procedures, such as tokenization, to analyze text data. The course further introduces neural networks and other specialized analytics frameworks. Students learn to integrate the techniques that they learned over Parts I and II of the Applied Machine Learning sequence and have the opportunity to apply these tools to real-world problems across topics or industries based on their areas of interest.\nThis course focuses on the step after insights have been generated from data, and asks the question: what needs to change in an organization's strategy to benefit from those insights? It is the second in the sequence of analytics leadership core courses.\nStudents will learn how to evaluate the strategic environment, the strategic models that might be useful for their organization, and the implementation of a strategy. The course will also ask students to learn theory and research findings and then apply what they have learned to real situations. This will include an exercise in strategic business “wargaming.”\nHaving developed an understanding of organizational strategy, special emphasis is then placed on the interplay between analytics and strategic considerations in an organization. The course teaches students about the practical application of analytics to strategic thinking on two levels: that of the organization (how are analytics used to drive the organization’s strategy?) and the analytics team (how is the organization’s strategy driving the activity of the analytics team?).\nAvailability: Summer and Fall terms only\nThese courses serve as the capstone for the MSAA degree. The capstone requires a synthesis of program content applied to industry challenges, aligning leadership, strategic management, communication, and analytics coursework with analytics projects. The courses will allow students to apply the skills they have learned to solve analytical and organizational challenges.

International students must have completed at least two terms before completing an internship and apply for & receive CPT approval through the ISSO Office unless they completed their undergraduate degree in the U.S. and enrolled in graduate school immediately after obtaining their undergraduate degree.\nTo receive approval, the internship must:\nThe successful implementation of analytics depends not only on developing good insights and good strategy, but is also an exercise in managing the necessary changes. The inspiring stories about the importance of analytics today are about how what was learned through analytics was actually implemented to enable an organization to improve its operations, effectiveness, or return on investment.\nThis course--the third in the sequence of analytics leadership core courses—is about changing the behavior and the culture of organizations, with particular emphasis on how to successfully introduce the methods and results of analytics. Students explore the motivations, obstacles and interventions of change, and learn to build alliances, facilitate difficult meetings and develop a transformation plan. The course focuses on practical skills as they are being developed at organizations with pioneering analytics capabilities today.\nStudents will review some of the most important academic research and business publications on change management and the implementation of analytics. However, the course is also intended to enhance practical skills, so students will engage in some real-world practice and role-playing with classmates. As they master each module, students will incrementally develop a plan to introduce analytics into the organization where you currently work, or have worked, or hope to work.\nInstructor: Fatih Bulut\nAnomaly detection helps in the early detection of critical outliers in a system. Based on the context, these outliers can be detrimental and result in loss of resources, and time through errors, fraud, manipulation of stocks, and other such malicious activities. Outliers can also be beneficial for example in investing, and arbitrage. Business decisions that leverage anomaly detection, which used to require intense human resource and capacity can now be completed in a short time through versatile models and automation.\nIn this course, students will learn how to find these unusual occurrences in the data. Students will be provided hands-on experience in multiple contexts with complex datasets that they must further manipulate through industry-specific data engineering. This course will enable students to build advanced supervised and unsupervised machine learning models to find these anomalies. Data engineering in this course will challenge students to engage in techniques of data manipulations with datasets that are NOT perfect.\nThe role of databases in data analytics cannot be overstated; databases facilitate efficient, secure and accurate information storage and retrieval across multiple users and platforms. As a result, proficiency in database design and knowledge of SQL programming are essential skills for the modern analyst and data scientist. This course is designed to help students develop these skills.\nData hardly ever comes ready to be analyzed. In fact, in many analytics projects, –the preparation of data (be it collecting, loading, organizing, filtering, etc.) can take more than 80% of the team’s time and resources, often forcing them to rush through the analyses in order to produce results. This course will demonstrate how relational database design coupled with efficient programming can alleviate the burden of handling messy data, allowing analysts and data scientists to focus on delivering accurate, reliable and reproducible results.\nWhile the Structured Query Language (SQL) has not changed much in the past decade, database systems and the tools that interact with them have continued to evolve. Students will be introduced to the latest programs and database connectors that allow for tight integration with Python and R as well as interactive visualization in Power BI and Tableau.\nAdditionally, students will be exposed to NoSQL database systems optimized for big data analytics and the techniques necessary for interacting with massive amounts of data.\nThis course features a final project in which students will leverage their newfound skills to tackle real-life data management scenarios by designing appropriate database schemas and demonstrating how raw data can be transformed into actionable insights.\nInstructor: Lei Yu\nIn recent years, machine learning techniques have made significant impact in a wide range of application areas in various industries. This course provides an introduction to machine learning concepts and algorithms, as well as the application areas. Topics will include supervised and unsupervised learning, learning theory etc.\nMarket research is the way that companies identify, understand and develop the target market for their products.  It is an important component of business strategy, and it draws on the research and analytics skills you have learned thus far in the program.

As technology and the network economy drive businesses to compete under continuously accelerating rates of change in technology, business leaders must incorporate knowledge management and learning into their organization’s activities in ways that support and propel their business goals. They must also be proactive in recognizing and responding to the influence of technology on these goals and environment(s) in which they are accomplished. Class sessions encompass a set of topics including purpose, planning, success measurement, and implementation of knowledge management initiatives and organizational learning techniques. Through lectures and individual and collaborative work, students explore how they can use these techniques to improve business performance and strengthen their leadership and management capabilities.\nIn this course, students will gain an overview of major concepts of management and organization theory, concentrating on understanding human behavior in organizational contexts, with a heavy emphasis on the application of concepts to solve managerial problems. Students will work in a combination of conceptual and experiential activities, including case studies, discussions, lectures, simulations, videos, and small group exercises.\nBy the end of this course students will:\nAvailability:\nOn Campus: Every termOnline: Every term\nIn this course, students will develop analytical skills used to formulate and implement marketing-driven strategies for an organization. Students will work on case studies in both individual and team-based projects. By the end of this course, students will:\nDevelop a marketing strategy based on market assessments and company needs\nDevelop a deeper understanding of marketing strategies\nLearn how to implement tactics to achieve desired goals\nData modeling is about understanding the data used within our operational and analytics processes, documenting this knowledge in a precise form called the “data model”, and then validating this knowledge through communications with both business and IT stakeholders. Underlying all successful applications is a robust and precise data model, and similarly, most software development failures are due to a lack of understanding of the data or data requirements.\nA data model is therefore an essential part of applications development including forward engineering, reverse engineering, and integration efforts. Forward engineering means focusing on business requirements, whereas reverse engineering means modeling existing systems to drive the support, replacement, or customization of applications. Integration projects such as business intelligence efforts, data lakes, and master data initiatives, require a consistent holistic view of concepts such as Customer, Account, and Product.\nThis course helps students to master data modeling and build data models. Students have the opportunity to explore and create conceptual, logical, and physical data models. Students also learn to work with relational, dimensional, and NoSQL data models. After learning the styles and steps in capturing and modeling requirements, students have the opportunity to apply a best practices approach to building and validating data models through the Data Model Scorecard.\nThis elective course provides students with a strategic understanding of the healthcare ecosystem, knowledge of how different stakeholder groups use data and analytics to inform scientific, clinical and operational decisions, and how state of the art analytics are transforming every aspect of healthcare from how drugs are discovered and developed, to how patients receive treatment, and how population and individual health outcomes are optimized.\nThe adoption of machine learning and AI in healthcare has been slower than in other industry sectors. This may be due in part to the high stakes of healthcare decisions, i.e., patient health outcomes. It is also due in part to the importance of understanding the context of healthcare in the development of analytic solutions, lessons that were learned painfully during the COVID pandemic.  Students will learn how to communicate data and analytics insights to drive trial and adoption by healthcare providers and patients. The course will help students develop the analytics leadership skills that are critical to the realization of the potential of data and analytics to transform healthcare.  Topics include digital health, digital therapeutics, precision medicine, population health, clinical and operational uses of machine learning and AI, and pharmaceutical R&D.\nExponential growth of information and data—combined with software that can understand and learn from analytic experience—provides entrepreneurs with tremendous opportunities to bring innovative customer-focused solutions to market. While there are no direct paths to bring a new product idea to market, there are easily identifiable milestones that can guide the way from idea generation to product profitability. This course will explore the process of early stage development of knowledge-driven, data intensive digital products like Pandora, Netflix, Watson and Trip Advisor. The goal is to create an entrepreneurial experience at its most elemental and visceral level—ideation, brainstorming, interacting with customers, building a founding team, developing a business model, managing risk, investigating competitors, and pitching the business to potential investors. Students will be exposed to all the pressures and demands of real world start-ups by participating on teams tasked with creating deliverables required to launch a new business.\nThis course will provide an overview of life insurance company structure, life insurance products, product development and pricing considerations, investments and the regulations and liabilities that drive life insurance company decisions. All life insurance actuaries must master the concepts of financial mathematics and how to apply those concepts to calculate projected present values and accumulated cash flows. You will study these concepts and apply them to calculate basic reserves, new business pricing, and profitability metrics. This will include exploring various types of product designs. Actuaries play an important part in development and interpretation of the various financial statements that insurance companies are required to provide to the public. The course will illustrate the content of the most important statements, exhibits, and schedules and provide a description of their purpose. Insurance cash flows are unique in that there are many uncertainties and those cash flows stretch out into the future over a considerable amount of time. This leads to another important aspect of actuarial science, which is risk analysis and risk management. This course will study how companies map risks and set aside capital to provide for the uncertainties above and beyond those provided for by standard reserves, including an introduction to evolving uses of predictive analytics and enterprise risk management by insurance companies.\nFinally, the course will cover current evolving trends, e.g., the growth of online life insurance products and services.\nThe goal of this elective course is to provide you with a broad understanding of fixed income securities and how they are used for asset liability management (ALM) in financial institutes. This course is designed for individuals who currently work or plan to work as insurance and financial professionals such as actuaries, traders, and quants. The course builds on concepts introduced in several of the program’s core courses and emphasizes the application of theories. The course covers content adapted from the SOA syllabus for fellowship exams and is split into four parts: interest rate risk measurements, interest rate management—ALM strategy, ALM decision-based asset allocation, and value-based management. In this course, you will learn several ALM techniques related to mitigating interest rate risks, managing risk and return trade-offs, and setting strategic asset allocation (SAA) to achieve an optimized risk/return portfolio. Additionally, you will be introduced to the concepts of value-based management and economic value of liabilities. Completing this course will give you a fundamental basis for understanding ALM in financial organizations and further prepare you to apply these concepts in real-life situations under both generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and market consistent approaches.\nThis course is offered both in an online (synchronous) format as well as in an in-person format.\nThis course is about leading boundary-spanning coalitions. An old African proverb tells us that, \"If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.\" While this advice is especially relevant in our interconnected 21st-century world, we have learned that working together is not always easy to do well.\n“Collaboration at Scale: Leading Boundary-Spanning Coalitions” takes the study of collaboration into an even wider realm by examining the potential and complexity of large-scale, cross-organizational collaboration, and how to lead it.\nThe concept of scalability is common in the business world and this course demonstrates what it takes to make collaboration scalable and suitable for a variety of challenging contexts larger than a single organization. Inherent in the concept of scalability are the notions of \"appropriate scale\" and also \"at scale.\" Both of these notions raise valid questions that we will address in this course. (Though our interpretations of scale have evolved with the advent of social media, specific technology selection is not the focus of the course.)\nStudents will learn the characteristics, conditions and dynamics of various large-scale collaborations, as well as how to design and lead them effectively. Course materials will be drawn from the for-profit and nonprofit worlds. Using a balance of practice and theory of networks and large system facilitation, students will demonstrate their mastery of course materials through an assignment in which they diagnose and (re)design a “collaboration at scale.” This could be in the business, scientific, religious, political, or humanitarian domains.\nProject management has been important to many types of missions, projects, and activities for many years; however, it has been especially critical to the success of large complex projects across decades and centuries.  Large complex projects span the globe across all industries and sectors. They also span concepts, product design, development, manufacturing, operations, and logistics, etc. Products may include hardware, software, services, product support, systems, and systems of systems, etc.\nThe primary focus of this course will be around project leadership as projects are planned and executed (project management).  The course will start by recognizing the need and benefits of project management for large complex global projects, explore characteristics of project managers, and study the commonality and differences in types of projects.  The course will continue with understanding the essential capabilities of project management, and analyze the variations in project lifecycles. The course will address managing risk throughout the project lifecycle, controls, and performance measurement, and maximizing the use of knowledge.  Lastly, the course will visualize the future of projects and project management structure and core capabilities.\nOur fundamental goal is to better prepare leaders for large complex global projects.  This will be gained via readings; real-world case studies; and study, research, analysis, and exploration by the students.  Therefore, the course will require students to engage in reflection, discussion, activities, and assignments aimed at personal unlearning and learning.  The assignment and class discussions will be quite provocative to drive maximum learning.\nThis course is a workshop in ERISA and Taxation Rules for Actuaries. Actuarial science can be applied and cover a number of welfare benefit arrangements (such as life insurance, medical, disability, severance etc.), qualified plans and nonqualified deferred compensation plans. The services and products that are developed in the actuarial field may be governed by certain federal laws. In the U.S., these arrangements are governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\"ERISA\"). In addition, certain federal taxation and reporting rules may apply. To be successful in the field will require an understanding of these rules, reporting requirements, taxation rules and the government agencies (Internal Revenue Service, Department of Labor and Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation) responsible for oversight of such arrangements. Other topics covered will include SEPs, Simple Plans, 403(b) plans, 457 plans and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plans.\nThis course introduces general principles of ratemaking and reserving as they relate to P&C insurance products. Students will learn actuarial conventions and terminology and structure insurance data accordingly. We will discuss techniques needed to restate historical premium and loss information at current levels and derive consistent profitability metrics. Advantages and disadvantages of various traditional pricing and reserving techniques will be discussed as well as classification of insureds and other important topics.\nAs the pace of technological change accelerates, and market and social disruptors lurk around the corner, organizations and policy makers find that traditional hierarchies pose a huge disadvantage. Decision-making is often layered and ponderous, insular cultures block new ideas, and information moves inefficiently. Increasingly, managers find that, to compete, they need novel operating models. Organizations and institutions need to readily access resources and markets. At the same time, they need diverse intelligence, large multidisciplinary data sets, and novel product ideas. The answer lies in the network, an organizational construct that involves people engaging across boundaries, organizations, and/or geographies with shared knowledge-creation goals.\nFor-profit and nonprofit organizations, alike are embracing networks to share insights and data, act as a voting block, serve customers, and innovate. For example Proctor & Gamble, World Health Organization, the World Bank, and German Aerospace and Technology Center are all leveraging networks. The ideas of “open” and “contagion” are no longer seen as a rarified university experiment. Now these present a viable means for a growing number of purposes: get to market faster, thwart climate change, clean the oceans, and find cures to intractable diseases.\n“The Science of Communities and Networks” presents the quantitative structure, impacts, and practical work of networks. There are many different forms of network, varying in size, shape and purpose. Yet there are some common practices and behavior patterns and models that trace their origins back to the science of the human brain, mathematics and social and behavioral psychology. After computing and interpreting the metrics of social network structure, we will use the Knowledge Network Effectiveness Framework, a logic model flowing backwards from outcomes, to individual and social behavior, to dynamics, to design. We will also use other scholarly research, along with practical cases, to study different network forms: communities of practice, knowledge-networks, crowds, open source, open data, and open innovation. Students will envision, diagnose and design networks for “cooperative advantage.” We will do that while considering that networks operate in the context of human bias, complex contagion, common-pool resource dilemmas, and technology advancement.\nIKNS and other SPS students will find that the course incorporates both social science and data science on the future of work, in which operations and innovation come increasingly from parties outside the organization or department. The course relates to three main themes of the IKNS curriculum, digital transformation, future of work, and collaboration.\nThis course teaches cutting-edge tools and methods that drive investment decisions at quantitative trading firms, and, more generally, firms applying machine learning to big data. The course will combine presentations of theory, immediately followed by in-class Python programming examples using real financial data. The course will develop a general approach to building models of economic and financial processes, with a focus on statistical learning techniques that scale to large data sets. Among the topics covered are lasso, elastic net, cross validation, Bayesian models, the EM algorithm, Support Vector Machines, kernel methods, Gaussian processes, Hidden Markov Models, and neural networks.
