Round 2 is the final deadline for applicants graduating from international institutions and those desiring full scholarship consideration.\nAt Goizueta, we invest in women to create a new generation of empowered leaders that will break through the barriers and positively impact business and society.\nThe Rosemary and John Brown Family Scholars Program is a $5 million scholarship endowment open to graduates of Spelman College and Agnes Scott College who are accepted into a Goizueta graduate program. Scholarships are merit-based. Brown Family Scholars admitted into any of Goizueta’s graduate programs will benefit from small-by-design program classes known for a collaborative culture and highly experiential learning model. This will help scholars to formally build camaraderie and continue with mentoring and networking during the remainder of their studies.\nGoizueta Women in Business (GWIB) offers professional and personal development opportunities at Goizueta. You'll meet like-minded, accomplished women who seek growth beyond the classroom. Through GWIB-sponsored networking, speakers, social events, community service and communication, you'll foster relationships within and beyond Emory. And with each activity, you'll develop not only your community, but also your contribution to others. Open to all Goizueta graduate students.\nThe Goizueta Student-Alumni Mentor Program is designed to help students bridge the gap between the academic and professional world through the practical insights, coaching, and experience of the Goizueta alumni network. Through the Alumni Mentor Program, you're paired with an alumna—or alumnus if you prefer—according to shared areas of interest and affinity preferences. In your mentor, you'll find the voice of experience, a sounding board, and a perspective that helps expand your own.\nThe Center for Women at Emory helps Emory University provide the best possible environment for women as students, scholars, and employees. We advocate for gender equity throughout the university; provide resources and skill-building opportunities; and bring faculty, students, practitioners, activists, and other learners together to examine gender issues and work toward ethical solutions.\nDiversity is one of our core values, and we celebrate diversity through the experiences and knowledge of our faculty, staff, students, and alumni. Through our DEI office, student organizations, and special initiatives, we seek to not only create an environment in which students thrive but also to change issues of systemic inequality in business.\nGoizueta Pride Alliance supports LGBTQ+ professionals and allies at Emory’s Goizueta Business School through community, events, and service. Select events include an annual Out in Business panel during which alumni can share their experiences about being out–or not–in the workplace with current students and LGBTQ+ allies and participation in Atlanta Pride, one of the oldest and largest pride festivals in the U.S.\nGoizueta is proud to have veteran alumni representing each of the U.S. military branches. We're consistently ranked a Military Friendly School, and are proud to be a Yellow Ribbon School since 2009.\nEach of our graduate business programs offers a competitive advantage for students from all U.S. military branches. An Emory business degree elevates the skills you've honed during your military career and helps you push the boundaries of what you thought possible for your career whether that is advancing within the military or transitioning to a career in business.\nThe Yellow Ribbon Program is a provision of the Post 9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008 (aka Chapter 33), and students must first be eligible for the Post 9/11 GI Bill. Please contact the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to see if you are eligible and to request a Certificate of Eligibility (COE). According to the VA, you must use your full GI Bill funding before Yellow Ribbon funding is used.\nGoizueta Business School provides up to 100 Yellow Ribbon awards per year ($2.56M annually), which is matched by the Veterans Administration. Candidates eligible for Yellow Ribbon funding will also be considered for merit-based scholarships.\nYellow Ribbon awards are provided on a first come, first serve basis and candidates are encouraged to apply to Goizueta and submit a deposit upon acceptance to secure funding. Historically, Goizueta has been able to provide Yellow Ribbon support to all eligible students.\nTo demonstrate our support of military applicants, Goizueta is associated with the Military Consortium, an organization under the umbrella of the Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC). Through this association, we offer the following benefits for applicants with military experience.\nThe makeup of the international student body at Goizueta reflects our strong commitment to providing a global experience for all students to actively learn from each other about the interplay of cultural, political, and business practices around the world.\nAll applicants who earned an undergraduate degree outside of the United States must submit a completed application which includes: transcripts with a seal from the issuing institution from all undergraduate and graduate institutions attended, a current résumé, official GMAT or GRE score, TOEFL score (if applicable), two recommendations, essays, and the application fee. Applications are not reviewed until these criteria are met.\nThis is a STEM-designated masters program. Most international students on a student F-1 visa have the option to obtain work experience following the completion of their degree through a program called Optional Practical Training (OPT). OPT is a form of training – often paid – that relates to your field of study.

Scholarships are merit-based. Brown Family Scholars admitted into any of Goizueta’s graduate programs will benefit from small-by-design program classes known for a collaborative culture and highly experiential learning model. This will help scholars to formally build camaraderie and continue with mentoring and networking during the remainder of their studies.\nGoizueta Women in Business (GWIB) offers professional and personal development opportunities at Goizueta. You'll meet like-minded, accomplished women who seek growth beyond the classroom. Through GWIB-sponsored networking, speakers, social events, community service and communication, you'll foster relationships within and beyond Emory. And with each activity, you'll develop not only your community, but also your contribution to others. Open to all Goizueta graduate students.\nThe Goizueta Student-Alumni Mentor Program is designed to help students bridge the gap between the academic and professional world through the practical insights, coaching, and experience of the Goizueta alumni network. Through the Alumni Mentor Program, you're paired with an alumna—or alumnus if you prefer—according to shared areas of interest and affinity preferences. In your mentor, you'll find the voice of experience, a sounding board, and a perspective that helps expand your own.\nThe Center for Women at Emory helps Emory University provide the best possible environment for women as students, scholars, and employees. We advocate for gender equity throughout the university; provide resources and skill-building opportunities; and bring faculty, students, practitioners, activists, and other learners together to examine gender issues and work toward ethical solutions.\n[CARD]\nDiversity is one of our core values, and we celebrate diversity through the experiences and knowledge of our faculty, staff, students, and alumni. Through our DEI office, student organizations, and special initiatives, we seek to not only create an environment in which students thrive but also to change issues of systemic inequality in business.\nGoizueta Pride Alliance supports LGBTQ+ professionals and allies at Emory’s Goizueta Business School through community, events, and service. Select events include an annual Out in Business panel during which alumni can share their experiences about being out–or not–in the workplace with current students and LGBTQ+ allies and participation in Atlanta Pride, one of the oldest and largest pride festivals in the U.S.\nThe Goizueta Student-Alumni Mentor Program is designed to help students bridge the gap between the academic and professional world through the practical insights, coaching, and experience of the Goizueta alumni network. Through the Alumni Mentor Program, you're paired with an alumna—or alumnus if you prefer—according to shared areas of interest and affinity preferences.

We're consistently ranked a Military Friendly School, and are proud to be a Yellow Ribbon School since 2009.\nEach of our graduate business programs offers a competitive advantage for students from all U.S. military branches. An Emory business degree elevates the skills you've honed during your military career and helps you push the boundaries of what you thought possible for your career whether that is advancing within the military or transitioning to a career in business.\nThe Yellow Ribbon Program is a provision of the Post 9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008 (aka Chapter 33), and students must first be eligible for the Post 9/11 GI Bill. Please contact the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to see if you are eligible and to request a Certificate of Eligibility (COE). According to the VA, you must use your full GI Bill funding before Yellow Ribbon funding is used.  \nGoizueta Business School provides up to 100 Yellow Ribbon awards per year ($2.56M annually), which is matched by the Veterans Administration. Candidates eligible for Yellow Ribbon funding will also be considered for merit-based scholarships.\nYellow Ribbon awards are provided on a first come, first serve basis and candidates are encouraged to apply to Goizueta and submit a deposit upon acceptance to secure funding. Historically, Goizueta has been able to provide Yellow Ribbon support to all eligible students.\nTo demonstrate our support of military applicants, Goizueta is associated with the Military Consortium, an organization under the umbrella of the Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC). Through this association, we offer the following benefits for applicants with military experience.\n\nApplications accepted after standard deadlines for deployed military personnel\nWaived application fees for military personnel and veterans\nOne-year deferment available if admitted military student is delayed by their service branch\n[CARD]\nThe makeup of the international student body at Goizueta reflects our strong commitment to providing a global experience for all students to actively learn from each other about the interplay of cultural, political, and business practices around the world.\nAll applicants who earned an undergraduate degree outside of the United States must submit a completed application which includes: transcripts with a seal from the issuing institution from all undergraduate and graduate institutions attended, a current résumé, official GMAT or GRE score, TOEFL score (if applicable), two recommendations, essays, and the application fee. Applications are not reviewed until these criteria are met.\n\n\n\n\n\nSTEM Degree\nThis is a STEM-designated masters program. Most international students on a student F-1 visa have the option to obtain work experience following the completion of their degree through a program called Optional Practical Training (OPT). OPT is a form of training – often paid – that relates to your field of study.

The program attracts students aspiring to become effective data scientists by exploring the intersection of business, data, and technology. Over the course of the STEM-designated program, students learn data visualization, artificial intelligence, machine learning, managing big data, social network analytics, and more.\n“We are thrilled to welcome the new MS in Business Analytics Class of 2025. These students represent a talented group from all around the world,” says Zuzana Hlavacova Gurung, associate dean of specialized masters programs. “The program now offers four curriculum tracks in AI in Business, Business Analytics, Marketing Analytics, and Supply Chain Analytics. We are excited to provide students the opportunity to further tailor their academic experience and personalize their analytics career path.”\nGoizueta’s 2025 cohort of the MS in Business Analytics program is a globally diverse group. The program’s 74 students represent 13 countries and bring with them an average of 3.2 years of work experience. In addition, nearly half of the students are women (47 percent), and 85 percent of the cohort hail from outside of the United States. Also an ambitious group, 14 percent of the students are pursuing a dual degree at Goizueta, one of the only business schools in the country to offer such a pairing.\nProject-based learning is at the heart of the MS in Business Analytics program. Every student in the program takes part in a semester-long experiential learning opportunity. This practicum project puts the students’ foundational coursework and training to task. As part of this project, student teams join forces with corporate sponsors to solve current, real-world business problems. Ramnath Chellappa, professor of information systems and operations management and academic director for MS in Business Analytics, calls the practicum the “crown jewel” of the program. He refers to the practicum as “a kind of internship.”\n“The students go on to solve a real business problem that really matters to our client,” Chellappa explains. “That way, the students verify that all the techniques that they’ve learned are applicable to what the industry cares about.”\nEach year, the business analytics program hosts the day-long Business Analytics Conference. This past April, more than 200 industry practitioners, alumni, academics, and students gathered to network, share insights, and discuss emerging trends.\nGoizueta’s STEM-designated MS in Business Analytics combines business, data, and technology to make you an effective business data scientist for a data-driven world. Learn more.\n• PROGRAMS\n\nUndergraduate\nGraduate\nPhD\nExecutive

So, when she heard about the Travelers University Modeling Competition, the first one to be held at Goizueta, she decided, “why not?” If Qiu did well, she thought, she might earn an interview or even a job with Travelers, the second-largest commercial insurance carrier in the United States. Regardless, the competition would give Qiu a valuable experiential learning opportunity to work on a real business problem provided by a real company. So, she recruited two of her classmates and entered the competition.\nAs part of the challenge, Travelers asked the students to imagine they worked as modelers for the company’s fraud detection department and tasked them with creating a predictive model that could help the company identify the key drivers that cause fraudulence. “The problems that we put out there for modeling competitions are not easy, and they tend to be of the type where the answer is not obvious,” explains Girish Modgil, SVP and chief AI officer at Travelers and a member of the MS in Business Analytics program’s curriculum advisory board. “It allows them to get direct and real time feedback from industry leaders on what they’re learning.”\nTeams that are the most accurate or precise in terms of the metrics Travelers looks for in the competition generally do well, noted Modgil. “But it’s also about the communication,” he says. “How [the teams] are able to communicate about what the problem was, how they tackled it, how they worked together, how they brought diverse opinions and thought to it, and how they were able to cobble together an answer that was presentable and showed some progress toward achieving a solution.”\nQiu and her team went on to win the competition. She believes her team won, in part, because of its presentation and its business insights.\nEveryone can do modeling. What really makes you stand out are your communication skills, your presentations skills.\nAs a result of the competition, Qiu earned an interview—and ultimately a job—at Travelers. There, she builds pricing models for small commercial lines of business as a senior associate data scientist in the Data Science Leadership Development Program, a three year rotational program at Travelers. Qiu, who lives in Atlanta, also became Travelers’ campus representative for the modeling competition and, in 2024, took on the role of organizing the event. “I was happy to take the lead and give back to the program because I know they are awesome students,” Qiu says. “They deserve to have this opportunity to show off their skills.”\nThis past year, 30 teams from eight different schools—including three teams from Goizueta’s MS in Business Analytics program—presented as part of the Travelers University Modeling Competition. Two Goizueta teams tied for first place.\n“For our MS in Business Analytics students, these experiential learning opportunities aren’t just valuable—they’re fundamental,” says Scott Radcliffe, the program’s managing director. “They transform classroom concepts into tangible skills, preparing our graduates not just to analyze data, but to drive impactful business decisions from day one.”\nIn 2024 Travelers, headquartered in New York, NY, opened a 2,800 square-foot office in Midtown Atlanta’s Technology Square. The site houses the company’s AI, data science, and other technology operations. “As part of our continued expansion and involvement in the community, we want to make sure that when we hire the talent, they’re well-equipped with the coursework and the experience that they ought to have to come in and start driving value,” says Modgil. “With that in mind, the best way is to go to the source.”\nIn addition to the modeling competition, Modgil’s work on the MS in Business Analytics program’s advisory board allows him to gather insights from students. During the advisory board’s bi-annual meetings, a handful of current Goizueta students are selected to give presentations on their research interests and career aspirations. “We get to see and experience what the current crop of students are hoping to do—and possibly adjust the ways we interview and recruit accordingly,” says Modgil. “And from an academic perspective, Scott and his team learn what is current, what companies are looking for and the types of skills we need.”\nWhen asked about her current role, Qiu explains that while she builds the pricing models first, she needs feedback from the teams using the models to make sure they work and work well. “My role actually involves a lot of presentations—delivering your model and your business insights to your business partners,” Qiu explains. “It’s a really good combination of technical and business.” This is something Modgil also underscores when describing Goizueta’s MS in Business Analytics program as “the perfect intersection” of business and data analytics. “Since Goizueta is such a good business school, you see a more well-rounded candidate coming out of the program,” says Modgil.\nTo learn about career opportunities at Travelers, please visit https://careers.travelers.com/\nLearn how Goizueta’s MS in Business Analytics program turns data-driven students into business-ready leaders.

Tracks include: AI in Business, Business Analytics, Marketing Analytics, and Supply Chain Analytics.\nComplete your degree in 10-months (July start and graduate the following May) or extend your experience by completing a summer internship and 9 additional credit hours in a second fall semester (graduate in December).\nThis course is a refresher of critical math skills you will use regularly in your MSBA Classes. Topics covered include: Calculus Review, Basic Probability, Random Variables and Probability Distributions, Sampling and Sampling Distributions, Bayesian Approach, Matrices, and Logarithms. Bootcamp does not teach these subjects but rather refreshes the student’s prior knowledge of the aforementioned topics.\nThis course refreshes the students’ knowledge of programming for data manipulation and analysis. built upon a prior knowledge of programming, the course will conduct exercises in R, Python, SQL and other languages. students will also be using a variety of unix tools, file-transfer methods, etc. Course may also employ cloud-based services such as AWS and/or Azure.\nThis course introduces students to economics of business and provides an overview of a variety of business functions including marketing, strategy, operations, finance, etc. The course familiarizes students with commonly used frameworks in business.\nThis course runs throughout the length of the program. Students are provided the basis to abstract a business problem into a data-based problem and provided a methodology commonly adopted by consulting firms. The course then combines the consulting method with the CRISP-DM framework commonly used in data science projects. This course provides the foundation for managing projects in the capstone course.\nThis course examines how statistical methods lead to understanding and describing data. We use R/RStudio to review basic data exploration and statistical methods. Topics covered include simple descriptive statistics through hypothesis testing and modeling.\nIn this course, students gain competence in practical database, data warehousing, and data management skills with emphasis on query, data modeling, ETL, and data management. They will also become familiar with major elements of the big data ecosystem.\nWe will study the fundamental principles and techniques of data mining in order to extract useful information and knowledge from data. We will improve our ability to approach problems \"data-analytically,” examine real-world examples that place data mining in context, and apply data-mining techniques while working hands-on with data mining projects. The course will provide an understanding of the general framework for building and evaluating predictive models, both for classification and numeric prediction data mining tasks. The course will cover supervised predictive modeling techniques as well as unsupervised predictive modeling techniques.\nThis is an introduction to basic concepts in machine learning, both supervised and unsupervised. The basic ideas of neural networks will be presented. Machine learning from data streams (online learning) using stochastic gradient descent is also covered.\nWhere the art of graphic design meets with the science of data analytics. Learn how to perform exploratory analysis through visualization, how to create professional-looking visualizations for use in business reports and presentations, and how to design interactive visualizations and dashboards.\nDelve into a number of selected current and emerging data analytics areas that are increasingly important for organizations. Areas include advanced elements of the predictive modeling process, ensemble methods, cost-aware data analytics, mining text and data, recommender systems, and other advanced topics.\nThis course introduces students to optimization and simulation, powerful techniques for better decision-making (in particular, linear, integer and non-linear programming), and Monte Carlo and discrete event simulation, and discuss their application to problems in business and data analytics.\nThe MSBA Analytics Practicum leverages skills and techniques learned throughout the course of the program and applies them to real-world business situations. Students formally define problems, clean data, aggregate with other data sources, and identify and use appropriate analytical techniques to address questions.\nThis course will introduce students to state-of-the-art quant models. Students will individually develop quant models and back-test them using archival data. Students will learn to address the following issues:\nThis course introduces the theories and practices for modern project management: methodologies for organizing effort, quantitative tools for planning and evaluating project risk and progress, and inter-personal skills for leading and communicating with various project stakeholders. Topics include the role of project and portfolio management, organizational structures, and their influence on project management, managing scope and specifications, planning and network scheduling, monitoring, and reporting, costing, risk management. We will use network analysis, simulation, decision trees, and linear optimization methods relevant to project management.\nHands-on, gentle introduction to the tools that data scientists use to forecast the future, including bleeding-edge methods developed by the instructor. You will learn how to apply these tools to applications ranging from demand forecasting to algorithmic trading to real time warning systems for adverse medical events. We will cover time series forecasting from both the classical as well as the machine learning perspectives in the R environment, one of the industry standards in data science.\nThis course will begin discussion process analytics including process metrics, types of variability, process control (statistical process control), and process capability analysis. It will then move on to discuss issues relating to causal analysis. This will lead to a discussion of experimentation in organizations, one-factor experiments (A/B testing), one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), two-way ANOVA, factorial designs, and fractional factorial designs.\nDeep learning models aim to recognize complex patterns in pictures, text, sounds, and other data to produce accurate insights and predictions, and reinforcement learning methods focus on learning how to map situations to actions, so as to maximize a reward. ISOM 678 introduces some of the key ideas and techniques developed from the machine learning communities on deep learning and reinforcement learning, with an emphasize on the practical understanding and implementations of these techniques in real world business problems. In this course, algorithms and concepts are presented to build intuition for how different methods work, without advanced mathematics. Topics include single- and multi- layer networks, convolutional and recurrent neural networks, multi-armed bandits, finite Markov decision processes and on-policy and off-policy data methods. Programming is central to the course and is based on the R and Python programming languages.\nThe course introduces modern data-driven supply chain management techniques. Specific focus will be on supply chain resiliency and efficiency. The topics include deep-tier supply network visibility, supply risk identification, demand and lost sales estimation, data-driven sales and operations planning, and inventory management. We will use graph-theoretic, simulation, econometric, and operations research methods relevant to supply chain management.\nAI in Marketing examines the burgeoning role of AI in marketing decisions and actions. The course will adopt the customer equity framework, which links the value of the customer to the organization to the following components: customer acquisition, customer retention, and relationship development. The course will be built around these components, examining the application of marketing technology and AI to support growth through each component. We will use the customer journey to tie these components together.\nPricing is a critical business activity and one that is often viewed as a significant challenge. In this course we will take a hands-on approach to developing pricing tactics and strategies. Using data whenever possible we will explore techniques for setting prices in a variety of contexts.\nThis course will focus on the use of analytic methods to solve marketing problems. Problems will be drawn from a variety of contexts including pricing, customer relationship management and sales forecasting. The course will emphasize the use of marketing analytics as a means of supporting decision making. Toward this end, we will emphasize the development of tools that can be implemented in practice. We will rely on both frequentist and Bayesian methodologies.\nOver the past decade, a professional sports team's decision processes have been transformed from being based mainly on intuition and experience, to being based on copious amounts of data and sophisticated statistical models; this trend has even been highlighted in popular culture through the bestselling book and blockbuster movie, \"Moneyball\".

We will use network analysis, simulation, decision trees, and linear optimization methods relevant to project management.\n[CARD]\nHands-on, gentle introduction to the tools that data scientists use to forecast the future, including bleeding-edge methods developed by the instructor. You will learn how to apply these tools to applications ranging from demand forecasting to algorithmic trading to real time warning systems for adverse medical events. We will cover time series forecasting from both the classical as well as the machine learning perspectives in the R environment, one of the industry standards in data science.\n[CARD]\nThis course will begin discussion process analytics including process metrics, types of variability, process control (statistical process control), and process capability analysis. It will then move on to discuss issues relating to causal analysis. This will lead to a discussion of experimentation in organizations, one-factor experiments (A/B testing), one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), two-way ANOVA, factorial designs, and fractional factorial designs.\n[CARD]\nDeep learning models aim to recognize complex patterns in pictures, text, sounds, and other data to produce accurate insights and predictions, and reinforcement learning methods focus on learning how to map situations to actions, so as to maximize a reward. ISOM 678 introduces some of the key ideas and techniques developed from the machine learning communities on deep learning and reinforcement learning, with an emphasize on the practical understanding and implementations of these techniques in real world business problems. In this course, algorithms and concepts are presented to build intuition for how different methods work, without advanced mathematics. Topics include single- and multi- layer networks, convolutional and recurrent neural networks, multi-armed bandits, finite Markov decision processes and on-policy and off-policy data methods. Programming is central to the course and is based on the R and Python programming languages.\n[CARD]\nThe course introduces modern data-driven supply chain management techniques. Specific focus will be on supply chain resiliency and efficiency. The topics include deep-tier supply network visibility, supply risk identification, demand and lost sales estimation, data-driven sales and operations planning, and inventory management. We will use graph-theoretic, simulation, econometric, and operations research methods relevant to supply chain management.\n[CARD]\nAI in Marketing examines the burgeoning role of AI in marketing decisions and actions. The course will adopt the customer equity framework, which links the value of the customer to the organization to the following components: customer acquisition, customer retention, and relationship development. The course will be built around these components, examining the application of marketing technology and AI to support growth through each component. We will use the customer journey to tie these components together.\n[CARD]\nPricing is a critical business activity and one that is often viewed as a significant challenge. In this course we will take a hands-on approach to developing pricing tactics and strategies. Using data whenever possible we will explore techniques for setting prices in a variety of contexts.\n[CARD]\nThis course will focus on the use of analytic methods to solve marketing problems.
