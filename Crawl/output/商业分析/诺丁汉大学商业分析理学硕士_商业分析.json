The topics covered include:\n\nmodelling principles\noptimisation and linear programming\nnetwork models\nintroduction to integer programming\nkey concepts of probability and uncertainty\ndecision theory\nqueuing systems\nsimulation\n\n\n\r\n            Supply Chain Planning and Management\r\n                20 credits\n\n\nThe module takes a dual approach covering both the business processes and the quantitative models and techniques necessary for supply chain planning and management. It is divided into three major parts.\n\nSupply chain concepts and definitions:\n\nFundamental planning and control concepts for supply chain and operations planning: classification of operational and supply systems\nInventory - forms, functions, decisions, models\nCapacity - definitions and planning\n\n\nForecasting for supply chain and production management:\n\nPlanning, scheduling and control approaches: aggregate planning, hierarchical planning and control\nMRP-based planning and control\nJIT principles, kanban systems\nTheory of Constraints (TOC)\nEnterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems\n\n\nSupply chain collaboration:\n\nPlanning and control across the supply chain\nThe bullwhip effect\nSupply chain collaboration approaches – continuous replenishment\nVendor-Managed Inventory (VMI)\nCollaborative Planning Forecasting and Replenishment (CPFR)\n\n\n\n\n\nSemester two\nCore modules\n\n\r\n            Analytics Specialisations and Applications\r\n                20 credits\n\n\nAn in-depth look at specialised analytical techniques which present significant opportunities within business environments to extract actionable insights. Applications covered include Recommender Systems (for example, collaborative filtering in business), Text Analytics (linguistic processing, social media analysis), Spatial/Temporal analytics (for example, financial time series), Network analytics (for example, social graph analysis) and High dimensional analytics.\n\n\r\n            Leading Big Data Business Projects\r\n        \n\nThis module explicitly focuses on technologies, planning and managerial issues associated with leading big data projects in business. Key concepts revolve around:\n\nusing data analytics in context (integration of qualitative and quantitative approaches, introduction to survey methods and design)\nthe full data lifecycle (including data management and security)\nintroduction to organisational scale IT infrastructure\nethics\nproject management \npresentation skills\n\n\n\r\n            Machine Learning and Predictive Analytics\r\n                20 credits\n\n\nThis module builds on Foundational Business Analytics covering more advanced predictive models and their motivation within business use cases. Students will establish knowledge of state-of-the-art prediction techniques including SVMs, temporal Nearest Neighbour models, Bayesian methods, Ensembles and Deep Learning.\nPractical exercises will be set against a range of real world datasets and time series data. Focusing on the applicability of models to real world problems the module will consider the appropriateness and utility of each method with respect to common ''tricky'' data properties in real world data that lead to under-performing models.\nExamples include unbalanced classes, heterogeneous input feature types and detrimentally large number of input features. Within the module methods to unpack the various predictive models to understand why they predict what they do and the utility of this information in various business contexts will be covered.\nThis module is taught primarily using Python against a background of industrial workflow data modelling environments (for example, SPSS Modeller, Orange) where applicable.\n\n\nOptional modules\nOne from:\n\n\r\n            Advanced Operations Analysis\r\n        \n\nModule content is organised around four themes:\n\nMore ‘advanced’ forecasting techniques (including more advanced time series and causal models)\nInventory modelling (quantity discount models; joint replenishment; reorder point – lot size systems; periodic review models; news vendor model; (S-1, S) model; multi-warehouse situations)\nShop floor control: WIP and Little’s law; introduction to operations scheduling and sequencing\nIntroduction to distribution logistics modelling, reverse logistics and closed-loop supply chains\n\n\n\r\n            Digital Marketing\r\n        \n\nLecture topics may include digital marketing definition and concept, digital marketing media, digital marketing communication strategy, digital advertising, social media marketing, email marketing, mobile marketing, content marketing, e-commerce vs digital vs internet marketing.\n\n\nSummer\n\n\r\n            Data Driven Dissertation Project in Business Analytics\r\n        \n\nRepresenting the culmination of the programme, you will design, execute and report a research project based on the analysis of real-world or simulated data. This includes an 8,000-word dissertation, exhibits and data visualisations, and will need to satisfy scholarly objectives consistent with the execution of quality applied research in a business or social context.\n\n\nThe above is a sample of the typical modules we offer but is not intended to be construed and/or relied upon as a definitive list of the modules that will be available in any given year. Modules (including methods of assessment) may change or be updated, or modules may be cancelled, over the duration of the course due to a number of reasons such as curriculum developments or staffing changes.

The tuition fee deposit is offset against the tuition fee when you register on your MSc course.\nIf you require a Student Visa to study in the UK this tuition fee deposit is separate and in addition to your £3,000 CAS (Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies) deposit.\nSecuring funding for postgraduate study (Masters or Doctorate) can be a complicated and competitive process. Follow the link below to investigate your funding options. It is important that when you start your course you have sufficient funds, or an achievable plan in place to obtain funds, to cover both your tuition fees and living costs.\nFunding for postgraduate students\nNottingham University Business School is pleased to announce scholarship funding for high-performing Masters applicants due to start in September 2025. Reaching up to 30% of the total fee, our scholarships aim to attract the most talented students from a wide range of academic backgrounds.Please be aware that funding is limited, therefore we strongly encourage you to apply for your MSc programme as soon as possible. Once funding limits have been met, we cannot issue further scholarships.Please note there is no separate application process for Business School scholarships - all those who receive an offer and have a strong 2:1 equivalent grade will automatically be considered. We are unfortunately unable to inform unsuccessful candidates due to the high volume of applications.Find out more about additional scholarship opportunities, including regional international Masters scholarships.\nWe offer a £5,000 alumni tuition fee scholarship for applicants who hold, or are due to receive, a University of Nottingham degree. If you are expected to graduate with a strong 2:1 in your Bachelors degree, you will be assessed for the Alumni Scholarship following receipt of your MSc course offer. You do not need to apply separately for this scholarship.\nPlease be aware that funding is limited, therefore we strongly encourage you to apply for your MSc programme as soon as possible.

Evidence of relevant personal, professional and educational experience may be taken into consideration. Generally an undergraduate degree will be required, but we may be able to consider experience-based qualifications on a case-by-case basis. Contact the academic school directly for further information.\nInternational and EU students can find guidance on alternative qualifications on our country-specific webpages.\nAll applicants, both home and international, are required to hold English language qualifications at an appropriate level in order to study at the university. If you're a native English speaker, or you have studied in an English-speaking country or institution, we may be able to accept your academic qualifications as evidence of your English language ability.\nIELTS requirements are detailed on our course pages, though we also accept a variety of alternative qualifications.\nIf you require additional support to develop your language skills, you may be able to attend a pre-sessional course at the Centre for English Language Education.\nSome courses require work experience, or other entry requirements, or to demonstrate knowledge of the course. Please check our course pages for details.\nTeaching for most postgraduate taught courses starts late September, while some have alternative start dates. Check course pages for details on start dates and course specific deadlines.\nFor standard late September starts, the application deadline is usually around six to seven weeks before the start date for international applicants. For specific dates for international and home applicants, please check our application deadline information.\nWe will endeavour to make a decision on your application within six weeks of submitting your application and paying your application fee (if required).\nInternational applicants, you should apply as early as possible to ensure that you have enough time to apply for your student visa. If you are successful in receiving an offer, you will need to accept it and meet any outstanding conditions by early September (for our late September start), or as advised by the admissions team.\nAn offer of study is required for many funding opportunities. You should check deadlines for applications carefully, as these are often early in the year. Please apply early and allow time for any fee payments and your application to be processed to avoid disappointment. If you have a known deadline for funding (for example, scholarship, sponsorship etc), we encourage you to make us aware of it in your application.\nYou can apply directly through our online system. You will receive automatic confirmation once you submit your application and can track its progress.\nMake sure that you upload clear scanned copies of your degree certificate (if completed) and final or current transcript, as well as any other supporting documents. We will not be able to assess your application without them. Please do not send us the original copies in the post, as we will be unable to return these.\nDepending on the course you are applying for, you may also need to provide two references, including at least one who can comment on your academic ability. These must be dated within two years of the date of your application and, if not submitted directly by your referee, signed and on letter-headed paper. We may also require a personal statement. If you aren't sure what to include or need more help, please refer to our guidance or contact us.\nApplications for teacher training are made through DfE Apply and MA Social Work are made through UCAS.\nYour application provides an opportunity for you to articulate the skills and experiences you have that make you suitable for a place on our courses. We understand that AI tools can be beneficial in terms of helping you to structure things such as personal statements, or to check for readability. However, please be aware that an over-reliance on AI carries risks, such as falsely generated claims and the potential for the generated work to be of poor quality. Generating all, or a large part of your application submissions and communications regarding your application, using an AI tool and presenting this as your own work or words could affect the outcome of your application.\nThere is an application fee of £50 for postgraduate taught courses.\nApply online\nYou can log in at any time to track the progress of your application.\nTrack your application\nInternational students who are planning to start a full-time postgraduate taught course will be required to pay a tuition fee deposit of at least £3,000 for start dates between August 2025 and July 2026, or £4,500 for start dates from August 2026 onwards, as part of the visa process.\nWe will waive the tuition fee deposit requirement for students who are fully sponsored by a recognised sponsor. If you are fully sponsored for your course fees, you must email us a copy of your sponsorship letter, quoting your full name and application ID.\nThe university will only accept sponsorship letters from recognised sponsors such as overseas governments, international businesses, universities, trusts and charities, and not from friends/family members.\nAdmissions may, at their discretion, ask applicants to provide further information in order to assess their application fairly and accurately. This can include CVs, references (academic and professional) and clarifications regarding their previous and current education. In such cases you will be contacted by admissions via email with a more information request.\nWhen we have made a decision on your application, we will send you an email and let you know what you need to do next.\nDetails on accepting your offer, accommodation and other helpful hints and tips can be found our guidance for applicants.\nStudent Recruitment Support Hub    \n+44 (0) 115 951 5559\nMake an enquiry\nBrowser does not support script.\nConnect with the University of Nottingham through social media and our blogs.\nCampus maps | More contact information | Jobs\n• UK\n• China\n• Malaysia\n• Study\n• About\n• Research\n• Business\n• News\n• Visit\n• A–Z\n• Postgraduate study\n• Why Nottingham?\n• Courses\n• How to apply\n\n\nTaught courses\nResearch coursesHow to write a research proposalApply online\n• Taught courses\n• Research courses\n• How to write a research proposal\n• Apply online\n• Fees\n• Funding\n• Visiting us\n• Already applied?\n• Doctoral Training Programmes\n• Researcher Academy\n• Make an enquiry\n• Taught courses\n• Research courses\n• How to write a research proposal\n• Apply online\n• Print\n• Email this Page\n• If you are interested in a PhD or Research Master's, please see our guidance\n• If you are interested in one of our Pre-sessional English courses, please see our guidance\n• If you are hoping to study with us for part of a degree awarded elsewhere, please contact us\n• Check course requirements\n• Check key dates and deadlines\n• Submit your application\n• Track your application\n• Copyright\n• Terms and conditions\n• Privacy\n• Posting rules\n• Accessibility\n• Freedom of information\n• Charity gateway\n• Cookie policy\n• Cookie Settings\n[CARD]\n1. Check course requirements\nAcademic requirements\nAcademic requirements vary by programme – check our course pages for details. Evidence of relevant personal, professional and educational experience may be taken into consideration. Generally an undergraduate degree will be required, but we may be able to consider experience-based qualifications on a case-by-case basis. Contact the academic school directly for further information.\nInternational and EU students can find guidance on alternative qualifications on our country-specific webpages.\nEnglish requirements\nAll applicants, both home and international, are required to hold English language qualifications at an appropriate level in order to study at the university. If you're a native English speaker, or you have studied in an English-speaking country or institution, we may be able to accept your academic qualifications as evidence of your English language ability. \nIELTS requirements are detailed on our course pages, though we also accept a variety of alternative qualifications.\nIf you require additional support to develop your language skills, you may be able to attend a pre-sessional course at the Centre for English Language Education.\nAny other requirements\nSome courses require work experience, or other entry requirements, or to demonstrate knowledge of the course. Please check our course pages for details.\n[CARD]\n2. Check key dates and deadlines\nTeaching for most postgraduate taught courses starts late September, while some have alternative start dates. Check course pages for details on start dates and course specific deadlines.\nFor standard late September starts, the application deadline is usually around six to seven weeks before the start date for international applicants. For specific dates for international and home applicants, please check our application deadline information.\nWe will endeavour to make a decision on your application within six weeks of submitting your application and paying your application fee (if required).\nInternational students\nInternational applicants, you should apply as early as possible to ensure that you have enough time to apply for your student visa. If you are successful in receiving an offer, you will need to accept it and meet any outstanding conditions by early September (for our late September start), or as advised by the admissions team.\nFunding deadlines\nAn offer of study is required for many funding opportunities. You should check deadlines for applications carefully, as these are often early in the year. Please apply early and allow time for any fee payments and your application to be processed to avoid disappointment. If you have a known deadline for funding (for example, scholarship, sponsorship etc), we encourage you to make us aware of it in your application.\n[CARD]\n3. Submit your application\nYou can apply directly through our online system. You will receive automatic confirmation once you submit your application and can track its progress.\nMake sure that you upload clear scanned copies of your degree certificate (if completed) and final or current transcript, as well as any other supporting documents. We will not be able to assess your application without them. Please do not send us the original copies in the post, as we will be unable to return these.\nDepending on the course you are applying for, you may also need to provide two references, including at least one who can comment on your academic ability. These must be dated within two years of the date of your application and, if not submitted directly by your referee, signed and on letter-headed paper. We may also require a personal statement. If you aren't sure what to include or need more help, please refer to our guidance or contact us.\nApplications for teacher training are made through DfE Apply and MA Social Work are made through UCAS.\nUse of Artificial Intelligence (AI)\nYour application provides an opportunity for you to articulate the skills and experiences you have that make you suitable for a place on our courses. We understand that AI tools can be beneficial in terms of helping you to structure things such as personal statements, or to check for readability. However, please be aware that an over-reliance on AI carries risks, such as falsely generated claims and the potential for the generated work to be of poor quality. Generating all, or a large part of your application submissions and communications regarding your application, using an AI tool and presenting this as your own work or words could affect the outcome of your application.\nApplication fee\nThere is an application fee of £50 for postgraduate taught courses.\nApply online\n[CARD]\n4. Track your application\nYou can log in at any time to track the progress of your application.\nTrack your application\nTuition fee deposit\nInternational students who are planning to start a full-time postgraduate taught course will be required to pay a tuition fee deposit of at least £3,000 for start dates between August 2025 and July 2026, or £4,500 for start dates from August 2026 onwards, as part of the visa process.\nWe will waive the tuition fee deposit requirement for students who are fully sponsored by a recognised sponsor. If you are fully sponsored for your course fees, you must email us a copy of your sponsorship letter, quoting your full name and application ID.\nThe university will only accept sponsorship letters from recognised sponsors such as overseas governments, international businesses, universities, trusts and charities, and not from friends/family members.\nFurther information requests\nAdmissions may, at their discretion, ask applicants to provide further information in order to assess their application fairly and accurately. This can include CVs, references (academic and professional) and clarifications regarding their previous and current education. In such cases you will be contacted by admissions via email with a more information request.\nApplication outcome\nWhen we have made a decision on your application, we will send you an email and let you know what you need to do next.\nDetails on accepting your offer, accommodation and other helpful hints and tips can be found our guidance for applicants.",
