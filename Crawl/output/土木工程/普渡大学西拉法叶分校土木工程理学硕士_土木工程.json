Burke Graduate Program in Civil Engineering has approximately 400 active students. It has been consistently ranked in the top 10 of U.S. News and World Reports and is currently ranked 5th.\nIn April 2017, in recognition of the Burke Family generosity and commitment to Purdue, the School named its graduate program the Christopher B. and Susan S. Burke Graduate Program.\nChris Burke said the unique educational opportunities and experiences he and his family received are among the reasons for the gift to Civil Engineering.\n\"We feel very close to this university,\" he said.\nThe Burkes also are excited about the progress of the school, ranked last year as the top civil engineering institution in the world by Shanghai Rankings.\n\"We think that the direction the university is headed is fantastic and we really want to do our part and to keep that great tradition of excellence,\" Burke said. \"We believe this will help carry that tradition on.\"\nFour generations of the Burke family have received 38 degrees at Purdue over the years.\nRao S. Govindaraju, Bowen Engineering Head and Christopher B. and Susan S. Burke Professor of Civil Engineering, said Lyles School of Civil Engineering is delighted to have its graduate program associated with Chris and Susan Burke.\n\"This program has grown in recent years in keeping with the increase in faculty numbers,\" he said. \"We continue to receive ever-increasing number of top applicants to our graduate program from within the U.S. and abroad. This gift will enable us to develop and support new initiatives that enhance graduate student experiences.\"\nThe Burkes' gift will allow the Lyles School of Civil Engineering to set yet another benchmark among the best programs in the world. It is one of the first named graduate programs in a civil engineering program in the U.S.\nThe Burkes are major benefactors and supporters of the Lyles School of Civil Engineering, including the Christopher and Susan Burke Hydraulics and Hydrology Research and Teaching Laboratory, the Christopher and Susan Burke Undergraduate Hydraulics Teaching Laboratory and funding for the Center for UAV Applications for Physical and Environmental Infrastructure.\n• Residential students can get a specialization in one of nine technical concentration areas: Architectural, Construction, Environmental, Geomatics, Geotechnical, Hydraulics and Hydrology, Materials, Structural, Transportation and Infrastructure Systems, as well as a Professional Masters Concentration.\n• Interdisciplinary programs in Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) and Ecological Sciences and Engineering (ESE) are also available for on-campus students.\n• Online students have the opportunity to select coursework from three interdisciplinary tracks: Sustainable Water; Infrastructure, Resiliency and Sustainability; or Smart Mobility.",

Applicants are expected to hold baccalaureate degrees from accredited colleges or universities prior to registration as graduate students. Three-year Bologna bachelor’s degree recipients are eligible for admission.  Applicants with three-year baccalaureate degrees from countries that are not part of the Bologna Process may also be considered for admission, on a case-by-case basis, using a holistic review.  \nApplicants for a master’s or doctoral degree program should have achieved a 3.0 (or equivalent) grade point index or higher from the institution where a baccalaureate degree or higher was awarded to be admitted without conditions of continued enrollment.  Some graduate programs have requirements for admission that exceed the general Office of the Vice Provost for Graduate Students and Postdoctoral Scholars requirements.\nRequirements and application deadlines vary by program. If you have questions about application deadlines or required materials, please contact your program of interest directly, using the phone or email address listed in the requirements pages below.\nSelect a campus\nChoose a location below to see the admissions requirements for each graduate program offered by your chosen campus.\n\n Purdue West Lafayette\n Purdue Fort Wayne\n Purdue Northwest\n\n\nSee the Graduate Degree Programs page for a complete listing of West Lafayette campus degree options and statistics, including enrollment figures, finances, average time to degree, job outcomes, and more.
