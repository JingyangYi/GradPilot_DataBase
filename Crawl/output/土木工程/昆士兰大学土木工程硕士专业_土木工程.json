Knowing the costs and what support is available will help you manage your money.\nBefore you apply for university, there are some costs to consider. These include:\nFor some postgraduate coursework programs you'll pay full tuition fees.\nFor postgraduate domestic students, tuition fees are program-based. This means you'll pay the same tuition fee for each course you study in your program during one academic year.\nTuition fees increase annually. The increase is usually fixed 12 months in advance, so you can plan your finances ahead of time.\nYou can pay these fees upfront or, if you're eligible, defer them through a FEE-HELP loan.\nActual fees may be lower or higher depending on the time you take to complete a program. Fees are reviewed annually and may be higher in later years.\nSome programs also have extra costs for things like equipment or field trips. These costs are listed on the program page.\nMost postgraduate programs at UQ have Commonwealth supported places (CSPs) available for eligible students. A CSP is a place that’s partially funded by the Australian Government.\nThe Government subsidises a CSP by paying part of the fee directly to the university. The subsidy amount isn't a loan – you don’t have to pay this amount back.\nBut you’re required to pay the remainder of the fee, known as the 'student contribution amount', for each course you’re enrolled in. You can pay this fee upfront or, if you're eligible, defer it through a HECS-HELP loan.\nStudents do not need to apply separately for a CSP. Eligible students that submit a completed application by the closing date and meet the program’s entry requirements for the chosen program will automatically be considered for a CSP.\nLearn more about eligibility for CSPs\nThe following postgraduate programs are offered to domestic students on a Commonwealth-supported basis in 2025:\nStudent contributions are reviewed annually and may be higher in later years. Postgraduate programs with CSPs vary from year to year.\nYou can view the fee type for each program under the 'Fees and Scholarships' tab of each program page.\nMost Australian universities charge a compulsory Student Services and Amenities Fee (SSAF).\nThe SSAF is used to fund non-academic services for students, including sports and recreation, employment and career advice, child care and food services.\nThe maximum annual fee is $365 for 2025. This fee increases annually. The amount you have to pay will depend on whether you're an internal or external student, and whether you study full-time or part-time.\nYou can pay this fee upfront or, if you're eligible, defer it through an SA-HELP loan.\nLearn more about the Student Services and Amenities Fee (SSAF)\nUnder certain circumstances, you may have to pay additional administrative fees for things like:\nFor a full list of administrative fees, see our fee schedules.\nThere's a range of other costs you may need to pay for, including accommodation, textbooks and transport.

Our living costs guide can help you budget for common expenses.\nLearn more about the cost of living in Brisbane\nTo help you cover your costs, there's a range of financial support available, including:\nThe Higher Education Loan Program (HELP) offers several schemes to support eligible students with the cost of their education. There are 3 main schemes that support postgraduate students:\nIf you're a full-fee paying student, you may be able to use a FEE-HELP loan to cover your tuition fees.\nYou can apply for FEE-HELP if you are:\nWe'll guide you through how to apply for FEE-HELP once you've accepted an offer to study at UQ.\nThere is a limit to the combined amount you can borrow through HELP loans to cover course fees. This includes HECS-HELP loans incurred from 2020 onwards, and all existing and new FEE-HELP loans.\nIf you're accepted in a Commonwealth Supported Place, you can't use FEE-HELP – you'll need to use HECS-HELP instead.\nLearn more about FEE-HELP\nIf you're enrolled in a Commonwealth Supported Place (CSP), you may be able to use a HECS-HELP loan to cover your student contribution amount.\nTo be eligible for HECS-HELP you must be enrolled in a Commonwealth Supported Place, and be:\nWe'll guide you through how to apply for HECS-HELP once you've accepted an offer to study at UQ.\nLearn more about HECS-HELP\nSA-HELP is a loan scheme that helps students pay their Student Services and Amenities Fee.\nIf you're eligible for HECS-HELP or FEE-HELP, you'll usually also be eligible for SA-HELP. You can use SA-HELP even if you don't take out any other HELP loan.\nWe'll guide you through how to apply for SA-HELP once you've accepted an offer to study at UQ.\nLearn more about SA-HELP\nScholarships can help make your university experience more affordable. We offer more scholarships than any other university in Queensland, so it's worth taking some time to research and apply.\nApplication opening and closing dates vary, so search for scholarships as early as possible to ensure you don't miss application deadlines.\nFind a scholarship\nThe Australian Government has approved some masters programs for Centrelink income support to eligible students. Check the program page under ‘Fees and scholarships’ to find out whether the program you're interested in is approved.\nTuition fees for international students are program-based. This means you'll pay the same tuition fee for each course you study in your program during one academic year.\nTo help you estimate your costs, check our indicative fees. The list shows the average annual cost and estimated total cost of tuition fees for full-time study in each of our programs.\nNon-tuition fees are other fees you may need to pay to UQ. This includes costs like:\nThis can also include costs for any equipment, accommodation or health insurance organised through UQ.\nTo help you estimate your non-tuition fees, check our indicative
