The Australian Government subsidises a Commonwealth supported place by paying part of the fees for the place directly to the university and the student pays the remainder of the fees through a 'student contribution' amount.\nCommonwealth supported places are only available to domestic students. These places are available in all undergraduate courses at UWA and some postgraduate courses.\nTo be eligible for a Commonwealth supported place, you must:\nAustralian citizens and permanent humanitarian visa holders who are enrolled in a Commonwealth supported place can use the HECS-HELP scheme to help them pay their student contributions.\nNew Zealand citizens and permanent visa holders enrolled in a Commonwealth supported place must pay their student contribution upfront to UWA by the census date. If their student contribution amount is left unpaid after the census date then UWA will cancel a student's Commonwealth supported place.\nIf you are not enrolled as a Commonwealth supported student, you will be enrolled as a fee paying student. This means the Government does not subsidise your education and you will need to pay the tuition fees set by UWA. Some fee paying students are eligible for a FEE-HELP loan to pay their tuition fees.\nThe Government administers the Higher Education Loan Programme (HELP) which consists of five HELP loans schemes to assist students with the cost of their fees. The right loan for you will depend on your circumstances, eligibility and where you want to study. For further information please visit StudyAssist : HELP Loans.\nThe Australian Government sets limits on combined HELP loan amount – the cap on what you can borrow from the Australian Government to cover the costs of your tuition fees. Students eligible for HELP can only defer tuition fees up to their combined HELP limit. Students are responsible for managing their HELP usage and must pay upfront any tuition fees that exceed their available HELP balance. Refer to StudyAssist for further details regarding HELP.\nEquivalent full-time student load (EFTSL) is a measure of the study load for a year of a student undertaking a course on a full-time basis.\nThe EFTSL value assigned to each unit of study taken in a course represents the workload in the unit as a proportion of the standard annual workload normally undertaken by a full-time student in that course. These calculations are normally based on the credit point values for coursework degrees. Therefore, a 6 point unit taken in a course for which 48 points constitutes a standard annual workload would be assigned 6/48 = 0.125 EFTSL. The same unit taken in a degree with 50 points in a standard year would be assigned 6/50 = 0.12 EFTSL.\nNew HECS fees for psychology came into place from 2021.\nPsychology is within the Humanities broader discipline and are now HECS band 4 for the majority of students who commence in 2021 onwards.\nThe four courses listed below have been approved at this point in time as pathway programs for psychology, and therefore are eligible for the Australian Government Professional Pathway funding rates (HECS band 2). This means that Commonwealth Supported Place students in the accredited units in these specific courses will receive a discounted rate instead of the full rate displayed in this Fee Calculator.\nEvery non-exempt student enrolled in a Commonwealth supported unit of study must pay the student contribution amount for the unit.\nThis amount depends on the funding cluster to which units of study are allocated.\nUnits of study are allocated to funding clusters according to their discipline under the Australian Standard Classification of Education.\nThe maximum student contribution amounts for a particular year are published by the Department of Education.\nWhen calculating the student contribution amount for a unit, the formula is the student contribution amount for a place set by UWA for the unit multiplied by the EFTSL value of the unit.\nExample: Sandra has enrolled in MATH1001 as part of her Bachelor of Science degree. UWA has set the student contribution amount for a place at $3,985 (the maximum permitted) for that unit of study in 2022. The EFTSL value for MATH1001 is 0.125 EFTSL (6/48). Therefore, Sandra's student contribution amount for MATH1001 will be 3,985 X 0.125 = $498.125\nThe table below shows the student contribution amounts for a student place (EFTSL), by discipline, in 2022:\n1.

Postgraduate Clinical Psychology units of study are in funding cluster 2 and are psychology units of study (FOE code 090701) that contribute to courses of study that are accredited for the purposes of professional registration by the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) and which lead to Endorsed Areas of Practice in Clinical Psychology, Clinical Neuropsychology, Counselling Psychology, Educational and Developmental Psychology, Forensic Psychology, Health Psychology, Sports Psychology and Community Psychology.\n4. Professional Pathway Psychology units of study are Behavioural Science units (with FOE codes starting with 0907) that contribute to courses of study that lead to a bachelor's degree, honours degree or master's degree in psychology with a course structure that makes it compulsory to study the units relevant to professional registration as a psychologist by the Psychology Board of Australia, and which itself represents a pathway to professional registration as a psychologist.\n5. Professional Pathway Social Work units of study are Human Welfare Studies and Services units (with FOE codes starting with 0905) that contribute to courses of study that lead to a bachelor's degree, honours degree or master's degree in:\na.

The same unit taken in a degree with 50 points in a standard year would be assigned 6/50 = 0.12 EFTSL.\n[CARD]\nDomestic Undergraduate and Postgraduate Commonwealth Supported Students\n\nPsychology HECS Fees\nNew HECS fees for psychology came into place from 2021.\nPsychology is within the Humanities broader discipline and are now HECS band 4 for the majority of students who commence in 2021 onwards.\nThe four courses listed below have been approved at this point in time as pathway programs for psychology, and therefore are eligible for the Australian Government Professional Pathway funding rates (HECS band 2). This means that Commonwealth Supported Place students in the accredited units in these specific courses will receive a discounted rate instead of the full rate displayed in this Fee Calculator. \n\nBachelor of Psychology\nBachelor of Psychology (Honours)\nBachelor of Psychology and Bachelor of Arts\nBachelor of Psychology and Bachelor of Commerce \n\n\nEvery non-exempt student enrolled in a Commonwealth supported unit of study must pay the student contribution amount for the unit.\nThis amount depends on the funding cluster to which units of study are allocated.\nUnits of study are allocated to funding clusters according to their discipline under the Australian Standard Classification of Education.\nThe maximum student contribution amounts for a particular year are published by the Department of Education.\nWhen calculating the student contribution amount for a unit, the formula is the student contribution amount for a place set by UWA for the unit multiplied by the EFTSL value of the unit.\nExample: Sandra has enrolled in MATH1001 as part of her Bachelor of Science degree. UWA has set the student contribution amount for a place at $3,985 (the maximum permitted) for that unit of study in 2022. The EFTSL value for MATH1001 is 0.125 EFTSL (6/48). Therefore, Sandra's student contribution amount for MATH1001 will be 3,985 X 0.125 = $498.125\nThe table below shows the student contribution amounts for a student place (EFTSL), by discipline, in 2022:\n\n\nUnit discipline\n2022 annual contribution for a standard (one EFTSL) full-time load (usually 48 credit points)\nApproximate student contribution for a 6 credit point unit (0.125 EFTSL)\n\n\nLaw, Accounting, Commerce, Economics, Administration, Communications, Society and Culture[1]&[2]\n$14,630\n$1,828\n\n\nAgricultureEducation, Postgraduate Clinical Psychology[3], English, Mathematics & StatisticsNursing, Indigenous and Foreign Languages\n$3,985\n$498\n\n\nAllied health, Other health, Built environment, Computing, Visual and Performing Arts,Professional Pathway Psychology[4] and Professional Pathway Social Work[5] Engineering,Science, Surveying, Environmental Studies Pathology\n$8,021\n$1002\n\n\nMedicine, Dentistry, Veterinary Science\n$11,401\n$1,425\n\n\n Notes:\n\n1.

The right loan for you will depend on your circumstances, eligibility and where you want to study. For further information please visit StudyAssist : HELP Loans.\nThe Australian Government sets limits on combined HELP loan amount – the cap on what you can borrow from the Australian Government to cover the costs of your tuition fees. Students eligible for HELP can only defer tuition fees up to their combined HELP limit. Students are responsible for managing their HELP usage and must pay upfront any tuition fees that exceed their available HELP balance.
