In the light of its recent leading-edge research achievements in various areas of forefront technologies in Electrical and Electronic Engineering, the EEE discipline, the Master of Science in Engineering in Electrical and Electronic Engineering [MSc(Eng)(EEE)] curriculum has been significantly updated and improved. The curriculum, based on three subject groups of cutting-edge technologies and management subjects, aims at providing a challenging opportunity for practitioners and industry leaders to refresh their knowledge of EEE, covering theory and practice in advanced topics such as biomedical engineering, computer systems, multimedia systems, networking, power systems, signal processing and wireless communications. Candidates who want updated broad foundation knowledge can pursue the General Stream of study, while candidates who want to specialise may pursue the Communications Engineering Stream or the Power Engineering Stream.Students are required to complete either 48 credits plus a dissertation (equivalent to 24 credits), or 60 credits plus a project (equivalent to 12 credits) to graduate.\n\n\nThree Streams\n1. General2. Communications Engineering3. Power Engineering\n\n\nEntrance Requirements\n\n1. Comply with the University Entrance Requirements; and2. Hold a Bachelor's degree in a relevant field (Engineering or Computer Science) of this University or a comparable institution accepted for this purpose.\n\n\n\nDownload Documents\n\r\n                                        For additional information, we recommend reviewing the following documents:\r\n                                    \n\nAdditional Information\n\nPDF Document\r\n                                        \n\n\nRegulations & Syllabuses\n\nPDF Document\r\n                                        \n\n\nSupporting Documents\n\nPDF Document\r\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFaculty\nFaculty of Engineering\n\r\n                                            The Faculty of Engineering is one of the founding faculties of The University of Hong Kong established in 1912, is among the largest and most comprehensive engineering faculties in Hong Kong.
