Students from over 30 MSc courses will participate, meaning you'll have an excellent opportunity to connect with peers from across the faculty, as part of our ongoing mission to support academic collaboration and social networking among our students.\nThe module begins in September and runs throughout the academic year, concluding in May. It fits flexibly alongside your postgraduate commitments and doesn’t require full-time engagement across the year. Further details on time commitments and session schedules will be provided closer to the start date.\nThe first two weeks are delivered online, meaning you can access them wherever you are. This will be followed by two weeks of in-person sessions on the Leeds campus.\nIf you’re unable to attend from the outset, recordings and materials will be available through the module’s online learning platform so that you can catch up at your convenience.\nFull module details, including schedules, session formats, and assessment guidance, will be published on the module page; you’ll be given all updates through your University email address.\nAny more questions? Please get in touch with University’s Language Centre at languagecentremass@leeds.ac.uk.\n• Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences\n• Your guide to the Professional and Academic Communication module\n• Whether English is your first language or an additional one, this module gives you the skills to engage confidently and precisely with peers, academics, and professionals in your discipline.\n• We’ll help you explore and practise the use of subject-specific vocabulary to make you more confident with key terminology.\n• The module also introduces essential tools and strategies, including AI, letting you make informed decisions about how and when to use them effectively.\n• You’ll also explore and develop techniques to help your day-to-day interactions with peers, lecturers, and wider University staff, supporting your learning.\n• The module is led by expert staff from the University's Language Centre, who specialise in teaching academic English at postgraduate level.\n• It has been developed in collaboration with subject-specific academics to ensure relevance to your area of study.\n• You’ll receive structured guidance throughout, with a particular emphasis on directly applying what you learn to your own Masters study.\n• This module is not compulsory, but you will be automatically enrolled, and participation is strongly recommended. We believe that students completing the module will feel better prepared for the demands of postgraduate study.\n• If you wish to opt out, a form will be made available closer to the start date.\n• Assessment will be via a portfolio, designed to help you reflect on your progress and demonstrate the communication skills you have developed. Detailed guidance will be provided at the beginning of the module, and we’ll make support available to you throughout the year.\n• Most importantly, the module won’t impact your final Masters classification.\n• No tuition fees are associated with this module, as participation is fully funded as part of your course.\n• Specific timings for live sessions will be shared when the module timetable is finalised.",

However, courses, University services and content of publications remain subject to change.\nChanges may be necessary to comply with the requirements of accrediting bodies or to keep courses contemporary through updating practices or areas of study.\nCircumstances may arise outside the reasonable control of the University leading to required changes. Such circumstances include industrial action, unexpected student numbers, significant staff illness (where a course is reliant upon a person's expertise), unexpected lack of funding, severe weather, fire, civil disorder, political unrest, government restrictions and serious concern with regard to the transmission of serious illness making a course unsafe to deliver.\nAfter a student has taken up a place with the University, the University will look to give early notification of any changes and try to minimise their impact, offering suitable alternative arrangements or forms of compensation where it believes there is a fair case to do so.\nUnless otherwise stated, 'on-campus' courses will be delivered at the Leeds campus of the University.\nThe latest key information on courses, entry requirements and fees can be found at courses.leeds.ac.uk.

We aim to reduce climate change and improve resilience of the built environment and city infrastructure through multi and transdisciplinary studies. We bring innovations in low carbon and circular built environment, while seeking to ensure the health and wellbeing of occupants. We increase capacity of infrastructure systems to mitigate and adapt to future climate changes and develop managerial solutions to deliver these innovations.\nWe deliver our projects with strong national and international collaborations. Our topics covers the following strands:\nArchitecture and Architectural engineering play a key role in achieving the sustainable development of our built-environment. Our research takes multi-disciplinary approaches to sustainable buildings, low carbon design, low impact materials and waste minimization, relationships between occupant behaviours, health, wellbeing and building performance. We contribute to the climate emergency by developing award winning technical innovations in low carbon construction systems coupling efficiency, resiliency, design for deconstruction and reuse, and advanced/ robotic manufacturing.\nWe also approach architecture and urbanism with multiple theoretical and empirical discourses to create impact and knowledge on design and practice, and communities within the Global South. We are particularly interested in using the arts and humanities methodologies to unfold complex topics on urban and digital heritage, Participatory Action Research (PAR), co-production processes, socio-spatial studies, memory, culture, preservation, regeneration, digital mapping and living labs.\nA circular economy is crucial for sustainable development. It includes efforts to minimise resource use, prevent waste and optimise the social, environmental, technical and economic values of products, components and materials throughout their consecutive lifecycles. Circular economy involves design for reduced resource balanced with durability, modular design that enables the repairing, reusing, repurposing and remanufacturing of components and high quality recycling.\nCivil Engineering is home to world leading inter and transdisciplinary research to support the implementation of a sustainable circular economy, in the areas of architecture and construction materials, water and waste management, and energy infrastructure, and cross-cutting areas such as governance, project management, business model innovation and whole system assessment. Please find a full overview of circular economy research at the University of Leeds on the Yorkshire Circular Lab website.\nProviding clean renewable energy is a key priority for tackling climate change and achieving net zero emissions. The school of civil engineering conducts world-leading multi-disciplinary research in both provision of energy and infrastructure for energy supply. In the field of energy geotechnics we work across geology, geotechnical engineering, building services engineering and policy, including on how we can use the ground and buried civil engineering structures for thermal energy provision, the use of ground source heat pumps and district heating, and how we can safely store nuclear waste and carbon dioxide within the ground.\nResearch also tackles the challenge of how we can produce energy vectors like biomethane and biohydrogen from products of wastewater treatment or agricultural and food industry waste, how we can improve the circularity of wind energy generation, and the provision of innovative business models and contractual arrangements to facilitate the deployment of energy infrastructure, such as small modular nuclear reactors and energy storage systems.\nWe develop solutions for ever-growing challenges in society, as projects become more prevalent organisational forms. Projects, as key vehicles to address the UN Sustainable Development Goals, deliver infrastructure and change across the world. We are interested in improving the management and delivery of projects with particular focus on complex major infrastructure projects across their lifecycles, from concept through to decommissioning.\nWe have particular expertise in sustainable interventions, governance, project leadership and behaviour, and project economics and legalities. Our work is used by organisations such as the Association for Project Management, the Nuclear Decommissioning Agency and international corporations.\nPlease read our Leeds Centre for Projects (LCP) page for more information.\nUrban infrastructure is the nexus of our lives on this planet, and the current Climate Crisis is demanding more and more from these spaces in terms of mitigating their impacts on the environment – sustainability, and their ability to adapt/absorb future change – resilience. The school of Civil Engineering conducts world leading research in development and management of infrastructure systems, with particular emphasis on railway engineering systems with Institute for High Speed Rail and System Integration, transport behaviour in urban areas, infrastructure robotics and infrastructure adaptation to future flood risk (from strategy to assessment). We use interdisciplinary approaches to develop technical and end-user focused research to ensure future urban environments are safe, sustainable, and resilient for future generations.\nWe have a strong interdisciplinary funding portfolio that reflects collaborations across a wide range of disciplines and currently have over £20m of UKRI (EPSRC, ESRC, British Academy, AHRC, Innovate UK), EU and industrial funding. Our research has impact on a national and international scale through collaborations with numerous partners in academia, industry, government, professional bodies and NGOs in the UK, Europe, and the Global South.\nView all members of our research group, our recent projects and publications.\nWe have opportunities for prospective postgraduate researchers. Find out more.\nInformal enquiries regarding postgraduate research can be made to the group leader, or any member of staff working in a relevant area.\nIf you would like to discuss an area of research in more detail, please contact Dr Ornella Iuorio.\n• Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences\n• School of Civil Engineering\n• Research and innovation\n• Cities, Infrastructure and Energy",

We aim to preserve and develop safe, sustainable, durable and resilient infrastructure now and in the future. Our research agendas are developed in consideration of the most pressing national and global challenges posed by climate change and performance demands in our built environment.\nWe deliver multi-scale and multi-disciplinary research projects, conducted across the University and with national and global partners. Our work covers a broad range of topics, including:\nOur research centres on the development, characterisation and exploitation of Portland and non-Portland cement and concrete technologies, from materials selection and mix designs optimisation, to evaluation of their durability performance when exposed to different environments. Our activities are developed in partnership with the Neville Centre of Excellence in Cement and Concrete Engineering.\nWe work in a broad range of low carbon materials for the production of concrete including composite and alkali-activated cements, alternative supplementary cementitious materials, recycled aggregates, and fibre reinforced systems, among others. It complemented by the implementation of thermodynamic, structural mechanics and fluid dynamic modelling approaches. Learn more by viewing The Concrete Set and Making Concrete Greener and Going with the Flow: the Hidden Science of Fluid Dynamics.\nOur research aims to advance the underpinning understanding needed to develop best practices and strategies for the maintenance, repair and rehabilitation of masonry infrastructure. We perform large scale experimental testing and advance computational approaches for developing models to predict the post-cracking and near collapse nature of masonry subjected to various types of loading, including simulations of natural disasters. It also includes the structural analysis and modelling of complexity in geometry of masonry infrastructures, and determining soil-structure interaction and its influence in deterioration mechanisms.\nOur research centres on the development of innovative steel, steel-concrete composite, and hybrid structural members and systems for embracing resilience and sustainability. It integrates simulation-based engineering science combined with large and full-scale experimental methods for optimising structural and material performance. Current topics include: structural topology optimisation for reducing material use, connection, panel and slab design for offsite or modular building construction, and design for additive manufacturing.\nOur research aims to identify the as-built properties and the aged state of current structural systems providing confidence in them, and ultimately enabling least-assumptive, data-driven, accurate long-term life predictions that safeguard society from the multiplicative impact imposed by structural failures. To achieve such knowledge we develop and best employ state-of-the-art sensors and instrumentation, such as digital image correlation, hyperspectral imaging, ultrasonic pulse velocimetry, accelerometery, and laser vibrometry. We also employ non-destructive structural identification techniques, and novel applications in robotics and autonomous systems.\nOur research centres on identifying the most suitable solutions to enable decarbonisation of the construction sector. Our commitment and motivation to contribute to minimising the environmental footprint of infrastructure is at the heart of all the research topics of our group. As key technical contributors of ongoing national efforts in circular economy and resource recovery from waste, our research includes materials flow analysis, environmental and social life-cycle analysis of materials and systems, socio-economic impact modelling, and others.\nThis research is developed in collaboration with the Cities, Infrastructure and Energy research group, specifically with colleagues from the Project Management and Sustainable and Resilient Infrastructure teams.\nWorking at the interface between architecture and structural engineering, our ongoing research focuses on understanding the relationship between form and forces for design and structural optimisation. We explore the opportunities offered by computational tools, advanced manufacturing and robotics in creating innovative and resilient structural systems. These activities are conducted in close collaboration with the Cities, Infrastructure and Energy research group.\nWe enjoy state of the art facilities housed at the School of Civil Engineering including the UKCRIC Centre for Infrastructure Materials, Solid Waste Management and Sample Preparation Laboratory, and the George Earle Heavy Structures Laboratory, with specialised rigs for full-scale performance testing of structures, fatigue, long-term loading effects (creep), as well as a dedicated concrete casting shop and an environmentally controlled curing room.\nView all members of our research group, our recent projects and publications.\nWe have opportunities for prospective postgraduate researchers. Find out more.\nIf you would like to discuss an area of research in more detail, please contact Professor Susan Bernal.\n• Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences\n• School of Civil Engineering\n• Research and innovation\n• Materials and Structures",

Visit Course Search to find the fees for your course.\nPostgraduate fees are not regulated by the UK government so decisions on UK undergraduate fees do not apply to postgraduate fees. Our postgraduate fees are set independently and reviewed on an annual basis.\nFind out when to pay your fees and the payment options we offer.\nIf you are a Masters applicant to Leeds who needs a Student visa to study in the UK, you will need to pay a tuition fee deposit.\nIf you are a former student of the University of Leeds you may be eligible for a 10% alumni tuition fee bursary.\nIf you are studying part-time, the full-time fee is generally split so payment is divided equally across each year of study. For example if your part-time course is two years long you will pay half each year. However, this is not always the case so please check with the admission team for your course.\nIf your course is 100% online, you may be able to pay on a module-by-module basis. Please check with the admissions tutor for your chosen course - contact details are listed for each course.\nThe majority of part-time postgraduate Masters fees are fixed at the point of entry and will not rise in subsequent years of the course. This means you can more easily plan your finances at the outset.\nYou are classified as either a \"home\" or \"international\" student for the purpose of assessing tuition fees. Only certain categories of students will be charged the \"home\" tuition fee. Where it is not clear from your application form whether you have \"home\" or \"international\" status, we will carry out a fees assessment. For further information and advice, you can consult the UK Council for International Student Affairs (UKCISA).\nThe information provided is for general guidance purposes only. The University believes the information provided is accurate at the time of publication. The University cannot accept liability for any inaccuracies.\nYou need to make arrangements to pay your tuition fees before the start of the academic year or you won't be able to register. Find out more about how to pay your tuition fees on our website For Students.\nYou become liable to pay tuition fees when you register on your course. If you leave before the end of your course, we calculate your fees based on your leaving date. Read more about tuition fee liability on our website For Students.\nIf you have a question about fee payment contact the Student Fees team:\nIf you are supported by your government, employer, or other sponsor, you should provide a letter from them addressed to the University, confirming that the fees will be paid directly. Sponsors cannot pay by instalments.\nFor more detail, see our information for sponsored students on our For Students website.\n• Phone the Student Fees team:  0113 343 6700\n• Email the Student fees team: pgfees@leeds.ac.uk",
