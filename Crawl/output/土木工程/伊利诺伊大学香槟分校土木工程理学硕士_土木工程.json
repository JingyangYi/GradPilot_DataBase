If you still have questions, please see the contact information at the bottom of the page. The Graduate College at Illinois also provides a list of Frequently Asked Questions and answers about the graduate application process. These can be found here: Graduate College FAQs.\nWhat are the application deadlines?\nThe deadlines for our Graduate Programs are listed on our Information and Deadlines page.\nCan I be considered for an application fee waiver?\nInternational applicants are not eligible for an application fee waiver unless coming under a valid exchange agreement that has an approved application fee waiver. Domestic applicants may be eligible for one of the approved application fee waivers.\nHow do I know if I am qualified for admission and CEE funding?\nCompetition for the available research assistant positions is often extremely steep. We consider many factors in evaluating candidates for admission and CEE funding, including academic record, research and employment experience, research interests, standardized test scores, and reference letters. For this reason, we cannot evaluate your chances of receiving admission and CEE funding until we receive your application.\nWhen will I receive an admission decision on my application?\nAdmission decisions are made and reported to the applicant during the following dates:\n• Spring semesters: between September 15 - November 1\n• Fall semesters: between February 15 - May 1\nHow can I be considered for funding?\nSubmitting an application for admission places you in the candidate pool for consideration for all fellowships administered by the Graduate College, along with fellowships and assistantships offered within the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. The application includes basic information about you as a candidate, your personal statement, three letters of reference, and transcripts. No additional application is necessary. With regard to CEE funding, the number of applicants far exceeds the amount of funding that we have available. Only the most talented applicants who match the research needs of our professors receive funding from CEE. The selection process is difficult, and we are able to give funding to only a small number of applicants. For information about external fellowships, please see the Graduate College's External Fellowship information and Database.\nHow long should my statement of purpose be and what should it say?\nYour statement of purpose should be 1-2 pages, single spaced, 12 pt. font. It should not exceed two pages. Your statement should identify personal, professional, and academic goals. You should also discuss your development and plans as they relate to graduate study. It is good to include any past work history, your interests, and reasons for pursuing a graduate degree in CEE. Your statement should offer insight into who you are as an individual.\nDo I need to answer a program specific question for CEE?\nNo. CEE does not have a program specific question.\nI applied for a past term, but my admission was not approved. How can I be considered again?\nYou must submit a new application and pay the application fee again. Do not use the previous PIN, but instead choose \"Create Account\" on the login page. You will need to upload transcripts, a statement of purpose, and a new resume. We may be able to use past reference letters that are dated no more than one year ago. Contact grad@illinois.edu if you wish to use reference letters from a previous application. If your test scores are still valid, they will still be in our data system.\nHave you received my letters, transcripts, or test scores yet?\nSoon after you submit your application, an email will be sent to you to confirm that CEE has received your application. The message will include a link to a web page where you can check the status of your application; the Student Status Page. Here you will be able to see if we have received your letters, transcripts, and test scores. Due to the volume of applications received, our office will not be able to check for individual documents. Please allow at least 4 weeks for your test scores to be marked as received. It always takes longer than expected for the test scores to make it into the university database.\nWill the department notify me of missing application materials?\nThe CEE Department will not send individual reminders on missing materials. Please check on your Student Status Page to make sure all of your application materials have been submitted.\nDo I need to submit official transcripts? I have already attached scanned copies of my transcripts to the application.\nOfficial transcripts are not required for the initial application review process.

Applicants recommended for admission will be required to submit their official transcripts directly to the Graduate College.\nWhere do I submit my final, official transcripts?\nIf you are an admitted student, please send your official transcripts directly to the University of Illinois Graduate College.\nMailing address:\nThe Graduate College Admissions Office University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign 507 E. Green Street, Suite 101 Champaign, IL 61820\nCan I make changes to my list of reference letter writers?\nYes, you can edit a reference by going back into your Student Status Page.\nCan my reference letters be mailed or emailed?\nIndividuals writing letters of recommendation on your behalf should submit their letters through the online application system. Any recommendation letters that are not submitted through the online application system will impact timely processing of your application.\nMay I submit more than three reference letters?\nYes, but it is not necessary. You should pick your three best recommenders. If possible, your letters should be from past instructors, professors or advisors. If you have been away from academics for a significant amount of time, you may use non-academic references (i.e., supervisor, colleagues, etc.).\nMy recommender(s) are unable to submit letters by the deadline. Can you make an exception to the deadline?\nAll application materials must be submitted by the deadline. Late letters will be added to your application; however, we cannot guarantee that the admission committee will review late letters. You have the option of asking another recommender to write a letter by the deadline by going into your application portal and adding a recommender.\nDoes CEE require GRE scores?\nGRE test scores are currently optional for all CEE graduate school applicants. However, it is strongly recommended that the GRE test be submitted to help faculty with admission and funding decisions for all Ph.D. applicants. CEE also recommends the GRE test for M.S. applications, particularly for students applying from international universities, M.S. applicants looking for potential funding support, or M.S. applicants whose GPA falls below the average GPA of admitted students.\nIf GRE scores are submitted, CEE does not have minimum scores for admission.

After you take the GRE, please upload your unofficial scores to your application and make sure you have ordered an official copy to be sent to the University of Illinois using institution code 1836.

As long as the institution code is correct, any and all departments will be able to view your test scores.\nYou do not need to report official IELTS scores, only the unofficial copy is required with your application.

When will the exam scores show as received?\nIt can take more than four weeks from the time you order the scores to be received at the university and matched up with your application. Due to the high volume of application material processed, we are unable to check on the status of scores being submitted. You may upload a scanned PDF copy of the full official score report to your application as \"supplemental material\" until official scores are received, however your application will not be considered complete until all official scores have been received.\nWhat are the English language proficiency requirements for admission to the Graduate College and Civil and Environmental Engineering department?\nPlease see the Graduate College's English Proficiency Requirements for details. This page also provides information about two exemptions to the language proficiency requirements.\nThe medium of instruction in my country is English. Do I need to submit TOEFL or IELTS language proficiency scores to be admitted to the CEE graduate program?\nPlease check the Graduate College’s admission requirements by country to see if your country is exempted for admission purposes.
