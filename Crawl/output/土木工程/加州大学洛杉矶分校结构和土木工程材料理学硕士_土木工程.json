To do so, students must submit an online application for the updated term. Be sure to select “renewal” as the application type instead of “new”. Updating an application will require re-uploading transcripts. Students must apply by the application deadline for the new term. Please note that after updating the application, admission is not guaranteed.\nRegistration and Orientation During the Summer prior to your Fall start term you will receive communication from Annie Lee, the Civil and Environmental Engineering Student Affairs Officer (ceesao@seas.ucla.edu). After you submit your SIR you should have access to update your contact information in MyUCLA. Please make sure the email account we have on file will be valid through the summer and does not send emails received from ceesao@seas.ucla.edu to junk/spam. You may also want to review the Student Checklists, including the New Student Checklist under the Graduate Student Forms section of our department website.\nThe admission committee conducts a comprehensive and thorough review of each application. We are unable to offer specific reasons for denial. Admission to UCLA, particularly to our department, is extremely competitive, and qualified applications outnumber available spots for students.\nCan I apply for a spring or winter term? Applicants are strongly encouraged to apply for the fall term. Arriving in Winter or Spring may prevent a student from taking courses that have pre-requisites only offered in the fall term.\nWhat are the minimum GPA and GRE requirements for admission? Our programs require a Bachelor’s degree from a regionally accredited institution, comparable in standard to a Bachelor’s degree from the University of California. In general, successful applicants have demonstrated outstanding quantitative ability and proven success in previous academic endeavors, particularly coursework relevant to their intended major. Applicants to our M.S. programs are expected to hold a Bachelor’s degree with a minimum grade point average of 3.0 or equivalent. Applicants to our Ph.D. programs should have completed a Master’s degree program with a 3.25 minimum grade point average, and hold a Bachelor’s degree with a 3.0 minimum grade point average (or equivalent). We do not have a minimum GRE score requirement for admission. We conduct a comprehensive and thorough review of applications and consider many factors when issuing an admission decision.\nCan I apply if I do not have an undergraduate degree in Civil and Environmental Engineering? In rare circumstances, applicants without an undergraduate degree in Civil and Environmental Engineering may be admitted to our graduate programs. Typically these applicants have related degrees who have completed requisite coursework. For example, an Environmental Science undergraduate major applying to our Environmental and Water Resources Engineering graduate program who has also completed requisites for the graduate degree.  We encourage applicants to complete requisite coursework for their intended graduate degree program prior to applying. Requisite requirements may be found in our Program Requirements. Course descriptions may be found in the Catalog.\nCan I apply for a M.S. program if I already have a M.S. degree? The University of California, in general discourages the duplication of advanced degrees. All applicants for a second academic graduate degree at the same level as, or at a lower level than the graduate degree they already hold, will be required to show compelling cause to the department before it reviews and recommends admission to the Dean of the Graduate Division. If admitted for a second graduate degree, students will be held to all the usual degree requirements and University regulations pertaining to fees, registrations, examinations, advancement to candidacy, residency, etc. Courses already applied to any earlier graduate degree cannot be applied to the second degree.\nI am a current M.S./Ph.D. student. Can I transfer to your institution? We do not have a separate transfer admission process at the graduate level. All applicants submit the same graduate application. M.S. applicants should also refer to the M.S. transfer coursework policy by reviewing the Standards and Procedures for Graduate Study at UCLA.\nI have already taken some graduate level coursework. Will I be able to transfer the coursework if admitted to the M.S. program? M.S. applicants should refer to the M.S. transfer coursework policy by reviewing the Standards and Procedures for Graduate Study at UCLA. Through petition, courses completed in graduate status on other UC campuses may apply to master’s programs at UCLA, provided they were not used toward a previous degree. Such courses may fulfill up to one-half of the total course requirement, one-half of the graduate course requirement, and one-third of the academic residence requirement. A maximum of two courses completed with a minimum grade of ‘B’ in graduate status at institutions other than UC may apply to UCLA master’s programs. Two courses would be the equivalent of eight quarter units or five semester units. They may not fulfill the minimum five-graduate-course requirement or the academic residence requirement. The approval of the Graduate Division and the student’s major department is required on a petition for transfer of credit. Courses taken for any other degree previously awarded at UCLA or another institution, and courses taken before the award of the bachelor’s degree may not be applied toward a graduate degree at UCLA.\nWhat if my GRE or TOEFL/IELTS scores arrive after the application deadline? Official test scores must be received by the deadline. If materials are received after the deadline your application will be considered late. Late application may experience a delay in processing and you may not be considered for university and/or departmental funding opportunities. We will do our best to review late applications, but cannot guarantee we will be able to review for the intended application term. It is recommended that you submit all other materials prior the application deadline and your test scores will be added to your application when they are received.\nCan I submit test scores (GRE and/or TOEFL/IELTS) prior to the application deadline and submit new scores after the application deadline? What about submitting other updated application materials after the deadline?\nWe will consider all scores submitted to the university. However, we cannot guarantee that a decision will not be made prior to the receipt of materials, including test scores, received after the application deadline.\nAm I eligible for a TOEFL/IELTS waiver? The UCLA Graduate Division English Requirement website provides an extensive explanation of who is required to submit a TOEFL/IELTS as well as exemptions.\nHow do I apply for departmental funding? The Civil and Environmental Engineering department does not have a separate application process to be considered for funding. All applicants are automatically considered for departmental funding including Teaching Assistantships, Research Assistantships, and departmental fellowships. In addition, the online application has a section labeled “Fellowship Application” where you may select to be considered for UCLA Graduate Division Fellowships. Please be sure to visit the Graduate Division website to learn more about those fellowship opportunities. Applicants are also strongly encouraged to apply for University and external funding opportunities. More information on funding is located on the UCLA Graduate Division’s funding website. While all applicants are considered for funding, most funding opportunities are awarded to PhD applicants.\nHow long does it take to earn a MS degree? Most of our students complete the MS Civil and Environmental Engineering program in one year. The Civil and Environmental Engineering MS program of study consists of at least nine graduate and upper division courses completed while in graduate status. Typically, students take three of the nine required courses every quarter.\nHow long does it take to earn a PhD degree? Most students complete the Ph.D. Civil and Environmental Engineering program in 4 – 6 years. Applicants who are admitted into the PhD and do not hold a MS are required to complete and earn a MS degree within the first two years (6 quarters) of enrollment with UCLA. These students would then be expected to complete and earn the PhD within 5 years (15 quarters) of earning the MS. Applicants who are admitted into the PhD and hold a MS are expected to complete and earn the PhD within 5 years (15 quarters) of earning the MS.\nUCLA Graduate Application\nUCLA Graduate Division Graduate Admission\nUCLA General Catalog\nUCLA Registrar\nInternational Student Requirements\nCivil and Environmental Engineering Program Requirements\nEmail: ceeapply@seas.ucla.edu\nMailing Address for Application Documents:\nUCLA Civil & Environmental Engineering, Attn: Admission580 Portola Plaza 5731 Boelter HallLos Angeles, CA 90095-1593\nESAP recognizes outstanding UCLA School of Engineering and Applied Sciences undergraduate students who wish to enter the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences graduate program upon completion of the Bachelor’s degree.

If admitted, the conditions of admission and information and instructions concerning registration (via a link to the Statement of Intent to Register and a Statement of Legal Residence) will be included as part of the admission letter, which can be printed out from the Graduate Division site. Admission letters are only available electronically and are not mailed to applicants.\nAdmitted Students\nSubmitting the Statement of Intent to Register If you receive an offer of admission, please inform us of your intention to attend UCLA, regardless of if you accept or decline. If you accept our offer, you will begin receiving information about registration, orientation, and if you are an international student, I-20s.\nInternational Students: \nYou may be prompted to enter dates of attendance when submitting the SIR/SLR. MS students should enter “September 23, 2024 – June 12, 2026.” PhD students should enter “September 23, 2024 – June 15, 2029.” See the Annual Academic Calendar to view other instruction start and end dates.\nReceiving your I-20 (International Students) If you are an international student, then if you accept our offer, you will receive communication from the UCLA Dashew Center for International Students & Scholars with information on how to request an I-20. Once your I-20 is ready, we will be notified and will email you to confirm your personal information, mailing information, and shipping options.\nSubmitting Final Transcripts We prefer submission of final transcripts electronically. Please have your institution’s Registrar submit your official final transcript + degree certificate/diploma (if applicable) electronically to ceeapply@seas.ucla.edu. If you prefer to submit official transcripts + degree certificate/diploma by mail, it must be issued by your institution in a sealed envelope. Either you or your institution may directly send your official transcripts to us.\nIf necessary, you may drop off your final official transcripts and degree certificates/diploma in Boelter Hall 5732-A when you arrive on campus. However, it is preferred that final transcripts and degree certificates/diploma are sent to our office as soon as your degree has been conferred. You will have a hold on your account until all necessary documents have been received.\nPlease send documents to the following address:\nUCLA Civil & Environmental Engineering Attn: Admission; Final Transcripts580 Portola Plaza 5731 Boelter HallLos Angeles, CA 90095-1593\nInternational Students:\nPlease read the Graduate Division’s Required Academic Records information prior to submitting your transcripts. Please note that both the original language and English translations of your degree certificates and diplomas must be submitted.\nUCLA Undergraduate Students:\nSince we have access to your records, you will not need to submit a final transcript.\nReviewing Conditions of Admission Students may review the conditions of admission through their ‘Graduate Admission Checklist.’ Conditions may include, but are not limited to submitting final transcripts, attending provisional quarters, and taking the English as a Second Language Placement Examination (ESLPE).\nUpdating your Application Admitted students can update their application for up to one year without having to pay the application fee again. To do so, students must submit an online application for the updated term. Be sure to select “renewal” as the application type instead of “new”. Updating an application will require re-uploading transcripts. Students must apply by the application deadline for the new term. Please note that after updating the application, admission is not guaranteed.\nRegistration and Orientation During the Summer prior to your Fall start term you will receive communication from Annie Lee, the Civil and Environmental Engineering Student Affairs Officer (ceesao@seas.ucla.edu). After you submit your SIR you should have access to update your contact information in MyUCLA. Please make sure the email account we have on file will be valid through the summer and does not send emails received from ceesao@seas.ucla.edu to junk/spam. You may also want to review the Student Checklists, including the New Student Checklist under the Graduate Student Forms section of our department website.\nDenied Students\nThe admission committee conducts a comprehensive and thorough review of each application. We are unable to offer specific reasons for denial. Admission to UCLA, particularly to our department, is extremely competitive, and qualified applications outnumber available spots for students.\n\nCan I apply for a spring or winter term? Applicants are strongly encouraged to apply for the fall term. Arriving in Winter or Spring may prevent a student from taking courses that have pre-requisites only offered in the fall term.\nWhat are the minimum GPA and GRE requirements for admission? Our programs require a Bachelor’s degree from a regionally accredited institution, comparable in standard to a Bachelor’s degree from the University of California. In general, successful applicants have demonstrated outstanding quantitative ability and proven success in previous academic endeavors, particularly coursework relevant to their intended major. Applicants to our M.S. programs are expected to hold a Bachelor’s degree with a minimum grade point average of 3.0 or equivalent. Applicants to our Ph.D. programs should have completed a Master’s degree program with a 3.25 minimum grade point average, and hold a Bachelor’s degree with a 3.0 minimum grade point average (or equivalent). We do not have a minimum GRE score requirement for admission. We conduct a comprehensive and thorough review of applications and consider many factors when issuing an admission decision.\nCan I apply if I do not have an undergraduate degree in Civil and Environmental Engineering? In rare circumstances, applicants without an undergraduate degree in Civil and Environmental Engineering may be admitted to our graduate programs. Typically these applicants have related degrees who have completed requisite coursework. For example, an Environmental Science undergraduate major applying to our Environmental and Water Resources Engineering graduate program who has also completed requisites for the graduate degree.  We encourage applicants to complete requisite coursework for their intended graduate degree program prior to applying. Requisite requirements may be found in our Program Requirements. Course descriptions may be found in the Catalog.\nCan I apply for a M.S. program if I already have a M.S. degree? The University of California, in general discourages the duplication of advanced degrees. All applicants for a second academic graduate degree at the same level as, or at a lower level than the graduate degree they already hold, will be required to show compelling cause to the department before it reviews and recommends admission to the Dean of the Graduate Division. If admitted for a second graduate degree, students will be held to all the usual degree requirements and University regulations pertaining to fees, registrations, examinations, advancement to candidacy, residency, etc. Courses already applied to any earlier graduate degree cannot be applied to the second degree.\nI am a current M.S./Ph.D. student. Can I transfer to your institution? We do not have a separate transfer admission process at the graduate level. All applicants submit the same graduate application. M.S. applicants should also refer to the M.S. transfer coursework policy by reviewing the Standards and Procedures for Graduate Study at UCLA.\nI have already taken some graduate level coursework. Will I be able to transfer the coursework if admitted to the M.S. program? M.S. applicants should refer to the M.S. transfer coursework policy by reviewing the Standards and Procedures for Graduate Study at UCLA. Through petition, courses completed in graduate status on other UC campuses may apply to master’s programs at UCLA, provided they were not used toward a previous degree. Such courses may fulfill up to one-half of the total course requirement, one-half of the graduate course requirement, and one-third of the academic residence requirement. A maximum of two courses completed with a minimum grade of ‘B’ in graduate status at institutions other than UC may apply to UCLA master’s programs. Two courses would be the equivalent of eight quarter units or five semester units. They may not fulfill the minimum five-graduate-course requirement or the academic residence requirement. The approval of the Graduate Division and the student’s major department is required on a petition for transfer of credit. Courses taken for any other degree previously awarded at UCLA or another institution, and courses taken before the award of the bachelor’s degree may not be applied toward a graduate degree at UCLA.\nWhat if my GRE or TOEFL/IELTS scores arrive after the application deadline? Official test scores must be received by the deadline. If materials are received after the deadline your application will be considered late. Late application may experience a delay in processing and you may not be considered for university and/or departmental funding opportunities. We will do our best to review late applications, but cannot guarantee we will be able to review for the intended application term. It is recommended that you submit all other materials prior the application deadline and your test scores will be added to your application when they are received.\nCan I submit test scores (GRE and/or TOEFL/IELTS) prior to the application deadline and submit new scores after the application deadline? What about submitting other updated application materials after the deadline? \nWe will consider all scores submitted to the university. However, we cannot guarantee that a decision will not be made prior to the receipt of materials, including test scores, received after the application deadline.\nAm I eligible for a TOEFL/IELTS waiver? The UCLA Graduate Division English Requirement website provides an extensive explanation of who is required to submit a TOEFL/IELTS as well as exemptions.\nHow do I apply for departmental funding? The Civil and Environmental Engineering department does not have a separate application process to be considered for funding. All applicants are automatically considered for departmental funding including Teaching Assistantships, Research Assistantships, and departmental fellowships. In addition, the online application has a section labeled “Fellowship Application” where you may select to be considered for UCLA Graduate Division Fellowships. Please be sure to visit the Graduate Division website to learn more about those fellowship opportunities. Applicants are also strongly encouraged to apply for University and external funding opportunities. More information on funding is located on the UCLA Graduate Division’s funding website. While all applicants are considered for funding, most funding opportunities are awarded to PhD applicants.\nHow long does it take to earn a MS degree? Most of our students complete the MS Civil and Environmental Engineering program in one year. The Civil and Environmental Engineering MS program of study consists of at least nine graduate and upper division courses completed while in graduate status. Typically, students take three of the nine required courses every quarter.\nHow long does it take to earn a PhD degree? Most students complete the Ph.D. Civil and Environmental Engineering program in 4 – 6 years. Applicants who are admitted into the PhD and do not hold a MS are required to complete and earn a MS degree within the first two years (6 quarters) of enrollment with UCLA. These students would then be expected to complete and earn the PhD within 5 years (15 quarters) of earning the MS. Applicants who are admitted into the PhD and hold a MS are expected to complete and earn the PhD within 5 years (15 quarters) of earning the MS.\n\nUCLA Graduate Application        \n\nYou may begin your application, save, and return to make updates before submitting.\nApplication deadline is in December for the fall term.\n\nUCLA Graduate Division Graduate Admission\n\nUniversity application requirements and criteria for admission\nApplication fee information\nInternational Applicant Information\n\nUCLA General Catalog\n\nCivil and Environmental Engineering department overview\nCivil and Environmental Engineering course descriptions\n\nUCLA Registrar\n\nTuition and Fee information\nAcademic calendar\n\nInternational Student Requirements\n\nDetailed information about required academic records\nEnglish language requirements\n\nCivil and Environmental Engineering Program Requirements\n\nM.S. and Ph.D. program overview\nRequisite information\n\n\nEmail: ceeapply@seas.ucla.edu\nMailing Address for Application Documents:\nUCLA Civil & Environmental Engineering, Attn: Admission580 Portola Plaza 5731 Boelter HallLos Angeles, CA 90095-1593\n\nUCLA Exceptional Student Admissions Program (ESAP)\nOverview\nESAP recognizes outstanding UCLA School of Engineering and Applied Sciences undergraduate students who wish to enter the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences graduate program upon completion of the Bachelor’s degree. ESAP students are genuine graduate students who are eligible for graduate fellowships and funding.\nEligibility\nPlease refer to the UCLA Engineering Office of Academic and Student Affairs website for ESAP eligibility. Students who meet the eligibility requirements will receive a formal notice via email informing them of their eligibility. The Civil and Environmental Engineering department will also receive notification. To maintain eligibility, students must continue to achieve the specified GPA and successfully complete the Bachelor’s degree. All ESAP students must complete the regular graduate admission application and meet the application deadline.\nBenefits\nAdmission is guaranteed to the graduate program in the department in which the student earned a Bachelor’s degree for the time period specified in the ESAP letter. Civil and Environmental Engineering undergraduate students are guaranteed admission to the M.S. Civil Engineering program for three academic quarters after earning the undergraduate degree. Because our M.S. program only offers a fall intake, students should plan to apply to the graduate program during their final year of undergraduate enrollment in order to begin the program during the fall quarter following the completion of their undergraduate degree. ESAP students are not required to take the GRE. ESAP students are required to provide 2 letters of recommendation. For the 3rd letter of recommendation, please enter the name as “ESAP ESAP”, email as your own email address, ceeapply@seas.ucla.edu, or saadmin@seas.ucla.edu, and type as “Graduate Division Recommendation”. Students must meet ESAP requirements and the department must receive ESAP notification in order to receive the benefits of the ESAP program.\nQuestions?\nRefer to the ESAP website. ESAP eligibility questions should be directed to Jan LaBuda (jan@seas.ucla.edu). Civil Engineering application questions should be directed to ceeapply@seas.ucla.edu.",

Specific requirements (individual majors may have 500, 1,000 or 1,500 word limits; this information is in the application and on the each program’s website) and prompts are listed in the application and include\nThe Personal Statement is an opportunity for you to provide additional information that may aid the selection committee in evaluating your preparation and aptitude for graduate study at UCLA, including your contribution to diversity. The statement will also be used to consider candidates for the Cota-Robles & GOFP awards, which provide financial support to graduate students who make significant contributions to diversity. In the word’s of the University of California Diversity Statement, “Diversity” – a defining feature of California’s past, present and future – refers to the variety of personal experiences, values, and worldviews that arise from differences of culture and circumstance. Such differences include race, ethnicity, gender, age, religion, language, abilities/disabilities, sexual orientation, gender identity, socioeconomic status, geographic region, and more.” The complete text of this statement can be found online.\nInstructions to respond to one of more of the following prompts, including at least one prompt speaking to your contributions to diversity, are provided in the application and include a 500 words limit (approximately 1-page, single spaced, using 1-inch margins and 12-point font):\nThe faculty of each graduate program evaluate applicants who meet the minimum requirements and recommend a selection from among them. The number of qualified applicants to graduate programs at UCLA far exceeds the number of students who can be admitted.\nThe general requirement for admission for a U.S. student is a bachelor’s degree from a regionally accredited institution, comparable in standard and content to a bachelor’s degree from the University of California. Graduate admission through the regular process requires an overall scholastic average, including any post-baccalaureate study, of B (3.0 on a 4.0 scale) or better, or its equivalent if the letter grade system is not used. However, through the “Dean’s Special Action” (DSA) process, departments are able to admit applicants who do not meet this GPA requirement when other aspects of the applicant’s file suggest readiness for graduate study. The DSA process requires no additional action on the applicant’s part; it is at the department’s discretion to initiate it. Prospective applicants are encouraged, however, to see section 500.4.B on page 6 of UCLA’s Guidelines for the Graduate Admissions Process & Codification of Policies Governing Admission for more information about the DSA process.\nDegrees which are not considered comparable include those granted on the basis of work completed at institutions which are not fully accredited and those granted on the basis of nonacademic prior learning, test scores, or other than organized supervised coursework in academic subjects.\nAn international student whose post-secondary education is completed outside of the U.S. is expected to hold a degree representing completion of at least four years of study with above average/very good scholarship from a university or university-level institution.\nApplicants, including U.S. citizens and Permanent Residents, who do not hold a bachelor’s or higher degree from a university located in the United States or in another country in which English is both the spoken language of daily life and the medium of instruction, or who have not completed at least two years of full-time study at such an institution, please consult English Requirements.\nPlease review:\nSubmitted application materials are reviewed by faculty admissions committees in each major program who select the best qualified applicants. These admissions committees base recommendations for admission upon a careful comparison of applications, and this may take considerable time. Diversity, Inclusion and Admissions, therefore, cannot guarantee that the applicant will receive a response, favorable or unfavorable, on or before any specific date. The applicant, moreover, should not construe a lack of response as an intention to act favorably on the application.\nIf you receive an email about a discrepancy, please don’t worry. If you applied to UCLA before (or were an employee or a student), there may be a mismatch between your name or other personal data on the application and what is already in UCLA’s database. Many of these discrepancies (such as a name change) are resolved by the Division of Graduate Education staff without further need for communication, and the situation does not impede review of your application by the program. If you receive the discrepancy email a second time, please respond using the contact information in the email.\nWhen a decision is made, applicants receive an email, directing them to the Division of Graduate Education’s application site and the option Decision Status. Applicants sign in using the email address used to create their application account (not the User Name) and their application password to read the official decision letter.\nIf admitted, the conditions of admission and information and instructions concerning registration (via a link to the Statement of Intent to Register and a Statement of Legal Residence) will be included as part of the offer of admission letter, which can be printed out from the Division of Graduate Education site. (International applicants: please read Visa Procedures/Financial Verification.)\nOnly official notification from the dean of the Division of Graduate Education constitutes approval of admission.\nAlthough sometimes casually referred to as such, April 15th is not a deadline for graduate decision notification. Rather it is the date in the Council of Graduate Schools (CGS) Resolution before which no signatory institution may pressure an admitted applicant to accept an offer of admission with funding.\nCGS implemented this date to insure that admitted applicants have the opportunity to consider multiple offers of funding, instead of feeling the need to grab the first offer presented.  This is not a deadline by which institutions must reply to all applicants; CGS specifies that “Programs and/or institutions are free to make offers of admission and of financial support after April 15 if they choose to do so.”\nIf you wish to read more about the Council of Graduate Schools resolution re: April 15th.\nAs indicated above, and because of the decentralized nature of the graduate admissions process (applications are reviewed by individual faculty committees in the more than 100 academic and professional graduate majors offered), UCLA cannot guarantee a response to your application by a certain date.\nBoth the concurrent and articulated degree programs have the potential of allowing the student to acquire two degrees in less time than normally required if the courses of instruction are taken in sequence.\nView a list of concurrent and articulated degree programs at UCLA.\n• They are enrolled in a college or university and submit proof of receiving need-based financial aid,\n• or they meet income limits and submit their U.S. income tax form (with Social Security number redacted).\n• Submit a statement from your Financial Aid officer confirming all of the above and stating that payment of UCLA’s $135.00 application fee would be a financial hardship.\n• Submit a copy of your 2023 U.S. Federal Income Tax return.

University housing consists of off-campus apartments for married, single parent and single graduate students.\n• Student Parking Information\nStudent parking assignments are made on a need-based point system that considers such factors as class standing and commute distance, and favors those students who demonstrate the greatest need. If you wish to obtain an individual parking permit, you must submit a Student Parking Request form prior to the quarterly deadlines.\n• Summer Session\nThe UCLA Summer Sessions offer approximately 500 undergraduate and graduate courses each summer. Up-to-date information on course offerings, policies, and fees is available on the Summer Sessions and Special Programs website by mid-January each year.\n• Disabled Student Services\nThe University of California, Los Angeles actively encourages persons with disabilities to apply for admission. Federal Law (Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973) prohibits the University from requesting disability related information prior to admission. However, at any time, applicants are welcome to contact the Center for Accessible Education to obtain information regarding access, programs and available services.\n• Program Requirements\nOfficial listing of degree requirements by program.\n• General Catalog\nUCLA online catalog.\n[HTML_TABLE]\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5 | $23,828\n$32,227\n$40,626\n$49,025\n$57,424\n[CARD]\nX\n[CARD]\nX",
