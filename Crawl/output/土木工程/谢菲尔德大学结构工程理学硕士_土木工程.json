It’s that simple. The PGCE course helps you develop an understanding of research, policies and practice relating to education in general and secondary education in particular. You’ll analyse and reflect on what you learn to connect research with the classroom.\nWe teach an approach to your work that will stay with you throughout your career. Our graduates are dedicated to lifelong learning, developing their professional practice, and using classroom-based research. You’ll learn everything the qualified teacher needs to know about planning, teaching, learning, assessing, policies and processes.\nIn our most recent Ofsted inspection, our secondary-age teacher training was rated as ‘Outstanding’.\nWe offer a provider-led route plus two routes in partnership with local schools (The University of Sheffield in partnership with Sheffield Teacher Training Alliance and The University of Sheffield in partnership with Ashfield School).\nThe main differences for the two additional routes are:\nThese two routes run alongside the provider-led PGCE and lead to the same qualification.\nThe University of Sheffield oversees these routes.\nSecondary (11–19).\nAs well as a PGCE qualification and Qualified Teacher Status, you will qualify with 60 masters credits, which you may wish to put towards study for an MA Applied Professional Studies in Education.\nWe offer teacher training for 11- to 19-year-olds in English, geography, history, mathematics, languages and science.\nSubject programmes are regularly updated and may be occasionally withdrawn.\nThe English course is a research-led, reflective and exciting course presenting a balanced approach to language and literacy development. \nWe encourage critical reflection which will enable teachers to develop their own rationale for English in school. Fiction, drama, poetry, media and cultural studies, as well as elements of language study, are all given an important place on the course. There is an emphasis on academic reading and critical enquiry, as well as upon practical experience in the classroom; student teachers frequently share the benefits of their experiences and research with their peers in both formal and informal situations.\nCourse overview\nUniversity sessions are practical and workshop based, allowing opportunities to try out teaching ideas. Student teachers will be asked to study children's fiction, poetry and Shakespeare in order to discuss ways of presenting them in class and to read children's writing in order to decide how to respond to it positively. There will be additional workshops on A Level teaching, drama and media education.\nA close relationship is maintained with the English departments of the Universities Partnership schools and there is close consultation between the PGCE tutor and the English mentor in the schools.\nWhat are we looking for?\nAs this is an 11-19 course you will train to teach up to A Level. We will normally take into account the balance of your degree content and your profile of GCSE and A Level (or equivalent) subjects and results to assess your suitability for the programme.\nYou will need a degree that is predominantly English based, either in Language or Literature. If you have other related degree qualifications (such as in Law or in Journalism), we would like evidence of a strong engagement with literature and/or language-related work and that that you have read widely across a range of literature types, including Shakespeare.\nThe English course is a research-led, reflective and exciting course presenting a balanced approach to language and literacy development.\nWe encourage critical reflection which will enable teachers to develop their own rationale for English in school.

This course will help you to develop teaching strategies and skills so that you can use your enthusiasm to interest and motivate pupils.\nSheffield offers excellent opportunities for geography PGCE student teachers and our course is regarded highly both locally and nationally. The course is planned to promote teaching as a research-based profession in which critical understanding is developed alongside practical competence. Alongside this, several of the schools supporting geography student teachers have been at the forefront of geographical education in this country for many years, and many are involved in innovative approaches to education.\nCourse overview\nThe geography curriculum course aims to develop your confidence to enable you to teach in a wide variety of situations. The course takes into account the requirements of examination specifications at GCSE, A Level and the geography National Curriculum and enables you to develop a critical understanding of recent developments. The theoretical foundations which underlie approaches to teaching and learning are considered, particularly with regard to how these relate to geography teaching in schools.\nThe use and application of digital technology is a major feature of the work of teachers and there will be opportunities for you to gain practical experience in this area. The course will help you to develop expertise in fieldwork activities and working with pupils outside the classroom. All student teachers will have the opportunity to attend a weekend course at Cranedale Field Studies centre in Yorkshire to find out more about teaching geography in the field. Some student teachers will also have the opportunity to participate in field trips organised by schools.\nGeographically, Sheffield and its surroundings provide an interesting area for local studies and field-work. The border of the Peak District National Park is within five miles of the University of Sheffield and the towns and cities of South Yorkshire provide good examples of urban renewal and redevelopment. Furthermore, the national headquarters of the Geographical Association (GA) is in Sheffield and student teachers are expected to become active members of the GA.\nWhat are we looking for?\nYou will need a degree in geography or have at least 50% of your degree in geography. As this is an 11-19 course we are also preparing students to teach up to A Level and we will normally take into account the balance of your degree classification and your profile of A Level results.\nGeography is an important and dynamic subject and has an important role in educating young people to live successfully in a diverse society and a changing world.

Our PGCE course will enable you to develop teaching strategies and skills so that you can use your knowledge and enthusiasm for history to engage and motivate pupils.\nWe see no divide between theory and practice.

It’s that simple. The PGCE course helps you develop an understanding of research, policies and practice relating to education in general and secondary education in particular. You’ll analyse and reflect on what you learn to connect research with the classroom.We teach an approach to your work that will stay with you throughout your career. Our graduates are dedicated to lifelong learning, developing their professional practice, and using classroom-based research. You’ll learn everything the qualified teacher needs to know about planning, teaching, learning, assessing, policies and processes.In our most recent Ofsted inspection, our secondary-age teacher training was rated as ‘Outstanding’.Routes offeredWe offer a provider-led route plus two routes in partnership with local schools (The University of Sheffield in partnership with Sheffield Teacher Training Alliance and The University of Sheffield in partnership with Ashfield School). The main differences for the two additional routes are:You’ll have your two school placements in the schools within the cluster that you are attached to, rather than in any school across the partnership.The schools in your cluster will have a greater input into the PGCE programme throughout the year.There will be a strong possibility of securing employment within the cluster of schools that you are attached to, subject to availability and suitability.These two routes run alongside the provider-led PGCE and lead to the same qualification. The University of Sheffield oversees these routes.Sheffield Teacher Training Alliance (STTA)Lead partner: Silverdale SchoolLocated in Sheffield.Subjects offered are geography, mathematics, physics and chemistry.STTAAshfield School ITTLead partner: Ashfield SchoolLocated in Nottingham.Subjects offered are English, geography, mathematics, physics, chemistry, history, biology, physics with maths and languages.Age rangeSecondary (11–19).Masters creditsAs well as a PGCE qualification and Qualified Teacher Status, you will qualify with 60 masters credits, which you may wish to put towards study for an MA Applied Professional Studies in Education.\n\n\nModules\nWe offer teacher training for 11- to 19-year-olds in English, geography, history, mathematics, languages and science.Subject programmes are regularly updated and may be occasionally withdrawn. \n\n\n\n\n\n      English\n    \n\n      Geography\n    \n\n      History\n    \n\n      Mathematics\n    \n\n      Languages\n    \n\n      Science\n    \n\n\n\n\nThe English course is a research-led, reflective and exciting course presenting a balanced approach to language and literacy development. \nWe encourage critical reflection which will enable teachers to develop their own rationale for English in school. Fiction, drama, poetry, media and cultural studies, as well as elements of language study, are all given an important place on the course. There is an emphasis on academic reading and critical enquiry, as well as upon practical experience in the classroom; student teachers frequently share the benefits of their experiences and research with their peers in both formal and informal situations.\nCourse overview\nUniversity sessions are practical and workshop based, allowing opportunities to try out teaching ideas. Student teachers will be asked to study children's fiction, poetry and Shakespeare in order to discuss ways of presenting them in class and to read children's writing in order to decide how to respond to it positively. There will be additional workshops on A Level teaching, drama and media education.\nA close relationship is maintained with the English departments of the Universities Partnership schools and there is close consultation between the PGCE tutor and the English mentor in the schools.\nWhat are we looking for?\nAs this is an 11-19 course you will train to teach up to A Level. We will normally take into account the balance of your degree content and your profile of GCSE and A Level (or equivalent) subjects and results to assess your suitability for the programme.\nYou will need a degree that is predominantly English based, either in Language or Literature. If you have other related degree qualifications (such as in Law or in Journalism), we would like evidence of a strong engagement with literature and/or language-related work and that that you have read widely across a range of literature types, including Shakespeare.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeography is an important and dynamic subject and has an important role in educating young people to live successfully in a diverse society and a changing world. This course will help you to develop teaching strategies and skills so that you can use your enthusiasm to interest and motivate pupils.\nSheffield offers excellent opportunities for geography PGCE student teachers and our course is regarded highly both locally and nationally. The course is planned to promote teaching as a research-based profession in which critical understanding is developed alongside practical competence. Alongside this, several of the schools supporting geography student teachers have been at the forefront of geographical education in this country for many years, and many are involved in innovative approaches to education.\nCourse overview\nThe geography curriculum course aims to develop your confidence to enable you to teach in a wide variety of situations. The course takes into account the requirements of examination specifications at GCSE, A Level and the geography National Curriculum and enables you to develop a critical understanding of recent developments. The theoretical foundations which underlie approaches to teaching and learning are considered, particularly with regard to how these relate to geography teaching in schools.\nThe use and application of digital technology is a major feature of the work of teachers and there will be opportunities for you to gain practical experience in this area. The course will help you to develop expertise in fieldwork activities and working with pupils outside the classroom. All student teachers will have the opportunity to attend a weekend course at Cranedale Field Studies centre in Yorkshire to find out more about teaching geography in the field. Some student teachers will also have the opportunity to participate in field trips organised by schools.\nGeographically, Sheffield and its surroundings provide an interesting area for local studies and field-work. The border of the Peak District National Park is within five miles of the University of Sheffield and the towns and cities of South Yorkshire provide good examples of urban renewal and redevelopment. Furthermore, the national headquarters of the Geographical Association (GA) is in Sheffield and student teachers are expected to become active members of the GA.\nWhat are we looking for?\nYou will need a degree in geography or have at least 50% of your degree in geography. As this is an 11-19 course we are also preparing students to teach up to A Level and we will normally take into account the balance of your degree classification and your profile of A Level results.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistory plays a significant role in educating young people to become well informed and active participants in a diverse society.

Other important aspects of work include lesson planning, laboratory safety and first aid issues for science teachers.\nYou will receive appropriate support through University taught sessions that are designed to enhance your subject knowledge together with your pedagogic content knowledge. This work is complemented by sessions to support your subject specialisms at KS3, 4 and post 16. Physics with Mathematics student teachers will work principally with fellow science student teachers, but will have sessions based with mathematics PGCE students as well. In all University-based sessions you are expected to be an active participant.\nCoursework is practically oriented and closely related to teaching and learning.\nWhat are we looking for?\nAs this is an 11-19 course we are preparing students to teach up to A-level and we will normally take into account the balance of your degree content and your profile of GCSE and A Level (or equivalent) subjects and results to assess your suitability for the programme.\nIt is usual to have a first degree which had at least half of its content in your science specialist subject (biology, chemistry or physics). We do accept graduates of other science-related disciplines, such as engineering, earth science, materials science, clinical disciplines and psychology. In such cases tutors can advise whether a subject knowledge enhancement course would be necessary prior to commencement of the course.\nPhysics with Mathematics applicants would usually be expected to have a physics, mathematics or engineering based degree, along with A Levels in physics and mathematics. All PGCE science student teachers, irrespective of degree subject, have curriculum 'gaps' to fill during the course. Because of this, a capacity for disciplined self-study is a characteristic of student teachers who do well. Other key personal characteristics are curiosity, perseverance, and organisation. If you are a graduate with these qualities in abundance you should thrive on the course.\nFor further information about training to teach Physics in England please visit the Teach Physics page on the Get into Teaching website.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content of our courses is reviewed annually to make sure it's up-to-date and relevant.

It’s that simple. The PGCE course helps you develop an understanding of research, policies and practice relating to education in general and secondary education in particular. You’ll analyse and reflect on what you learn to connect research with the classroom.We teach an approach to your work that will stay with you throughout your career. Our graduates are dedicated to lifelong learning, developing their professional practice, and using classroom-based research. You’ll learn everything the qualified teacher needs to know about planning, teaching, learning, assessing, policies and processes.In our most recent Ofsted inspection, our secondary-age teacher training was rated as ‘Outstanding’.Routes offeredWe offer a provider-led route plus two routes in partnership with local schools (The University of Sheffield in partnership with Sheffield Teacher Training Alliance and The University of Sheffield in partnership with Ashfield School). The main differences for the two additional routes are:You’ll have your two school placements in the schools within the cluster that you are attached to, rather than in any school across the partnership.The schools in your cluster will have a greater input into the PGCE programme throughout the year.There will be a strong possibility of securing employment within the cluster of schools that you are attached to, subject to availability and suitability.These two routes run alongside the provider-led PGCE and lead to the same qualification. The University of Sheffield oversees these routes.Sheffield Teacher Training Alliance (STTA)Lead partner: Silverdale SchoolLocated in Sheffield.Subjects offered are geography, mathematics, physics and chemistry.STTAAshfield School ITTLead partner: Ashfield SchoolLocated in Nottingham.Subjects offered are English, geography, mathematics, physics, chemistry, history, biology, physics with maths and languages.Age rangeSecondary (11–19).Masters creditsAs well as a PGCE qualification and Qualified Teacher Status, you will qualify with 60 masters credits, which you may wish to put towards study for an MA Applied Professional Studies in Education.\n\n\nModules\nWe offer teacher training for 11- to 19-year-olds in English, geography, history, mathematics, languages and science.Subject programmes are regularly updated and may be occasionally withdrawn. \n\n\n\n\n\n      English\n    \n\n      Geography\n    \n\n      History\n    \n\n      Mathematics\n    \n\n      Languages\n    \n\n      Science\n    \n\n\n\n\nThe English course is a research-led, reflective and exciting course presenting a balanced approach to language and literacy development. \nWe encourage critical reflection which will enable teachers to develop their own rationale for English in school. Fiction, drama, poetry, media and cultural studies, as well as elements of language study, are all given an important place on the course. There is an emphasis on academic reading and critical enquiry, as well as upon practical experience in the classroom; student teachers frequently share the benefits of their experiences and research with their peers in both formal and informal situations.\nCourse overview\nUniversity sessions are practical and workshop based, allowing opportunities to try out teaching ideas. Student teachers will be asked to study children's fiction, poetry and Shakespeare in order to discuss ways of presenting them in class and to read children's writing in order to decide how to respond to it positively. There will be additional workshops on A Level teaching, drama and media education.\nA close relationship is maintained with the English departments of the Universities Partnership schools and there is close consultation between the PGCE tutor and the English mentor in the schools.\nWhat are we looking for?\nAs this is an 11-19 course you will train to teach up to A Level. We will normally take into account the balance of your degree content and your profile of GCSE and A Level (or equivalent) subjects and results to assess your suitability for the programme.\nYou will need a degree that is predominantly English based, either in Language or Literature. If you have other related degree qualifications (such as in Law or in Journalism), we would like evidence of a strong engagement with literature and/or language-related work and that that you have read widely across a range of literature types, including Shakespeare.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeography is an important and dynamic subject and has an important role in educating young people to live successfully in a diverse society and a changing world. This course will help you to develop teaching strategies and skills so that you can use your enthusiasm to interest and motivate pupils.\nSheffield offers excellent opportunities for geography PGCE student teachers and our course is regarded highly both locally and nationally. The course is planned to promote teaching as a research-based profession in which critical understanding is developed alongside practical competence. Alongside this, several of the schools supporting geography student teachers have been at the forefront of geographical education in this country for many years, and many are involved in innovative approaches to education.\nCourse overview\nThe geography curriculum course aims to develop your confidence to enable you to teach in a wide variety of situations. The course takes into account the requirements of examination specifications at GCSE, A Level and the geography National Curriculum and enables you to develop a critical understanding of recent developments. The theoretical foundations which underlie approaches to teaching and learning are considered, particularly with regard to how these relate to geography teaching in schools.\nThe use and application of digital technology is a major feature of the work of teachers and there will be opportunities for you to gain practical experience in this area. The course will help you to develop expertise in fieldwork activities and working with pupils outside the classroom. All student teachers will have the opportunity to attend a weekend course at Cranedale Field Studies centre in Yorkshire to find out more about teaching geography in the field. Some student teachers will also have the opportunity to participate in field trips organised by schools.\nGeographically, Sheffield and its surroundings provide an interesting area for local studies and field-work. The border of the Peak District National Park is within five miles of the University of Sheffield and the towns and cities of South Yorkshire provide good examples of urban renewal and redevelopment. Furthermore, the national headquarters of the Geographical Association (GA) is in Sheffield and student teachers are expected to become active members of the GA.\nWhat are we looking for?\nYou will need a degree in geography or have at least 50% of your degree in geography. As this is an 11-19 course we are also preparing students to teach up to A Level and we will normally take into account the balance of your degree classification and your profile of A Level results.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistory plays a significant role in educating young people to become well informed and active participants in a diverse society. Our PGCE course will enable you to develop teaching strategies and skills so that you can use your knowledge and enthusiasm for history to engage and motivate pupils.\nWe see no divide between theory and practice. Our work in the University is intensely practical and your practice in school must be thoughtful and reflective. You will belong to a history subject group supported by university subject tutors with years of experience in teaching history in secondary schools. There will also be an opportunity to participate in a range of externally provided training including ‘Teaching the Holocaust’.\nCourse overview\nYou will consider how to manage a classroom successfully and how to engage pupils of different ages and abilities in the learning of history. The emphasis is on a collaborative, seminar style of learning.\nThe use and application of digital technologies is a feature of the work of teachers and there will be opportunities for you to gain practical experience in this area, as well as in various forms of history fieldwork which are used to provide experience in planning and organising school history visits.\nWhat are we looking for?\nYou will need a degree in history or have at least 50% of your degree in history. As this is an 11-19 course we are also preparing students to teach up to A Level and we will normally take into account the balance of your degree classification and your profile of A Level results.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur PGCE in mathematics will help you share your enthusiasm for this interesting subject and to develop teaching strategies and skills that will empower the pupils to generate their own interest and motivation. \nMathematics teaching is constantly developing, now involving the use and application of digital technologies, you will gain practical experience in this area.\nWe see no divide between theory and practice. Our work in the University is intensely practical and your practice in school must be thoughtful and reflective. The mathematics PGCE course is organised around three themes:\n\nTeaching and learning\nMathematics subject knowledge\nIssues in mathematics education\n\nIn the university sessions, you will be actively involved in your learning, through leading seminars and presenting to your peers. We work closely with local schools and involve mathematics teachers from partnership schools who make significant contributions to the taught programme.\nWhat are we looking for?\nYou will need a degree in mathematics or have at least 50% of your degree in mathematics. If your degree has less than 50% mathematics, we might still accept you, subject to your completion of a mathematics Subject Knowledge Enhancement course. As this is an 11-19 course we are also preparing students to teach up to A Level and we will normally take into account the balance of your degree classification and your profile of A Level results.\nFor further information about training to teach Maths in England please visit the Become a Maths Teacher page on the Get into Teaching website.\n\n\n\n\nLanguages teachers need to be enthusiastic, resourceful, innovative and imaginative in order to create an exciting environment for language learning. The PGCE Languages course is designed to enable you to respond to this challenge. It also takes account of the local and national policy contexts, encouraging an awareness of the many opportunities which exist to support language teaching and learning.\nWe will train you to be a reflective practitioner, and the academic masters-level work on the course fosters a deeper understanding and critical stance in relation to language pedagogy and teaching and learning in secondary schools.\nCourse overview\nApplicants will specialise in two languages from French, German and Spanish and it is common for applicants to have a main and support language. The main language is the language you studied at degree level, in conjunction with a sustained period abroad in the target language country; this is the language you will teach on the course to A Level. The support language may be a language you took to A Level yourself and it will provide the basis for you to teach to at least KS3.\nAlongside this and subject to school availability, it may be possible to offer very limited places for Japanese, Chinese, Russian or Urdu plus one other language from French or Spanish. Please contact the course coordinator before applying.\nThe languages element of the PGCE is designed to give you the confidence and skills you will need. The course brings together theory, practice, and research, to explore methods and strategies appropriate to the range of teaching situations likely to be met in an all-ability school.\nIn addition to periods of block school experience, other school visits are organised and student teachers can also take part in the activities of The Association for Language Learning (ALL).\nWhat are we looking for?\nAs this is an 11-19 course we are preparing you to teach up to A Level and we will normally take into account the balance of your degree content and your profile of GCSE and A Level (or equivalent) subjects and results to assess your suitability for the programme.\nMost applicants will have studied one or both languages as a major part of their degree and we expect a total of at least three months´ residence in an appropriate country. Native speakers may have a degree in another subject. They will, however, need to demonstrate an adequate level of spoken and written English. It is desirable for applicants to have spent time in a secondary school in the United Kingdom either working, volunteering or as a visitor and to have spent some time with the Languages department in particular.\nWe will consider applicants for whom French and Spanish is their only specialist language. However, we will strongly recommend at interview that these candidates undertake a SKE (if eligible) or private course in an additional language to improve their employability once qualified. \nCandidates for Mandarin, Russian, Japanese and Urdu courses should have competency in their second language to teach to at least Year 9 (14 years old) level. This is required as the listed languages are only taught in select schools across the country and finding placements and future employment can be difficult without the ability to offer a second language.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe PGCE in science is offered in the following ways:\n\nScience with Biology\nScience with Chemistry\nScience with Physics\nPhysics with Mathematics\n\nCourse overview\nAll science courses aim to prepare you with a passionate commitment to the subject which you are able to teach confidently and creatively to 11-19 year olds.\nThe Science with Biology, Chemistry or Physics courses are designed to prepare you to teach Balanced Science in the National Curriculum at Key Stage 3, and in your specialist subject at Key Stage 4 and post-16 courses. The Physics with Mathematics course is designed to prepare you to teach Physics at Key Stage 4 and post -16 and Mathematics at Key Stage 3 and 4.\nThe University teaching team has extensive science teaching experience across the science curriculum.

It also takes account of the local and national policy contexts, encouraging an awareness of the many opportunities which exist to support language teaching and learning.\nWe will train you to be a reflective practitioner, and the academic masters-level work on the course fosters a deeper understanding and critical stance in relation to language pedagogy and teaching and learning in secondary schools.\nCourse overview\nApplicants will specialise in two languages from French, German and Spanish and it is common for applicants to have a main and support language. The main language is the language you studied at degree level, in conjunction with a sustained period abroad in the target language country; this is the language you will teach on the course to A Level. The support language may be a language you took to A Level yourself and it will provide the basis for you to teach to at least KS3.\nAlongside this and subject to school availability, it may be possible to offer very limited places for Japanese, Chinese, Russian or Urdu plus one other language from French or Spanish. Please contact the course coordinator before applying.\nThe languages element of the PGCE is designed to give you the confidence and skills you will need. The course brings together theory, practice, and research, to explore methods and strategies appropriate to the range of teaching situations likely to be met in an all-ability school.\nIn addition to periods of block school experience, other school visits are organised and student teachers can also take part in the activities of The Association for Language Learning (ALL).\nWhat are we looking for?\nAs this is an 11-19 course we are preparing you to teach up to A Level and we will normally take into account the balance of your degree content and your profile of GCSE and A Level (or equivalent) subjects and results to assess your suitability for the programme.\nMost applicants will have studied one or both languages as a major part of their degree and we expect a total of at least three months´ residence in an appropriate country. Native speakers may have a degree in another subject. They will, however, need to demonstrate an adequate level of spoken and written English. It is desirable for applicants to have spent time in a secondary school in the United Kingdom either working, volunteering or as a visitor and to have spent some time with the Languages department in particular.\nWe will consider applicants for whom French and Spanish is their only specialist language. However, we will strongly recommend at interview that these candidates undertake a SKE (if eligible) or private course in an additional language to improve their employability once qualified. \nCandidates for Mandarin, Russian, Japanese and Urdu courses should have competency in their second language to teach to at least Year 9 (14 years old) level. This is required as the listed languages are only taught in select schools across the country and finding placements and future employment can be difficult without the ability to offer a second language.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe PGCE in science is offered in the following ways:\n\nScience with Biology\nScience with Chemistry\nScience with Physics\nPhysics with Mathematics\n\nCourse overview\nAll science courses aim to prepare you with a passionate commitment to the subject which you are able to teach confidently and creatively to 11-19 year olds.\nThe Science with Biology, Chemistry or Physics courses are designed to prepare you to teach Balanced Science in the National Curriculum at Key Stage 3, and in your specialist subject at Key Stage 4 and post-16 courses.

It’s that simple. The PGCE course helps you develop an understanding of research, policies and practice relating to education in general and secondary education in particular. You’ll analyse and reflect on what you learn to connect research with the classroom.We teach an approach to your work that will stay with you throughout your career. Our graduates are dedicated to lifelong learning, developing their professional practice, and using classroom-based research. You’ll learn everything the qualified teacher needs to know about planning, teaching, learning, assessing, policies and processes.In our most recent Ofsted inspection, our secondary-age teacher training was rated as ‘Outstanding’.Routes offeredWe offer a provider-led route plus two routes in partnership with local schools (The University of Sheffield in partnership with Sheffield Teacher Training Alliance and The University of Sheffield in partnership with Ashfield School). The main differences for the two additional routes are:You’ll have your two school placements in the schools within the cluster that you are attached to, rather than in any school across the partnership.The schools in your cluster will have a greater input into the PGCE programme throughout the year.There will be a strong possibility of securing employment within the cluster of schools that you are attached to, subject to availability and suitability.These two routes run alongside the provider-led PGCE and lead to the same qualification. The University of Sheffield oversees these routes.Sheffield Teacher Training Alliance (STTA)Lead partner: Silverdale SchoolLocated in Sheffield.Subjects offered are geography, mathematics, physics and chemistry.STTAAshfield School ITTLead partner: Ashfield SchoolLocated in Nottingham.Subjects offered are English, geography, mathematics, physics, chemistry, history, biology, physics with maths and languages.Age rangeSecondary (11–19).Masters creditsAs well as a PGCE qualification and Qualified Teacher Status, you will qualify with 60 masters credits, which you may wish to put towards study for an MA Applied Professional Studies in Education.\n\n\nModules\nWe offer teacher training for 11- to 19-year-olds in English, geography, history, mathematics, languages and science.Subject programmes are regularly updated and may be occasionally withdrawn. \n\n\n\n\n\n      English\n    \n\n      Geography\n    \n\n      History\n    \n\n      Mathematics\n    \n\n      Languages\n    \n\n      Science\n    \n\n\n\n\nThe English course is a research-led, reflective and exciting course presenting a balanced approach to language and literacy development. \nWe encourage critical reflection which will enable teachers to develop their own rationale for English in school. Fiction, drama, poetry, media and cultural studies, as well as elements of language study, are all given an important place on the course. There is an emphasis on academic reading and critical enquiry, as well as upon practical experience in the classroom; student teachers frequently share the benefits of their experiences and research with their peers in both formal and informal situations.\nCourse overview\nUniversity sessions are practical and workshop based, allowing opportunities to try out teaching ideas. Student teachers will be asked to study children's fiction, poetry and Shakespeare in order to discuss ways of presenting them in class and to read children's writing in order to decide how to respond to it positively. There will be additional workshops on A Level teaching, drama and media education.\nA close relationship is maintained with the English departments of the Universities Partnership schools and there is close consultation between the PGCE tutor and the English mentor in the schools.\nWhat are we looking for?\nAs this is an 11-19 course you will train to teach up to A Level. We will normally take into account the balance of your degree content and your profile of GCSE and A Level (or equivalent) subjects and results to assess your suitability for the programme.\nYou will need a degree that is predominantly English based, either in Language or Literature. If you have other related degree qualifications (such as in Law or in Journalism), we would like evidence of a strong engagement with literature and/or language-related work and that that you have read widely across a range of literature types, including Shakespeare.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeography is an important and dynamic subject and has an important role in educating young people to live successfully in a diverse society and a changing world. This course will help you to develop teaching strategies and skills so that you can use your enthusiasm to interest and motivate pupils.\nSheffield offers excellent opportunities for geography PGCE student teachers and our course is regarded highly both locally and nationally. The course is planned to promote teaching as a research-based profession in which critical understanding is developed alongside practical competence. Alongside this, several of the schools supporting geography student teachers have been at the forefront of geographical education in this country for many years, and many are involved in innovative approaches to education.\nCourse overview\nThe geography curriculum course aims to develop your confidence to enable you to teach in a wide variety of situations. The course takes into account the requirements of examination specifications at GCSE, A Level and the geography National Curriculum and enables you to develop a critical understanding of recent developments. The theoretical foundations which underlie approaches to teaching and learning are considered, particularly with regard to how these relate to geography teaching in schools.\nThe use and application of digital technology is a major feature of the work of teachers and there will be opportunities for you to gain practical experience in this area. The course will help you to develop expertise in fieldwork activities and working with pupils outside the classroom. All student teachers will have the opportunity to attend a weekend course at Cranedale Field Studies centre in Yorkshire to find out more about teaching geography in the field. Some student teachers will also have the opportunity to participate in field trips organised by schools.\nGeographically, Sheffield and its surroundings provide an interesting area for local studies and field-work. The border of the Peak District National Park is within five miles of the University of Sheffield and the towns and cities of South Yorkshire provide good examples of urban renewal and redevelopment. Furthermore, the national headquarters of the Geographical Association (GA) is in Sheffield and student teachers are expected to become active members of the GA.\nWhat are we looking for?\nYou will need a degree in geography or have at least 50% of your degree in geography. As this is an 11-19 course we are also preparing students to teach up to A Level and we will normally take into account the balance of your degree classification and your profile of A Level results.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistory plays a significant role in educating young people to become well informed and active participants in a diverse society. Our PGCE course will enable you to develop teaching strategies and skills so that you can use your knowledge and enthusiasm for history to engage and motivate pupils.\nWe see no divide between theory and practice. Our work in the University is intensely practical and your practice in school must be thoughtful and reflective. You will belong to a history subject group supported by university subject tutors with years of experience in teaching history in secondary schools. There will also be an opportunity to participate in a range of externally provided training including ‘Teaching the Holocaust’.\nCourse overview\nYou will consider how to manage a classroom successfully and how to engage pupils of different ages and abilities in the learning of history.

Native speakers may have a degree in another subject. They will, however, need to demonstrate an adequate level of spoken and written English. It is desirable for applicants to have spent time in a secondary school in the United Kingdom either working, volunteering or as a visitor and to have spent some time with the Languages department in particular.\nWe will consider applicants for whom French and Spanish is their only specialist language. However, we will strongly recommend at interview that these candidates undertake a SKE (if eligible) or private course in an additional language to improve their employability once qualified. \nCandidates for Mandarin, Russian, Japanese and Urdu courses should have competency in their second language to teach to at least Year 9 (14 years old) level. This is required as the listed languages are only taught in select schools across the country and finding placements and future employment can be difficult without the ability to offer a second language.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe PGCE in science is offered in the following ways:\n\nScience with Biology\nScience with Chemistry\nScience with Physics\nPhysics with Mathematics\n\nCourse overview\nAll science courses aim to prepare you with a passionate commitment to the subject which you are able to teach confidently and creatively to 11-19 year olds.\nThe Science with Biology, Chemistry or Physics courses are designed to prepare you to teach Balanced Science in the National Curriculum at Key Stage 3, and in your specialist subject at Key Stage 4 and post-16 courses.

In all University-based sessions you are expected to be an active participant.\nCoursework is practically oriented and closely related to teaching and learning.\nWhat are we looking for?\nAs this is an 11-19 course we are preparing students to teach up to A-level and we will normally take into account the balance of your degree content and your profile of GCSE and A Level (or equivalent) subjects and results to assess your suitability for the programme.\nIt is usual to have a first degree which had at least half of its content in your science specialist subject (biology, chemistry or physics). We do accept graduates of other science-related disciplines, such as engineering, earth science, materials science, clinical disciplines and psychology. In such cases tutors can advise whether a subject knowledge enhancement course would be necessary prior to commencement of the course.\nPhysics with Mathematics applicants would usually be expected to have a physics, mathematics or engineering based degree, along with A Levels in physics and mathematics. All PGCE science student teachers, irrespective of degree subject, have curriculum 'gaps' to fill during the course. Because of this, a capacity for disciplined self-study is a characteristic of student teachers who do well. Other key personal characteristics are curiosity, perseverance, and organisation.

It’s that simple. The PGCE course helps you develop an understanding of research, policies and practice relating to education in general and secondary education in particular. You’ll analyse and reflect on what you learn to connect research with the classroom.We teach an approach to your work that will stay with you throughout your career. Our graduates are dedicated to lifelong learning, developing their professional practice, and using classroom-based research. You’ll learn everything the qualified teacher needs to know about planning, teaching, learning, assessing, policies and processes.In our most recent Ofsted inspection, our secondary-age teacher training was rated as ‘Outstanding’.Routes offeredWe offer a provider-led route plus two routes in partnership with local schools (The University of Sheffield in partnership with Sheffield Teacher Training Alliance and The University of Sheffield in partnership with Ashfield School). The main differences for the two additional routes are:You’ll have your two school placements in the schools within the cluster that you are attached to, rather than in any school across the partnership.The schools in your cluster will have a greater input into the PGCE programme throughout the year.There will be a strong possibility of securing employment within the cluster of schools that you are attached to, subject to availability and suitability.These two routes run alongside the provider-led PGCE and lead to the same qualification. The University of Sheffield oversees these routes.Sheffield Teacher Training Alliance (STTA)Lead partner: Silverdale SchoolLocated in Sheffield.Subjects offered are geography, mathematics, physics and chemistry.STTAAshfield School ITTLead partner: Ashfield SchoolLocated in Nottingham.Subjects offered are English, geography, mathematics, physics, chemistry, history, biology, physics with maths and languages.Age rangeSecondary (11–19).Masters creditsAs well as a PGCE qualification and Qualified Teacher Status, you will qualify with 60 masters credits, which you may wish to put towards study for an MA Applied Professional Studies in Education.\n\n\nModules\nWe offer teacher training for 11- to 19-year-olds in English, geography, history, mathematics, languages and science.Subject programmes are regularly updated and may be occasionally withdrawn. \n\n\n\n\n\n      English\n    \n\n      Geography\n    \n\n      History\n    \n\n      Mathematics\n    \n\n      Languages\n    \n\n      Science\n    \n\n\n\n\nThe English course is a research-led, reflective and exciting course presenting a balanced approach to language and literacy development. \nWe encourage critical reflection which will enable teachers to develop their own rationale for English in school.

It also takes account of the local and national policy contexts, encouraging an awareness of the many opportunities which exist to support language teaching and learning.\nWe will train you to be a reflective practitioner, and the academic masters-level work on the course fosters a deeper understanding and critical stance in relation to language pedagogy and teaching and learning in secondary schools.\nCourse overview\nApplicants will specialise in two languages from French, German and Spanish and it is common for applicants to have a main and support language. The main language is the language you studied at degree level, in conjunction with a sustained period abroad in the target language country; this is the language you will teach on the course to A Level. The support language may be a language you took to A Level yourself and it will provide the basis for you to teach to at least KS3.\nAlongside this and subject to school availability, it may be possible to offer very limited places for Japanese, Chinese, Russian or Urdu plus one other language from French or Spanish. Please contact the course coordinator before applying.\nThe languages element of the PGCE is designed to give you the confidence and skills you will need.

Native speakers may have a degree in another subject. They will, however, need to demonstrate an adequate level of spoken and written English. It is desirable for applicants to have spent time in a secondary school in the United Kingdom either working, volunteering or as a visitor and to have spent some time with the Languages department in particular.\nWe will consider applicants for whom French and Spanish is their only specialist language. However, we will strongly recommend at interview that these candidates undertake a SKE (if eligible) or private course in an additional language to improve their employability once qualified. \nCandidates for Mandarin, Russian, Japanese and Urdu courses should have competency in their second language to teach to at least Year 9 (14 years old) level. This is required as the listed languages are only taught in select schools across the country and finding placements and future employment can be difficult without the ability to offer a second language.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe PGCE in science is offered in the following ways:\n\nScience with Biology\nScience with Chemistry\nScience with Physics\nPhysics with Mathematics\n\nCourse overview\nAll science courses aim to prepare you with a passionate commitment to the subject which you are able to teach confidently and creatively to 11-19 year olds.\nThe Science with Biology, Chemistry or Physics courses are designed to prepare you to teach Balanced Science in the National Curriculum at Key Stage 3, and in your specialist subject at Key Stage 4 and post-16 courses.

If you are a graduate with these qualities in abundance you should thrive on the course.\nFor further information about training to teach Physics in England please visit the Teach Physics page on the Get into Teaching website.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content of our courses is reviewed annually to make sure it's up-to-date and relevant.

The aim of the module is to equip non-financial students with an appropriate level of financial competence - and confidence - and hence view accounting and financial management from the perspective of general management: that is, as users of financial information. This means that learning does not take the form of a series of textbook technical exercises, but grasps concepts and applies them to the real world, as demonstrated on the case company. The accounting element of the module is concerned primarily with the usefulness and limitations of accounting and market data in published financial statements, governance and internal reports and controls, business planning, operational decisions, pricing decisions, and performance management. The financial management element of the module examines the role of accounting and market data to support financing decisions, investing decisions and cash and working capital management.\n10 credits\n\n\nManaging Organisational Behaviour\n\n\nThis unit aims to provide students with an understanding of a systematic set of behavioural science concepts for analysing human behaviour in organisations.  The major theories and research findings in this area derive from the academic disciplines of psychology, sociology and anthropology and students will be expected to familiarise themselves as directed.  Further, the unit provides the opportunity to relate these theoretical concepts to realistic organisational problems and to consider appropriate managerial responses.  In this way, the unit is designed not only to increase the ability to analyse behaviour but also to develop the skill to draw on appropriate concepts to influence and manage others effectively in organisational contexts.\n10 credits\n\n\nOperations Management\n\n\nThis module is concerned with the effective and efficient marshalling of the organisation's resources to meet its objectives. An understanding of fundamental concepts and techniques will be provided and used by students to tackle cases which apply to manufacturing and service industries in both private and public sectors. The systematic and logical approach of Operational Research to the solution of management problems is also introduced.\n10 credits\n\n\nGlobal Managerial Economics\n\n\nThis module focuses on the analysis of factors that affect strategic decisions and performance of firms from an economic perspective. This includes organisation-level factors and issues such as the contractual relationships among the different stakeholders of firms and optimal boundaries of firms, as well as the structure and contestability of markets within which they operate. There is particular emphasis on strategic interactions with competitors, designing of contracts in an environment of imperfect (asymmetric) information, and the role of transactions cost in influencing key strategic decisions  involving both domestic and international operations of firms. Finally, there is discussion about the factors that influence the regulatory and macroeconomic contexts in which firms operate, including the relevance of interconnectedness of economies for domestic macroeconomic and regulatory environments. As such, the aim of the module is to provide a coherent picture of application of economic principles to different aspects of managerial decision making.\n10 credits\n\n\nThe Intelligent Organisation\n\n\nAn intelligent organisation strategically harnesses data and disruptive technologies to achieve its overarching objectives. The insights generated from extensive internal and external data pools empower organisations to operate with enhanced effectiveness and efficiency. For example, Big Data Analytics helps organisations to identify new opportunities and predict future scenarios. Simultaneously, disruptive technologies like Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things further strengthen data-driven organisations by automating underlying business processes. This module therefore focuses on how data and disruptive technologies enable organisations to achieve high levels of digital transformation. It also provides insights into how to assess the readiness for digital transformation and the challenges of delivering digital transformation projects. This module uses interactive lectures, hands-on sessions, guest lectures from industry experts, and case studies to introduce core concepts and their uses in the real world.\n10 credits\n\n\nMarketing Consultancy Challenge\n\n\nThis module integrates consulting with marketing through application on a real company project. You will become familiar with the marketing process, the practice and critical importance of marketing as well as important managerial decisions including those about the choice of the target market, the nature of the offerings and marketing strategies that are aimed at communicating and delivering values. While marketing will provide a set of principles and context, consultancy will provide students with an opportunity to apply theoretically grounded consulting principles into a client based marketing problem. The rationale is that many business consulting projects are driven by the initial need for improvement in markets, products and channels to customers, branding, the design of associated processes etc.\n20 credits\n\n\nPersonal, Professional and Career Development\n\n\nThe Personal, Professional and Career Development (PPCD) module is an integral element in the MBA journey, which runs throughout your MBA programme. It is designed to help you cultivate your self awareness and develop the skills needed to achieve your personal, professional and career development goals. This involves personal development and career planning, and setting objectives and identifying strategies to achieve them. The personal element will encompass, for example, self-awareness, self-care, wellbeing, and defining what success means. The professional element is concerned with development activities linked to professionalism and leadership skills development. The career element of this module involves supporting you in achieving your career aspirations which might extend beyond one particular employer or entrepreneurial venture.  These skills include, for example, networking, team working, negotiation, interview skills, etc. The delivery of this module will be through a wide range of in-class learning, interactive sessions led by experts, industry visits and extra-curricular activities.\n5 credits\nCore modules:\nAs managers in businesses, social enterprises or governmental organisations, an ability to interpret accounting reports and exercise financial judgment is essential.

Continue developing your understanding of a variety of business functions, tailoring the programme to your interests as you select elective modules. The Personal, Professional and Career Development module will continue to elevate your capabilities, equipping you with the tools and insights to excel as you return to the workplace and make a lasting impact on your career.\nCore modules:\n\n\nNew Venture Creation Challenge\n\n\nThis is a project-based module in which, working in small groups, you will research and develop a business plan for a new venture. With facilitation and coaching, you will select an entrepreneurial idea and develop it into a comprehensive and fully detailed written business plan. All aspects of the business must be thoroughly researched and the written plan must include five years of financial projections. The module also considers what it takes to become more entrepreneurial or 'intrapreneurial', by critically considering to what extent it is possible to replicate entrepreneurial DNA. The module considers the importance of organisational leadership, structure, systems, strategies and cultures. The overarching aim is to enable you to assess entrepreneurial orientation and its potential both in theory and practice.\n10 credits\n\n\nStrategic Management\n\n\nThis module examines what we mean by organisational strategy and how strategy is realised in organisations. Strategy can be conceived as the direction and scope of an organisation over the long term and also as an organizational activity and set of practices to do with, for example, strategic analysis and strategic planning as well as processes of negotiation and persuasion. Strategic management entails making distinctive choices that are consequential for the long-term direction, scope and survival of an organisation - often in a turbulent environment, with rapid economic, regulatory, technological, ecological and social changes. Furthermore, strategy formation, implementation, and change involve not just top management, but a variety of organizational members and external stakeholders. On this module you will engage with this complexity through a set of lectures, class discussion and debate, case analysis, and reflection on your experience, with the aim of developing your ability to critically deploy key theories and frameworks to diagnose strategic issues and make informed strategic decisions.\n10 credits\n\n\nEffective and Responsible Leadership\n\n\nThe need for effective and responsible leadership has never been greater, with the ethics and sustainability of organisational practices becoming increasingly scrutinised. Consequently, leading ethically and responsibly is crucial for the financial and socio-ecological sustainability of organisations. This module will explore perspectives on leadership to consider the meanings and practices of leading effectively and responsibly in different contexts. By undertaking a range of classroom activities and developing a reflective portfolio, you will learn to critically reflect on your and others' leadership and followership in order to develop your abilities.\n10 credits\n\n\nInternationalisation Challenge\n\n\nThis module focuses on international business opportunities and the processes, strategies and theories that entrepreneurs, and managers need to follow and apply to pursue them. The primary disciplines for this module are international business, strategy and entrepreneurship which are brought together around the idea that to pursue international opportunities, the firm needs to internationalise, and understand how to do so strategically and effectively. The aim of this module is to enable students to understand and integrate theory and apply it to interpretation and analysis in very specific firm and country contexts, to generate theoretical understanding and practical outcomes for a specified firm.\n10 credits\n\n\nIndividual MBA Challenge\n\n\nThis is an individual project taken towards the end of the Sheffield MBA programme and allows the student to demonstrate the ability to research a management issue within an academic framework and within the context of a specific organisation or industry. It utilises knowledge and skills acquired in the earlier part of the programme, and is executed under the general guidance of a supervisor. The module will also equip students with the frameworks and approaches needed while researching in the field of Management. A dissertation written by the student should be delivered to the School at the conclusion.\n45 credits\n\n\nPersonal, Professional and Career Development\n\n\nThe Personal, Professional and Career Development (PPCD) module is an integral element in the MBA journey, which runs throughout your MBA programme.

A dissertation written by the student should be delivered to the School at the conclusion.\nYou will select 2 of the 4 elective modules:\n\n\nHuman Resource Management\n\n\nThis module has three objectives.  It is intended to develop an understanding of the international and comparative factors (such as national culture) that shape human resource management.  It will also build functional knowledge of the main tools and techniques used in the HRM field.  Finally, it will develop an awareness of some of the most pertinent HRM issues in Europe, the Far East and America.  Teaching methods for the option will combine the project method, formal lectures, videos, case study analysis, analysis of example HRM tools and techniques and Powerpoint presentations.\n10 credits\n\n\nStrategic Management Accounting\n\n\nThis module explores the way in which management accounting information can play an important role in the strategic development of organisations. It recognises the need for management accounting to be more externally focussed and for it to provide information that helps organisations face up to strategic uncertainties. The concept of strategic management accounting is relevant for both private and public sector organisations.\n10 credits\n\n\nCorporate Finance\n\n\nThis module examines how corporate decision-makers determine policies on funding and firm investment choices. It assesses both areas by scrutinizing background theory and real applications. The module addresses some of the pivotal areas of concern for financial decision-makers, including the formulation of recommendations and policies on investment appraisal, corporate leverage, dividend policy, stock buy-backs, risk management, and CSR-engagement. The module will address such issues within the context of perfect (frictionless) and imperfect market settings and will also stress the role of external capital markets (debt and equity) in relation to the growth cycle of a listed firm.\n10 credits\n\n\nOrganisational Crisis Management\n\n\nCrisis management is an emerging area of management research and practice reflecting the growing scope and scale for organisational disruptions. This module adopts a processual and broad systems perspective to understanding how crises can emerge in organisations and how best managers might prepare for, mitigate and manage these. This is an integrative module which draws upon multi-disciplinary perspectives to provide learners with conceptual insights and analytical tools needed to be effective managers. The teaching strategy is underpinned by case studies developed by the module leader and others. This approach allows students to enhance their critical and analytical skills by evaluating real world management practice and developing their own crisis management abilities through formulating appropriate strategic and operational responses.\n10 credits\nYou will select 2 of the 4 elective modules:\nThis module has three objectives.

The aim of the module is to equip non-financial students with an appropriate level of financial competence - and confidence - and hence view accounting and financial management from the perspective of general management: that is, as users of financial information. This means that learning does not take the form of a series of textbook technical exercises, but grasps concepts and applies them to the real world, as demonstrated on the case company. The accounting element of the module is concerned primarily with the usefulness and limitations of accounting and market data in published financial statements, governance and internal reports and controls, business planning, operational decisions, pricing decisions, and performance management. The financial management element of the module examines the role of accounting and market data to support financing decisions, investing decisions and cash and working capital management.\n10 credits\n\n\nManaging Organisational Behaviour\n\n\nThis unit aims to provide students with an understanding of a systematic set of behavioural science concepts for analysing human behaviour in organisations.  The major theories and research findings in this area derive from the academic disciplines of psychology, sociology and anthropology and students will be expected to familiarise themselves as directed.  Further, the unit provides the opportunity to relate these theoretical concepts to realistic organisational problems and to consider appropriate managerial responses.  In this way, the unit is designed not only to increase the ability to analyse behaviour but also to develop the skill to draw on appropriate concepts to influence and manage others effectively in organisational contexts.\n10 credits\n\n\nOperations Management\n\n\nThis module is concerned with the effective and efficient marshalling of the organisation's resources to meet its objectives. An understanding of fundamental concepts and techniques will be provided and used by students to tackle cases which apply to manufacturing and service industries in both private and public sectors. The systematic and logical approach of Operational Research to the solution of management problems is also introduced.\n10 credits\n\n\nGlobal Managerial Economics\n\n\nThis module focuses on the analysis of factors that affect strategic decisions and performance of firms from an economic perspective. This includes organisation-level factors and issues such as the contractual relationships among the different stakeholders of firms and optimal boundaries of firms, as well as the structure and contestability of markets within which they operate. There is particular emphasis on strategic interactions with competitors, designing of contracts in an environment of imperfect (asymmetric) information, and the role of transactions cost in influencing key strategic decisions  involving both domestic and international operations of firms. Finally, there is discussion about the factors that influence the regulatory and macroeconomic contexts in which firms operate, including the relevance of interconnectedness of economies for domestic macroeconomic and regulatory environments. As such, the aim of the module is to provide a coherent picture of application of economic principles to different aspects of managerial decision making.\n10 credits\n\n\nThe Intelligent Organisation\n\n\nAn intelligent organisation strategically harnesses data and disruptive technologies to achieve its overarching objectives. The insights generated from extensive internal and external data pools empower organisations to operate with enhanced effectiveness and efficiency. For example, Big Data Analytics helps organisations to identify new opportunities and predict future scenarios. Simultaneously, disruptive technologies like Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things further strengthen data-driven organisations by automating underlying business processes. This module therefore focuses on how data and disruptive technologies enable organisations to achieve high levels of digital transformation. It also provides insights into how to assess the readiness for digital transformation and the challenges of delivering digital transformation projects. This module uses interactive lectures, hands-on sessions, guest lectures from industry experts, and case studies to introduce core concepts and their uses in the real world.\n10 credits\n\n\nMarketing Consultancy Challenge\n\n\nThis module integrates consulting with marketing through application on a real company project. You will become familiar with the marketing process, the practice and critical importance of marketing as well as important managerial decisions including those about the choice of the target market, the nature of the offerings and marketing strategies that are aimed at communicating and delivering values. While marketing will provide a set of principles and context, consultancy will provide students with an opportunity to apply theoretically grounded consulting principles into a client based marketing problem. The rationale is that many business consulting projects are driven by the initial need for improvement in markets, products and channels to customers, branding, the design of associated processes etc.\n20 credits\n\n\nPersonal, Professional and Career Development\n\n\nThe Personal, Professional and Career Development (PPCD) module is an integral element in the MBA journey, which runs throughout your MBA programme. It is designed to help you cultivate your self awareness and develop the skills needed to achieve your personal, professional and career development goals. This involves personal development and career planning, and setting objectives and identifying strategies to achieve them. The personal element will encompass, for example, self-awareness, self-care, wellbeing, and defining what success means. The professional element is concerned with development activities linked to professionalism and leadership skills development. The career element of this module involves supporting you in achieving your career aspirations which might extend beyond one particular employer or entrepreneurial venture.  These skills include, for example, networking, team working, negotiation, interview skills, etc. The delivery of this module will be through a wide range of in-class learning, interactive sessions led by experts, industry visits and extra-curricular activities.\n5 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelop your consultancy skills on the AGCAS award nominated Internationalisation Challenge module, as well as the Individual MBA Challenge, collaborating with local clients to drive global impact. Continue developing your understanding of a variety of business functions, tailoring the programme to your interests as you select elective modules. The Personal, Professional and Career Development module will continue to elevate your capabilities, equipping you with the tools and insights to excel as you return to the workplace and make a lasting impact on your career.\n\n\n\n Core modules:\n\n\nNew Venture Creation Challenge\n\n\nThis is a project-based module in which, working in small groups, you will research and develop a business plan for a new venture. With facilitation and coaching, you will select an entrepreneurial idea and develop it into a comprehensive and fully detailed written business plan. All aspects of the business must be thoroughly researched and the written plan must include five years of financial projections. The module also considers what it takes to become more entrepreneurial or 'intrapreneurial', by critically considering to what extent it is possible to replicate entrepreneurial DNA. The module considers the importance of organisational leadership, structure, systems, strategies and cultures. The overarching aim is to enable you to assess entrepreneurial orientation and its potential both in theory and practice.\n10 credits\n\n\nStrategic Management\n\n\nThis module examines what we mean by organisational strategy and how strategy is realised in organisations. Strategy can be conceived as the direction and scope of an organisation over the long term and also as an organizational activity and set of practices to do with, for example, strategic analysis and strategic planning as well as processes of negotiation and persuasion. Strategic management entails making distinctive choices that are consequential for the long-term direction, scope and survival of an organisation - often in a turbulent environment, with rapid economic, regulatory, technological, ecological and social changes. Furthermore, strategy formation, implementation, and change involve not just top management, but a variety of organizational members and external stakeholders. On this module you will engage with this complexity through a set of lectures, class discussion and debate, case analysis, and reflection on your experience, with the aim of developing your ability to critically deploy key theories and frameworks to diagnose strategic issues and make informed strategic decisions.\n10 credits\n\n\nEffective and Responsible Leadership\n\n\nThe need for effective and responsible leadership has never been greater, with the ethics and sustainability of organisational practices becoming increasingly scrutinised. Consequently, leading ethically and responsibly is crucial for the financial and socio-ecological sustainability of organisations. This module will explore perspectives on leadership to consider the meanings and practices of leading effectively and responsibly in different contexts. By undertaking a range of classroom activities and developing a reflective portfolio, you will learn to critically reflect on your and others' leadership and followership in order to develop your abilities.\n10 credits\n\n\nInternationalisation Challenge\n\n\nThis module focuses on international business opportunities and the processes, strategies and theories that entrepreneurs, and managers need to follow and apply to pursue them. The primary disciplines for this module are international business, strategy and entrepreneurship which are brought together around the idea that to pursue international opportunities, the firm needs to internationalise, and understand how to do so strategically and effectively. The aim of this module is to enable students to understand and integrate theory and apply it to interpretation and analysis in very specific firm and country contexts, to generate theoretical understanding and practical outcomes for a specified firm.\n10 credits\n\n\nIndividual MBA Challenge\n\n\nThis is an individual project taken towards the end of the Sheffield MBA programme and allows the student to demonstrate the ability to research a management issue within an academic framework and within the context of a specific organisation or industry. It utilises knowledge and skills acquired in the earlier part of the programme, and is executed under the general guidance of a supervisor. The module will also equip students with the frameworks and approaches needed while researching in the field of Management. A dissertation written by the student should be delivered to the School at the conclusion.\n45 credits\n\n\nPersonal, Professional and Career Development\n\n\nThe Personal, Professional and Career Development (PPCD) module is an integral element in the MBA journey, which runs throughout your MBA programme. It is designed to help you cultivate your self awareness and develop the skills needed to achieve your personal, professional and career development goals. This involves personal development and career planning, and setting objectives and identifying strategies to achieve them. The personal element will encompass, for example, self-awareness, self-care, wellbeing, and defining what success means. The professional element is concerned with development activities linked to professionalism and leadership skills development. The career element of this module involves supporting you in achieving your career aspirations which might extend beyond one particular employer or entrepreneurial venture.  These skills include, for example, networking, team working, negotiation, interview skills, etc. The delivery of this module will be through a wide range of in-class learning, interactive sessions led by experts, industry visits and extra-curricular activities.\n5 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n You will select 2 of the 4 elective modules:\n\n\nHuman Resource Management\n\n\nThis module has three objectives.  It is intended to develop an understanding of the international and comparative factors (such as national culture) that shape human resource management.  It will also build functional knowledge of the main tools and techniques used in the HRM field.  Finally, it will develop an awareness of some of the most pertinent HRM issues in Europe, the Far East and America.  Teaching methods for the option will combine the project method, formal lectures, videos, case study analysis, analysis of example HRM tools and techniques and Powerpoint presentations.\n10 credits\n\n\nStrategic Management Accounting\n\n\nThis module explores the way in which management accounting information can play an important role in the strategic development of organisations. It recognises the need for management accounting to be more externally focussed and for it to provide information that helps organisations face up to strategic uncertainties. The concept of strategic management accounting is relevant for both private and public sector organisations.\n10 credits\n\n\nCorporate Finance\n\n\nThis module examines how corporate decision-makers determine policies on funding and firm investment choices. It assesses both areas by scrutinizing background theory and real applications. The module addresses some of the pivotal areas of concern for financial decision-makers, including the formulation of recommendations and policies on investment appraisal, corporate leverage, dividend policy, stock buy-backs, risk management, and CSR-engagement. The module will address such issues within the context of perfect (frictionless) and imperfect market settings and will also stress the role of external capital markets (debt and equity) in relation to the growth cycle of a listed firm.\n10 credits\n\n\nOrganisational Crisis Management\n\n\nCrisis management is an emerging area of management research and practice reflecting the growing scope and scale for organisational disruptions. This module adopts a processual and broad systems perspective to understanding how crises can emerge in organisations and how best managers might prepare for, mitigate and manage these. This is an integrative module which draws upon multi-disciplinary perspectives to provide learners with conceptual insights and analytical tools needed to be effective managers. The teaching strategy is underpinned by case studies developed by the module leader and others. This approach allows students to enhance their critical and analytical skills by evaluating real world management practice and developing their own crisis management abilities through formulating appropriate strategic and operational responses.\n10 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content of our courses is reviewed annually to make sure it's up-to-date and relevant.

The aim of the module is to equip non-financial students with an appropriate level of financial competence - and confidence - and hence view accounting and financial management from the perspective of general management: that is, as users of financial information. This means that learning does not take the form of a series of textbook technical exercises, but grasps concepts and applies them to the real world, as demonstrated on the case company. The accounting element of the module is concerned primarily with the usefulness and limitations of accounting and market data in published financial statements, governance and internal reports and controls, business planning, operational decisions, pricing decisions, and performance management. The financial management element of the module examines the role of accounting and market data to support financing decisions, investing decisions and cash and working capital management.\n10 credits\n\n\nManaging Organisational Behaviour\n\n\nThis unit aims to provide students with an understanding of a systematic set of behavioural science concepts for analysing human behaviour in organisations.  The major theories and research findings in this area derive from the academic disciplines of psychology, sociology and anthropology and students will be expected to familiarise themselves as directed.  Further, the unit provides the opportunity to relate these theoretical concepts to realistic organisational problems and to consider appropriate managerial responses.  In this way, the unit is designed not only to increase the ability to analyse behaviour but also to develop the skill to draw on appropriate concepts to influence and manage others effectively in organisational contexts.\n10 credits\n\n\nOperations Management\n\n\nThis module is concerned with the effective and efficient marshalling of the organisation's resources to meet its objectives. An understanding of fundamental concepts and techniques will be provided and used by students to tackle cases which apply to manufacturing and service industries in both private and public sectors. The systematic and logical approach of Operational Research to the solution of management problems is also introduced.\n10 credits\n\n\nGlobal Managerial Economics\n\n\nThis module focuses on the analysis of factors that affect strategic decisions and performance of firms from an economic perspective. This includes organisation-level factors and issues such as the contractual relationships among the different stakeholders of firms and optimal boundaries of firms, as well as the structure and contestability of markets within which they operate. There is particular emphasis on strategic interactions with competitors, designing of contracts in an environment of imperfect (asymmetric) information, and the role of transactions cost in influencing key strategic decisions  involving both domestic and international operations of firms. Finally, there is discussion about the factors that influence the regulatory and macroeconomic contexts in which firms operate, including the relevance of interconnectedness of economies for domestic macroeconomic and regulatory environments. As such, the aim of the module is to provide a coherent picture of application of economic principles to different aspects of managerial decision making.\n10 credits\n\n\nThe Intelligent Organisation\n\n\nAn intelligent organisation strategically harnesses data and disruptive technologies to achieve its overarching objectives. The insights generated from extensive internal and external data pools empower organisations to operate with enhanced effectiveness and efficiency. For example, Big Data Analytics helps organisations to identify new opportunities and predict future scenarios. Simultaneously, disruptive technologies like Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things further strengthen data-driven organisations by automating underlying business processes. This module therefore focuses on how data and disruptive technologies enable organisations to achieve high levels of digital transformation. It also provides insights into how to assess the readiness for digital transformation and the challenges of delivering digital transformation projects. This module uses interactive lectures, hands-on sessions, guest lectures from industry experts, and case studies to introduce core concepts and their uses in the real world.\n10 credits\n\n\nMarketing Consultancy Challenge\n\n\nThis module integrates consulting with marketing through application on a real company project. You will become familiar with the marketing process, the practice and critical importance of marketing as well as important managerial decisions including those about the choice of the target market, the nature of the offerings and marketing strategies that are aimed at communicating and delivering values. While marketing will provide a set of principles and context, consultancy will provide students with an opportunity to apply theoretically grounded consulting principles into a client based marketing problem. The rationale is that many business consulting projects are driven by the initial need for improvement in markets, products and channels to customers, branding, the design of associated processes etc.\n20 credits\n\n\nPersonal, Professional and Career Development\n\n\nThe Personal, Professional and Career Development (PPCD) module is an integral element in the MBA journey, which runs throughout your MBA programme. It is designed to help you cultivate your self awareness and develop the skills needed to achieve your personal, professional and career development goals. This involves personal development and career planning, and setting objectives and identifying strategies to achieve them. The personal element will encompass, for example, self-awareness, self-care, wellbeing, and defining what success means. The professional element is concerned with development activities linked to professionalism and leadership skills development. The career element of this module involves supporting you in achieving your career aspirations which might extend beyond one particular employer or entrepreneurial venture.  These skills include, for example, networking, team working, negotiation, interview skills, etc. The delivery of this module will be through a wide range of in-class learning, interactive sessions led by experts, industry visits and extra-curricular activities.\n5 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelop your consultancy skills on the AGCAS award nominated Internationalisation Challenge module, as well as the Individual MBA Challenge, collaborating with local clients to drive global impact. Continue developing your understanding of a variety of business functions, tailoring the programme to your interests as you select elective modules. The Personal, Professional and Career Development module will continue to elevate your capabilities, equipping you with the tools and insights to excel as you return to the workplace and make a lasting impact on your career.\n\n\n\n Core modules:\n\n\nNew Venture Creation Challenge\n\n\nThis is a project-based module in which, working in small groups, you will research and develop a business plan for a new venture. With facilitation and coaching, you will select an entrepreneurial idea and develop it into a comprehensive and fully detailed written business plan. All aspects of the business must be thoroughly researched and the written plan must include five years of financial projections. The module also considers what it takes to become more entrepreneurial or 'intrapreneurial', by critically considering to what extent it is possible to replicate entrepreneurial DNA. The module considers the importance of organisational leadership, structure, systems, strategies and cultures. The overarching aim is to enable you to assess entrepreneurial orientation and its potential both in theory and practice.\n10 credits\n\n\nStrategic Management\n\n\nThis module examines what we mean by organisational strategy and how strategy is realised in organisations. Strategy can be conceived as the direction and scope of an organisation over the long term and also as an organizational activity and set of practices to do with, for example, strategic analysis and strategic planning as well as processes of negotiation and persuasion. Strategic management entails making distinctive choices that are consequential for the long-term direction, scope and survival of an organisation - often in a turbulent environment, with rapid economic, regulatory, technological, ecological and social changes. Furthermore, strategy formation, implementation, and change involve not just top management, but a variety of organizational members and external stakeholders. On this module you will engage with this complexity through a set of lectures, class discussion and debate, case analysis, and reflection on your experience, with the aim of developing your ability to critically deploy key theories and frameworks to diagnose strategic issues and make informed strategic decisions.\n10 credits\n\n\nEffective and Responsible Leadership\n\n\nThe need for effective and responsible leadership has never been greater, with the ethics and sustainability of organisational practices becoming increasingly scrutinised. Consequently, leading ethically and responsibly is crucial for the financial and socio-ecological sustainability of organisations. This module will explore perspectives on leadership to consider the meanings and practices of leading effectively and responsibly in different contexts. By undertaking a range of classroom activities and developing a reflective portfolio, you will learn to critically reflect on your and others' leadership and followership in order to develop your abilities.\n10 credits\n\n\nInternationalisation Challenge\n\n\nThis module focuses on international business opportunities and the processes, strategies and theories that entrepreneurs, and managers need to follow and apply to pursue them. The primary disciplines for this module are international business, strategy and entrepreneurship which are brought together around the idea that to pursue international opportunities, the firm needs to internationalise, and understand how to do so strategically and effectively. The aim of this module is to enable students to understand and integrate theory and apply it to interpretation and analysis in very specific firm and country contexts, to generate theoretical understanding and practical outcomes for a specified firm.\n10 credits\n\n\nIndividual MBA Challenge\n\n\nThis is an individual project taken towards the end of the Sheffield MBA programme and allows the student to demonstrate the ability to research a management issue within an academic framework and within the context of a specific organisation or industry. It utilises knowledge and skills acquired in the earlier part of the programme, and is executed under the general guidance of a supervisor. The module will also equip students with the frameworks and approaches needed while researching in the field of Management. A dissertation written by the student should be delivered to the School at the conclusion.\n45 credits\n\n\nPersonal, Professional and Career Development\n\n\nThe Personal, Professional and Career Development (PPCD) module is an integral element in the MBA journey, which runs throughout your MBA programme. It is designed to help you cultivate your self awareness and develop the skills needed to achieve your personal, professional and career development goals. This involves personal development and career planning, and setting objectives and identifying strategies to achieve them. The personal element will encompass, for example, self-awareness, self-care, wellbeing, and defining what success means. The professional element is concerned with development activities linked to professionalism and leadership skills development. The career element of this module involves supporting you in achieving your career aspirations which might extend beyond one particular employer or entrepreneurial venture.  These skills include, for example, networking, team working, negotiation, interview skills, etc. The delivery of this module will be through a wide range of in-class learning, interactive sessions led by experts, industry visits and extra-curricular activities.\n5 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n You will select 2 of the 4 elective modules:\n\n\nHuman Resource Management\n\n\nThis module has three objectives.  It is intended to develop an understanding of the international and comparative factors (such as national culture) that shape human resource management.  It will also build functional knowledge of the main tools and techniques used in the HRM field.  Finally, it will develop an awareness of some of the most pertinent HRM issues in Europe, the Far East and America.  Teaching methods for the option will combine the project method, formal lectures, videos, case study analysis, analysis of example HRM tools and techniques and Powerpoint presentations.\n10 credits\n\n\nStrategic Management Accounting\n\n\nThis module explores the way in which management accounting information can play an important role in the strategic development of organisations. It recognises the need for management accounting to be more externally focussed and for it to provide information that helps organisations face up to strategic uncertainties. The concept of strategic management accounting is relevant for both private and public sector organisations.\n10 credits\n\n\nCorporate Finance\n\n\nThis module examines how corporate decision-makers determine policies on funding and firm investment choices. It assesses both areas by scrutinizing background theory and real applications. The module addresses some of the pivotal areas of concern for financial decision-makers, including the formulation of recommendations and policies on investment appraisal, corporate leverage, dividend policy, stock buy-backs, risk management, and CSR-engagement. The module will address such issues within the context of perfect (frictionless) and imperfect market settings and will also stress the role of external capital markets (debt and equity) in relation to the growth cycle of a listed firm.\n10 credits\n\n\nOrganisational Crisis Management\n\n\nCrisis management is an emerging area of management research and practice reflecting the growing scope and scale for organisational disruptions. This module adopts a processual and broad systems perspective to understanding how crises can emerge in organisations and how best managers might prepare for, mitigate and manage these. This is an integrative module which draws upon multi-disciplinary perspectives to provide learners with conceptual insights and analytical tools needed to be effective managers. The teaching strategy is underpinned by case studies developed by the module leader and others. This approach allows students to enhance their critical and analytical skills by evaluating real world management practice and developing their own crisis management abilities through formulating appropriate strategic and operational responses.\n10 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content of our courses is reviewed annually to make sure it's up-to-date and relevant.

You will apply teachings from the Professional, Personal and Career Development module to build real relationships and expand your professional network, laying the foundations for success as you embark on your MBA journey. \n\n\n\n Core modules:\n\n\nAccounting and Financial Management\n\n\nAs managers in businesses, social enterprises or governmental organisations, an ability to interpret accounting reports and exercise financial judgment is essential. The aim of the module is to equip non-financial students with an appropriate level of financial competence - and confidence - and hence view accounting and financial management from the perspective of general management: that is, as users of financial information. This means that learning does not take the form of a series of textbook technical exercises, but grasps concepts and applies them to the real world, as demonstrated on the case company. The accounting element of the module is concerned primarily with the usefulness and limitations of accounting and market data in published financial statements, governance and internal reports and controls, business planning, operational decisions, pricing decisions, and performance management. The financial management element of the module examines the role of accounting and market data to support financing decisions, investing decisions and cash and working capital management.\n10 credits\n\n\nManaging Organisational Behaviour\n\n\nThis unit aims to provide students with an understanding of a systematic set of behavioural science concepts for analysing human behaviour in organisations.  The major theories and research findings in this area derive from the academic disciplines of psychology, sociology and anthropology and students will be expected to familiarise themselves as directed.  Further, the unit provides the opportunity to relate these theoretical concepts to realistic organisational problems and to consider appropriate managerial responses.  In this way, the unit is designed not only to increase the ability to analyse behaviour but also to develop the skill to draw on appropriate concepts to influence and manage others effectively in organisational contexts.\n10 credits\n\n\nOperations Management\n\n\nThis module is concerned with the effective and efficient marshalling of the organisation's resources to meet its objectives. An understanding of fundamental concepts and techniques will be provided and used by students to tackle cases which apply to manufacturing and service industries in both private and public sectors. The systematic and logical approach of Operational Research to the solution of management problems is also introduced.\n10 credits\n\n\nGlobal Managerial Economics\n\n\nThis module focuses on the analysis of factors that affect strategic decisions and performance of firms from an economic perspective. This includes organisation-level factors and issues such as the contractual relationships among the different stakeholders of firms and optimal boundaries of firms, as well as the structure and contestability of markets within which they operate. There is particular emphasis on strategic interactions with competitors, designing of contracts in an environment of imperfect (asymmetric) information, and the role of transactions cost in influencing key strategic decisions  involving both domestic and international operations of firms. Finally, there is discussion about the factors that influence the regulatory and macroeconomic contexts in which firms operate, including the relevance of interconnectedness of economies for domestic macroeconomic and regulatory environments. As such, the aim of the module is to provide a coherent picture of application of economic principles to different aspects of managerial decision making.\n10 credits\n\n\nThe Intelligent Organisation\n\n\nAn intelligent organisation strategically harnesses data and disruptive technologies to achieve its overarching objectives. The insights generated from extensive internal and external data pools empower organisations to operate with enhanced effectiveness and efficiency. For example, Big Data Analytics helps organisations to identify new opportunities and predict future scenarios. Simultaneously, disruptive technologies like Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things further strengthen data-driven organisations by automating underlying business processes. This module therefore focuses on how data and disruptive technologies enable organisations to achieve high levels of digital transformation. It also provides insights into how to assess the readiness for digital transformation and the challenges of delivering digital transformation projects. This module uses interactive lectures, hands-on sessions, guest lectures from industry experts, and case studies to introduce core concepts and their uses in the real world.\n10 credits\n\n\nMarketing Consultancy Challenge\n\n\nThis module integrates consulting with marketing through application on a real company project. You will become familiar with the marketing process, the practice and critical importance of marketing as well as important managerial decisions including those about the choice of the target market, the nature of the offerings and marketing strategies that are aimed at communicating and delivering values. While marketing will provide a set of principles and context, consultancy will provide students with an opportunity to apply theoretically grounded consulting principles into a client based marketing problem. The rationale is that many business consulting projects are driven by the initial need for improvement in markets, products and channels to customers, branding, the design of associated processes etc.\n20 credits\n\n\nPersonal, Professional and Career Development\n\n\nThe Personal, Professional and Career Development (PPCD) module is an integral element in the MBA journey, which runs throughout your MBA programme. It is designed to help you cultivate your self awareness and develop the skills needed to achieve your personal, professional and career development goals. This involves personal development and career planning, and setting objectives and identifying strategies to achieve them. The personal element will encompass, for example, self-awareness, self-care, wellbeing, and defining what success means. The professional element is concerned with development activities linked to professionalism and leadership skills development. The career element of this module involves supporting you in achieving your career aspirations which might extend beyond one particular employer or entrepreneurial venture.  These skills include, for example, networking, team working, negotiation, interview skills, etc. The delivery of this module will be through a wide range of in-class learning, interactive sessions led by experts, industry visits and extra-curricular activities.\n5 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelop your consultancy skills on the AGCAS award nominated Internationalisation Challenge module, as well as the Individual MBA Challenge, collaborating with local clients to drive global impact. Continue developing your understanding of a variety of business functions, tailoring the programme to your interests as you select elective modules. The Personal, Professional and Career Development module will continue to elevate your capabilities, equipping you with the tools and insights to excel as you return to the workplace and make a lasting impact on your career.\n\n\n\n Core modules:\n\n\nNew Venture Creation Challenge\n\n\nThis is a project-based module in which, working in small groups, you will research and develop a business plan for a new venture. With facilitation and coaching, you will select an entrepreneurial idea and develop it into a comprehensive and fully detailed written business plan. All aspects of the business must be thoroughly researched and the written plan must include five years of financial projections. The module also considers what it takes to become more entrepreneurial or 'intrapreneurial', by critically considering to what extent it is possible to replicate entrepreneurial DNA. The module considers the importance of organisational leadership, structure, systems, strategies and cultures. The overarching aim is to enable you to assess entrepreneurial orientation and its potential both in theory and practice.\n10 credits\n\n\nStrategic Management\n\n\nThis module examines what we mean by organisational strategy and how strategy is realised in organisations. Strategy can be conceived as the direction and scope of an organisation over the long term and also as an organizational activity and set of practices to do with, for example, strategic analysis and strategic planning as well as processes of negotiation and persuasion. Strategic management entails making distinctive choices that are consequential for the long-term direction, scope and survival of an organisation - often in a turbulent environment, with rapid economic, regulatory, technological, ecological and social changes. Furthermore, strategy formation, implementation, and change involve not just top management, but a variety of organizational members and external stakeholders. On this module you will engage with this complexity through a set of lectures, class discussion and debate, case analysis, and reflection on your experience, with the aim of developing your ability to critically deploy key theories and frameworks to diagnose strategic issues and make informed strategic decisions.\n10 credits\n\n\nEffective and Responsible Leadership\n\n\nThe need for effective and responsible leadership has never been greater, with the ethics and sustainability of organisational practices becoming increasingly scrutinised. Consequently, leading ethically and responsibly is crucial for the financial and socio-ecological sustainability of organisations. This module will explore perspectives on leadership to consider the meanings and practices of leading effectively and responsibly in different contexts. By undertaking a range of classroom activities and developing a reflective portfolio, you will learn to critically reflect on your and others' leadership and followership in order to develop your abilities.\n10 credits\n\n\nInternationalisation Challenge\n\n\nThis module focuses on international business opportunities and the processes, strategies and theories that entrepreneurs, and managers need to follow and apply to pursue them. The primary disciplines for this module are international business, strategy and entrepreneurship which are brought together around the idea that to pursue international opportunities, the firm needs to internationalise, and understand how to do so strategically and effectively. The aim of this module is to enable students to understand and integrate theory and apply it to interpretation and analysis in very specific firm and country contexts, to generate theoretical understanding and practical outcomes for a specified firm.\n10 credits\n\n\nIndividual MBA Challenge\n\n\nThis is an individual project taken towards the end of the Sheffield MBA programme and allows the student to demonstrate the ability to research a management issue within an academic framework and within the context of a specific organisation or industry. It utilises knowledge and skills acquired in the earlier part of the programme, and is executed under the general guidance of a supervisor. The module will also equip students with the frameworks and approaches needed while researching in the field of Management. A dissertation written by the student should be delivered to the School at the conclusion.\n45 credits\n\n\nPersonal, Professional and Career Development\n\n\nThe Personal, Professional and Career Development (PPCD) module is an integral element in the MBA journey, which runs throughout your MBA programme. It is designed to help you cultivate your self awareness and develop the skills needed to achieve your personal, professional and career development goals. This involves personal development and career planning, and setting objectives and identifying strategies to achieve them. The personal element will encompass, for example, self-awareness, self-care, wellbeing, and defining what success means. The professional element is concerned with development activities linked to professionalism and leadership skills development. The career element of this module involves supporting you in achieving your career aspirations which might extend beyond one particular employer or entrepreneurial venture.  These skills include, for example, networking, team working, negotiation, interview skills, etc. The delivery of this module will be through a wide range of in-class learning, interactive sessions led by experts, industry visits and extra-curricular activities.\n5 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n You will select 2 of the 4 elective modules:\n\n\nHuman Resource Management\n\n\nThis module has three objectives.  It is intended to develop an understanding of the international and comparative factors (such as national culture) that shape human resource management.  It will also build functional knowledge of the main tools and techniques used in the HRM field.  Finally, it will develop an awareness of some of the most pertinent HRM issues in Europe, the Far East and America.  Teaching methods for the option will combine the project method, formal lectures, videos, case study analysis, analysis of example HRM tools and techniques and Powerpoint presentations.\n10 credits\n\n\nStrategic Management Accounting\n\n\nThis module explores the way in which management accounting information can play an important role in the strategic development of organisations. It recognises the need for management accounting to be more externally focussed and for it to provide information that helps organisations face up to strategic uncertainties. The concept of strategic management accounting is relevant for both private and public sector organisations.\n10 credits\n\n\nCorporate Finance\n\n\nThis module examines how corporate decision-makers determine policies on funding and firm investment choices. It assesses both areas by scrutinizing background theory and real applications. The module addresses some of the pivotal areas of concern for financial decision-makers, including the formulation of recommendations and policies on investment appraisal, corporate leverage, dividend policy, stock buy-backs, risk management, and CSR-engagement. The module will address such issues within the context of perfect (frictionless) and imperfect market settings and will also stress the role of external capital markets (debt and equity) in relation to the growth cycle of a listed firm.\n10 credits\n\n\nOrganisational Crisis Management\n\n\nCrisis management is an emerging area of management research and practice reflecting the growing scope and scale for organisational disruptions. This module adopts a processual and broad systems perspective to understanding how crises can emerge in organisations and how best managers might prepare for, mitigate and manage these. This is an integrative module which draws upon multi-disciplinary perspectives to provide learners with conceptual insights and analytical tools needed to be effective managers. The teaching strategy is underpinned by case studies developed by the module leader and others. This approach allows students to enhance their critical and analytical skills by evaluating real world management practice and developing their own crisis management abilities through formulating appropriate strategic and operational responses.\n10 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content of our courses is reviewed annually to make sure it's up-to-date and relevant.

You will apply teachings from the Professional, Personal and Career Development module to build real relationships and expand your professional network, laying the foundations for success as you embark on your MBA journey. \n\n\n\n Core modules:\n\n\nAccounting and Financial Management\n\n\nAs managers in businesses, social enterprises or governmental organisations, an ability to interpret accounting reports and exercise financial judgment is essential. The aim of the module is to equip non-financial students with an appropriate level of financial competence - and confidence - and hence view accounting and financial management from the perspective of general management: that is, as users of financial information. This means that learning does not take the form of a series of textbook technical exercises, but grasps concepts and applies them to the real world, as demonstrated on the case company. The accounting element of the module is concerned primarily with the usefulness and limitations of accounting and market data in published financial statements, governance and internal reports and controls, business planning, operational decisions, pricing decisions, and performance management. The financial management element of the module examines the role of accounting and market data to support financing decisions, investing decisions and cash and working capital management.\n10 credits\n\n\nManaging Organisational Behaviour\n\n\nThis unit aims to provide students with an understanding of a systematic set of behavioural science concepts for analysing human behaviour in organisations.  The major theories and research findings in this area derive from the academic disciplines of psychology, sociology and anthropology and students will be expected to familiarise themselves as directed.  Further, the unit provides the opportunity to relate these theoretical concepts to realistic organisational problems and to consider appropriate managerial responses.  In this way, the unit is designed not only to increase the ability to analyse behaviour but also to develop the skill to draw on appropriate concepts to influence and manage others effectively in organisational contexts.\n10 credits\n\n\nOperations Management\n\n\nThis module is concerned with the effective and efficient marshalling of the organisation's resources to meet its objectives. An understanding of fundamental concepts and techniques will be provided and used by students to tackle cases which apply to manufacturing and service industries in both private and public sectors. The systematic and logical approach of Operational Research to the solution of management problems is also introduced.\n10 credits\n\n\nGlobal Managerial Economics\n\n\nThis module focuses on the analysis of factors that affect strategic decisions and performance of firms from an economic perspective. This includes organisation-level factors and issues such as the contractual relationships among the different stakeholders of firms and optimal boundaries of firms, as well as the structure and contestability of markets within which they operate. There is particular emphasis on strategic interactions with competitors, designing of contracts in an environment of imperfect (asymmetric) information, and the role of transactions cost in influencing key strategic decisions  involving both domestic and international operations of firms. Finally, there is discussion about the factors that influence the regulatory and macroeconomic contexts in which firms operate, including the relevance of interconnectedness of economies for domestic macroeconomic and regulatory environments. As such, the aim of the module is to provide a coherent picture of application of economic principles to different aspects of managerial decision making.\n10 credits\n\n\nThe Intelligent Organisation\n\n\nAn intelligent organisation strategically harnesses data and disruptive technologies to achieve its overarching objectives. The insights generated from extensive internal and external data pools empower organisations to operate with enhanced effectiveness and efficiency. For example, Big Data Analytics helps organisations to identify new opportunities and predict future scenarios. Simultaneously, disruptive technologies like Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things further strengthen data-driven organisations by automating underlying business processes. This module therefore focuses on how data and disruptive technologies enable organisations to achieve high levels of digital transformation. It also provides insights into how to assess the readiness for digital transformation and the challenges of delivering digital transformation projects. This module uses interactive lectures, hands-on sessions, guest lectures from industry experts, and case studies to introduce core concepts and their uses in the real world.\n10 credits\n\n\nMarketing Consultancy Challenge\n\n\nThis module integrates consulting with marketing through application on a real company project. You will become familiar with the marketing process, the practice and critical importance of marketing as well as important managerial decisions including those about the choice of the target market, the nature of the offerings and marketing strategies that are aimed at communicating and delivering values. While marketing will provide a set of principles and context, consultancy will provide students with an opportunity to apply theoretically grounded consulting principles into a client based marketing problem. The rationale is that many business consulting projects are driven by the initial need for improvement in markets, products and channels to customers, branding, the design of associated processes etc.\n20 credits\n\n\nPersonal, Professional and Career Development\n\n\nThe Personal, Professional and Career Development (PPCD) module is an integral element in the MBA journey, which runs throughout your MBA programme. It is designed to help you cultivate your self awareness and develop the skills needed to achieve your personal, professional and career development goals. This involves personal development and career planning, and setting objectives and identifying strategies to achieve them. The personal element will encompass, for example, self-awareness, self-care, wellbeing, and defining what success means. The professional element is concerned with development activities linked to professionalism and leadership skills development. The career element of this module involves supporting you in achieving your career aspirations which might extend beyond one particular employer or entrepreneurial venture.  These skills include, for example, networking, team working, negotiation, interview skills, etc. The delivery of this module will be through a wide range of in-class learning, interactive sessions led by experts, industry visits and extra-curricular activities.\n5 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelop your consultancy skills on the AGCAS award nominated Internationalisation Challenge module, as well as the Individual MBA Challenge, collaborating with local clients to drive global impact. Continue developing your understanding of a variety of business functions, tailoring the programme to your interests as you select elective modules. The Personal, Professional and Career Development module will continue to elevate your capabilities, equipping you with the tools and insights to excel as you return to the workplace and make a lasting impact on your career.\n\n\n\n Core modules:\n\n\nNew Venture Creation Challenge\n\n\nThis is a project-based module in which, working in small groups, you will research and develop a business plan for a new venture. With facilitation and coaching, you will select an entrepreneurial idea and develop it into a comprehensive and fully detailed written business plan. All aspects of the business must be thoroughly researched and the written plan must include five years of financial projections. The module also considers what it takes to become more entrepreneurial or 'intrapreneurial', by critically considering to what extent it is possible to replicate entrepreneurial DNA. The module considers the importance of organisational leadership, structure, systems, strategies and cultures. The overarching aim is to enable you to assess entrepreneurial orientation and its potential both in theory and practice.\n10 credits\n\n\nStrategic Management\n\n\nThis module examines what we mean by organisational strategy and how strategy is realised in organisations. Strategy can be conceived as the direction and scope of an organisation over the long term and also as an organizational activity and set of practices to do with, for example, strategic analysis and strategic planning as well as processes of negotiation and persuasion. Strategic management entails making distinctive choices that are consequential for the long-term direction, scope and survival of an organisation - often in a turbulent environment, with rapid economic, regulatory, technological, ecological and social changes. Furthermore, strategy formation, implementation, and change involve not just top management, but a variety of organizational members and external stakeholders. On this module you will engage with this complexity through a set of lectures, class discussion and debate, case analysis, and reflection on your experience, with the aim of developing your ability to critically deploy key theories and frameworks to diagnose strategic issues and make informed strategic decisions.\n10 credits\n\n\nEffective and Responsible Leadership\n\n\nThe need for effective and responsible leadership has never been greater, with the ethics and sustainability of organisational practices becoming increasingly scrutinised. Consequently, leading ethically and responsibly is crucial for the financial and socio-ecological sustainability of organisations. This module will explore perspectives on leadership to consider the meanings and practices of leading effectively and responsibly in different contexts. By undertaking a range of classroom activities and developing a reflective portfolio, you will learn to critically reflect on your and others' leadership and followership in order to develop your abilities.\n10 credits\n\n\nInternationalisation Challenge\n\n\nThis module focuses on international business opportunities and the processes, strategies and theories that entrepreneurs, and managers need to follow and apply to pursue them. The primary disciplines for this module are international business, strategy and entrepreneurship which are brought together around the idea that to pursue international opportunities, the firm needs to internationalise, and understand how to do so strategically and effectively. The aim of this module is to enable students to understand and integrate theory and apply it to interpretation and analysis in very specific firm and country contexts, to generate theoretical understanding and practical outcomes for a specified firm.\n10 credits\n\n\nIndividual MBA Challenge\n\n\nThis is an individual project taken towards the end of the Sheffield MBA programme and allows the student to demonstrate the ability to research a management issue within an academic framework and within the context of a specific organisation or industry. It utilises knowledge and skills acquired in the earlier part of the programme, and is executed under the general guidance of a supervisor. The module will also equip students with the frameworks and approaches needed while researching in the field of Management. A dissertation written by the student should be delivered to the School at the conclusion.\n45 credits\n\n\nPersonal, Professional and Career Development\n\n\nThe Personal, Professional and Career Development (PPCD) module is an integral element in the MBA journey, which runs throughout your MBA programme. It is designed to help you cultivate your self awareness and develop the skills needed to achieve your personal, professional and career development goals. This involves personal development and career planning, and setting objectives and identifying strategies to achieve them. The personal element will encompass, for example, self-awareness, self-care, wellbeing, and defining what success means. The professional element is concerned with development activities linked to professionalism and leadership skills development. The career element of this module involves supporting you in achieving your career aspirations which might extend beyond one particular employer or entrepreneurial venture.  These skills include, for example, networking, team working, negotiation, interview skills, etc. The delivery of this module will be through a wide range of in-class learning, interactive sessions led by experts, industry visits and extra-curricular activities.\n5 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n You will select 2 of the 4 elective modules:\n\n\nHuman Resource Management\n\n\nThis module has three objectives.  It is intended to develop an understanding of the international and comparative factors (such as national culture) that shape human resource management.  It will also build functional knowledge of the main tools and techniques used in the HRM field.  Finally, it will develop an awareness of some of the most pertinent HRM issues in Europe, the Far East and America.  Teaching methods for the option will combine the project method, formal lectures, videos, case study analysis, analysis of example HRM tools and techniques and Powerpoint presentations.\n10 credits\n\n\nStrategic Management Accounting\n\n\nThis module explores the way in which management accounting information can play an important role in the strategic development of organisations. It recognises the need for management accounting to be more externally focussed and for it to provide information that helps organisations face up to strategic uncertainties. The concept of strategic management accounting is relevant for both private and public sector organisations.\n10 credits\n\n\nCorporate Finance\n\n\nThis module examines how corporate decision-makers determine policies on funding and firm investment choices. It assesses both areas by scrutinizing background theory and real applications. The module addresses some of the pivotal areas of concern for financial decision-makers, including the formulation of recommendations and policies on investment appraisal, corporate leverage, dividend policy, stock buy-backs, risk management, and CSR-engagement. The module will address such issues within the context of perfect (frictionless) and imperfect market settings and will also stress the role of external capital markets (debt and equity) in relation to the growth cycle of a listed firm.\n10 credits\n\n\nOrganisational Crisis Management\n\n\nCrisis management is an emerging area of management research and practice reflecting the growing scope and scale for organisational disruptions. This module adopts a processual and broad systems perspective to understanding how crises can emerge in organisations and how best managers might prepare for, mitigate and manage these. This is an integrative module which draws upon multi-disciplinary perspectives to provide learners with conceptual insights and analytical tools needed to be effective managers. The teaching strategy is underpinned by case studies developed by the module leader and others. This approach allows students to enhance their critical and analytical skills by evaluating real world management practice and developing their own crisis management abilities through formulating appropriate strategic and operational responses.\n10 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content of our courses is reviewed annually to make sure it's up-to-date and relevant.

The accounting element of the module is concerned primarily with the usefulness and limitations of accounting and market data in published financial statements, governance and internal reports and controls, business planning, operational decisions, pricing decisions, and performance management. The financial management element of the module examines the role of accounting and market data to support financing decisions, investing decisions and cash and working capital management.\n10 credits\n\n\nManaging Organisational Behaviour\n\n\nThis unit aims to provide students with an understanding of a systematic set of behavioural science concepts for analysing human behaviour in organisations.  The major theories and research findings in this area derive from the academic disciplines of psychology, sociology and anthropology and students will be expected to familiarise themselves as directed.  Further, the unit provides the opportunity to relate these theoretical concepts to realistic organisational problems and to consider appropriate managerial responses.  In this way, the unit is designed not only to increase the ability to analyse behaviour but also to develop the skill to draw on appropriate concepts to influence and manage others effectively in organisational contexts.\n10 credits\n\n\nOperations Management\n\n\nThis module is concerned with the effective and efficient marshalling of the organisation's resources to meet its objectives. An understanding of fundamental concepts and techniques will be provided and used by students to tackle cases which apply to manufacturing and service industries in both private and public sectors. The systematic and logical approach of Operational Research to the solution of management problems is also introduced.\n10 credits\n\n\nGlobal Managerial Economics\n\n\nThis module focuses on the analysis of factors that affect strategic decisions and performance of firms from an economic perspective. This includes organisation-level factors and issues such as the contractual relationships among the different stakeholders of firms and optimal boundaries of firms, as well as the structure and contestability of markets within which they operate. There is particular emphasis on strategic interactions with competitors, designing of contracts in an environment of imperfect (asymmetric) information, and the role of transactions cost in influencing key strategic decisions  involving both domestic and international operations of firms. Finally, there is discussion about the factors that influence the regulatory and macroeconomic contexts in which firms operate, including the relevance of interconnectedness of economies for domestic macroeconomic and regulatory environments. As such, the aim of the module is to provide a coherent picture of application of economic principles to different aspects of managerial decision making.\n10 credits\n\n\nThe Intelligent Organisation\n\n\nAn intelligent organisation strategically harnesses data and disruptive technologies to achieve its overarching objectives. The insights generated from extensive internal and external data pools empower organisations to operate with enhanced effectiveness and efficiency. For example, Big Data Analytics helps organisations to identify new opportunities and predict future scenarios. Simultaneously, disruptive technologies like Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things further strengthen data-driven organisations by automating underlying business processes. This module therefore focuses on how data and disruptive technologies enable organisations to achieve high levels of digital transformation. It also provides insights into how to assess the readiness for digital transformation and the challenges of delivering digital transformation projects. This module uses interactive lectures, hands-on sessions, guest lectures from industry experts, and case studies to introduce core concepts and their uses in the real world.\n10 credits\n\n\nMarketing Consultancy Challenge\n\n\nThis module integrates consulting with marketing through application on a real company project. You will become familiar with the marketing process, the practice and critical importance of marketing as well as important managerial decisions including those about the choice of the target market, the nature of the offerings and marketing strategies that are aimed at communicating and delivering values. While marketing will provide a set of principles and context, consultancy will provide students with an opportunity to apply theoretically grounded consulting principles into a client based marketing problem. The rationale is that many business consulting projects are driven by the initial need for improvement in markets, products and channels to customers, branding, the design of associated processes etc.\n20 credits\n\n\nPersonal, Professional and Career Development\n\n\nThe Personal, Professional and Career Development (PPCD) module is an integral element in the MBA journey, which runs throughout your MBA programme. It is designed to help you cultivate your self awareness and develop the skills needed to achieve your personal, professional and career development goals. This involves personal development and career planning, and setting objectives and identifying strategies to achieve them. The personal element will encompass, for example, self-awareness, self-care, wellbeing, and defining what success means. The professional element is concerned with development activities linked to professionalism and leadership skills development. The career element of this module involves supporting you in achieving your career aspirations which might extend beyond one particular employer or entrepreneurial venture.  These skills include, for example, networking, team working, negotiation, interview skills, etc. The delivery of this module will be through a wide range of in-class learning, interactive sessions led by experts, industry visits and extra-curricular activities.\n5 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelop your consultancy skills on the AGCAS award nominated Internationalisation Challenge module, as well as the Individual MBA Challenge, collaborating with local clients to drive global impact. Continue developing your understanding of a variety of business functions, tailoring the programme to your interests as you select elective modules. The Personal, Professional and Career Development module will continue to elevate your capabilities, equipping you with the tools and insights to excel as you return to the workplace and make a lasting impact on your career.\n\n\n\n Core modules:\n\n\nNew Venture Creation Challenge\n\n\nThis is a project-based module in which, working in small groups, you will research and develop a business plan for a new venture. With facilitation and coaching, you will select an entrepreneurial idea and develop it into a comprehensive and fully detailed written business plan. All aspects of the business must be thoroughly researched and the written plan must include five years of financial projections. The module also considers what it takes to become more entrepreneurial or 'intrapreneurial', by critically considering to what extent it is possible to replicate entrepreneurial DNA. The module considers the importance of organisational leadership, structure, systems, strategies and cultures. The overarching aim is to enable you to assess entrepreneurial orientation and its potential both in theory and practice.\n10 credits\n\n\nStrategic Management\n\n\nThis module examines what we mean by organisational strategy and how strategy is realised in organisations. Strategy can be conceived as the direction and scope of an organisation over the long term and also as an organizational activity and set of practices to do with, for example, strategic analysis and strategic planning as well as processes of negotiation and persuasion. Strategic management entails making distinctive choices that are consequential for the long-term direction, scope and survival of an organisation - often in a turbulent environment, with rapid economic, regulatory, technological, ecological and social changes. Furthermore, strategy formation, implementation, and change involve not just top management, but a variety of organizational members and external stakeholders. On this module you will engage with this complexity through a set of lectures, class discussion and debate, case analysis, and reflection on your experience, with the aim of developing your ability to critically deploy key theories and frameworks to diagnose strategic issues and make informed strategic decisions.\n10 credits\n\n\nEffective and Responsible Leadership\n\n\nThe need for effective and responsible leadership has never been greater, with the ethics and sustainability of organisational practices becoming increasingly scrutinised. Consequently, leading ethically and responsibly is crucial for the financial and socio-ecological sustainability of organisations. This module will explore perspectives on leadership to consider the meanings and practices of leading effectively and responsibly in different contexts. By undertaking a range of classroom activities and developing a reflective portfolio, you will learn to critically reflect on your and others' leadership and followership in order to develop your abilities.\n10 credits\n\n\nInternationalisation Challenge\n\n\nThis module focuses on international business opportunities and the processes, strategies and theories that entrepreneurs, and managers need to follow and apply to pursue them. The primary disciplines for this module are international business, strategy and entrepreneurship which are brought together around the idea that to pursue international opportunities, the firm needs to internationalise, and understand how to do so strategically and effectively. The aim of this module is to enable students to understand and integrate theory and apply it to interpretation and analysis in very specific firm and country contexts, to generate theoretical understanding and practical outcomes for a specified firm.\n10 credits\n\n\nIndividual MBA Challenge\n\n\nThis is an individual project taken towards the end of the Sheffield MBA programme and allows the student to demonstrate the ability to research a management issue within an academic framework and within the context of a specific organisation or industry. It utilises knowledge and skills acquired in the earlier part of the programme, and is executed under the general guidance of a supervisor. The module will also equip students with the frameworks and approaches needed while researching in the field of Management. A dissertation written by the student should be delivered to the School at the conclusion.\n45 credits\n\n\nPersonal, Professional and Career Development\n\n\nThe Personal, Professional and Career Development (PPCD) module is an integral element in the MBA journey, which runs throughout your MBA programme. It is designed to help you cultivate your self awareness and develop the skills needed to achieve your personal, professional and career development goals. This involves personal development and career planning, and setting objectives and identifying strategies to achieve them. The personal element will encompass, for example, self-awareness, self-care, wellbeing, and defining what success means. The professional element is concerned with development activities linked to professionalism and leadership skills development. The career element of this module involves supporting you in achieving your career aspirations which might extend beyond one particular employer or entrepreneurial venture.  These skills include, for example, networking, team working, negotiation, interview skills, etc. The delivery of this module will be through a wide range of in-class learning, interactive sessions led by experts, industry visits and extra-curricular activities.\n5 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n You will select 2 of the 4 elective modules:\n\n\nHuman Resource Management\n\n\nThis module has three objectives.  It is intended to develop an understanding of the international and comparative factors (such as national culture) that shape human resource management.  It will also build functional knowledge of the main tools and techniques used in the HRM field.  Finally, it will develop an awareness of some of the most pertinent HRM issues in Europe, the Far East and America.  Teaching methods for the option will combine the project method, formal lectures, videos, case study analysis, analysis of example HRM tools and techniques and Powerpoint presentations.\n10 credits\n\n\nStrategic Management Accounting\n\n\nThis module explores the way in which management accounting information can play an important role in the strategic development of organisations. It recognises the need for management accounting to be more externally focussed and for it to provide information that helps organisations face up to strategic uncertainties. The concept of strategic management accounting is relevant for both private and public sector organisations.\n10 credits\n\n\nCorporate Finance\n\n\nThis module examines how corporate decision-makers determine policies on funding and firm investment choices. It assesses both areas by scrutinizing background theory and real applications. The module addresses some of the pivotal areas of concern for financial decision-makers, including the formulation of recommendations and policies on investment appraisal, corporate leverage, dividend policy, stock buy-backs, risk management, and CSR-engagement. The module will address such issues within the context of perfect (frictionless) and imperfect market settings and will also stress the role of external capital markets (debt and equity) in relation to the growth cycle of a listed firm.\n10 credits\n\n\nOrganisational Crisis Management\n\n\nCrisis management is an emerging area of management research and practice reflecting the growing scope and scale for organisational disruptions. This module adopts a processual and broad systems perspective to understanding how crises can emerge in organisations and how best managers might prepare for, mitigate and manage these. This is an integrative module which draws upon multi-disciplinary perspectives to provide learners with conceptual insights and analytical tools needed to be effective managers. The teaching strategy is underpinned by case studies developed by the module leader and others. This approach allows students to enhance their critical and analytical skills by evaluating real world management practice and developing their own crisis management abilities through formulating appropriate strategic and operational responses.\n10 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content of our courses is reviewed annually to make sure it's up-to-date and relevant.

Strategy can be conceived as the direction and scope of an organisation over the long term and also as an organizational activity and set of practices to do with, for example, strategic analysis and strategic planning as well as processes of negotiation and persuasion. Strategic management entails making distinctive choices that are consequential for the long-term direction, scope and survival of an organisation - often in a turbulent environment, with rapid economic, regulatory, technological, ecological and social changes. Furthermore, strategy formation, implementation, and change involve not just top management, but a variety of organizational members and external stakeholders. On this module you will engage with this complexity through a set of lectures, class discussion and debate, case analysis, and reflection on your experience, with the aim of developing your ability to critically deploy key theories and frameworks to diagnose strategic issues and make informed strategic decisions.\n10 credits\n\n\nEffective and Responsible Leadership\n\n\nThe need for effective and responsible leadership has never been greater, with the ethics and sustainability of organisational practices becoming increasingly scrutinised. Consequently, leading ethically and responsibly is crucial for the financial and socio-ecological sustainability of organisations. This module will explore perspectives on leadership to consider the meanings and practices of leading effectively and responsibly in different contexts. By undertaking a range of classroom activities and developing a reflective portfolio, you will learn to critically reflect on your and others' leadership and followership in order to develop your abilities.\n10 credits\n\n\nInternationalisation Challenge\n\n\nThis module focuses on international business opportunities and the processes, strategies and theories that entrepreneurs, and managers need to follow and apply to pursue them. The primary disciplines for this module are international business, strategy and entrepreneurship which are brought together around the idea that to pursue international opportunities, the firm needs to internationalise, and understand how to do so strategically and effectively. The aim of this module is to enable students to understand and integrate theory and apply it to interpretation and analysis in very specific firm and country contexts, to generate theoretical understanding and practical outcomes for a specified firm.\n10 credits\n\n\nIndividual MBA Challenge\n\n\nThis is an individual project taken towards the end of the Sheffield MBA programme and allows the student to demonstrate the ability to research a management issue within an academic framework and within the context of a specific organisation or industry. It utilises knowledge and skills acquired in the earlier part of the programme, and is executed under the general guidance of a supervisor. The module will also equip students with the frameworks and approaches needed while researching in the field of Management. A dissertation written by the student should be delivered to the School at the conclusion.\n45 credits\n\n\nPersonal, Professional and Career Development\n\n\nThe Personal, Professional and Career Development (PPCD) module is an integral element in the MBA journey, which runs throughout your MBA programme. It is designed to help you cultivate your self awareness and develop the skills needed to achieve your personal, professional and career development goals. This involves personal development and career planning, and setting objectives and identifying strategies to achieve them. The personal element will encompass, for example, self-awareness, self-care, wellbeing, and defining what success means. The professional element is concerned with development activities linked to professionalism and leadership skills development. The career element of this module involves supporting you in achieving your career aspirations which might extend beyond one particular employer or entrepreneurial venture.  These skills include, for example, networking, team working, negotiation, interview skills, etc. The delivery of this module will be through a wide range of in-class learning, interactive sessions led by experts, industry visits and extra-curricular activities.\n5 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n You will select 2 of the 4 elective modules:\n\n\nHuman Resource Management\n\n\nThis module has three objectives.

Finally, it will develop an awareness of some of the most pertinent HRM issues in Europe, the Far East and America.  Teaching methods for the option will combine the project method, formal lectures, videos, case study analysis, analysis of example HRM tools and techniques and Powerpoint presentations.\n10 credits\n\n\nStrategic Management Accounting\n\n\nThis module explores the way in which management accounting information can play an important role in the strategic development of organisations. It recognises the need for management accounting to be more externally focussed and for it to provide information that helps organisations face up to strategic uncertainties. The concept of strategic management accounting is relevant for both private and public sector organisations.\n10 credits\n\n\nCorporate Finance\n\n\nThis module examines how corporate decision-makers determine policies on funding and firm investment choices. It assesses both areas by scrutinizing background theory and real applications. The module addresses some of the pivotal areas of concern for financial decision-makers, including the formulation of recommendations and policies on investment appraisal, corporate leverage, dividend policy, stock buy-backs, risk management, and CSR-engagement. The module will address such issues within the context of perfect (frictionless) and imperfect market settings and will also stress the role of external capital markets (debt and equity) in relation to the growth cycle of a listed firm.\n10 credits\n\n\nOrganisational Crisis Management\n\n\nCrisis management is an emerging area of management research and practice reflecting the growing scope and scale for organisational disruptions. This module adopts a processual and broad systems perspective to understanding how crises can emerge in organisations and how best managers might prepare for, mitigate and manage these. This is an integrative module which draws upon multi-disciplinary perspectives to provide learners with conceptual insights and analytical tools needed to be effective managers. The teaching strategy is underpinned by case studies developed by the module leader and others. This approach allows students to enhance their critical and analytical skills by evaluating real world management practice and developing their own crisis management abilities through formulating appropriate strategic and operational responses.\n10 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content of our courses is reviewed annually to make sure it's up-to-date and relevant.

The aim of the module is to equip non-financial students with an appropriate level of financial competence - and confidence - and hence view accounting and financial management from the perspective of general management: that is, as users of financial information. This means that learning does not take the form of a series of textbook technical exercises, but grasps concepts and applies them to the real world, as demonstrated on the case company. The accounting element of the module is concerned primarily with the usefulness and limitations of accounting and market data in published financial statements, governance and internal reports and controls, business planning, operational decisions, pricing decisions, and performance management. The financial management element of the module examines the role of accounting and market data to support financing decisions, investing decisions and cash and working capital management.\n10 credits\n\n\nManaging Organisational Behaviour\n\n\nThis unit aims to provide students with an understanding of a systematic set of behavioural science concepts for analysing human behaviour in organisations.  The major theories and research findings in this area derive from the academic disciplines of psychology, sociology and anthropology and students will be expected to familiarise themselves as directed.  Further, the unit provides the opportunity to relate these theoretical concepts to realistic organisational problems and to consider appropriate managerial responses.  In this way, the unit is designed not only to increase the ability to analyse behaviour but also to develop the skill to draw on appropriate concepts to influence and manage others effectively in organisational contexts.\n10 credits\n\n\nOperations Management\n\n\nThis module is concerned with the effective and efficient marshalling of the organisation's resources to meet its objectives. An understanding of fundamental concepts and techniques will be provided and used by students to tackle cases which apply to manufacturing and service industries in both private and public sectors. The systematic and logical approach of Operational Research to the solution of management problems is also introduced.\n10 credits\n\n\nGlobal Managerial Economics\n\n\nThis module focuses on the analysis of factors that affect strategic decisions and performance of firms from an economic perspective. This includes organisation-level factors and issues such as the contractual relationships among the different stakeholders of firms and optimal boundaries of firms, as well as the structure and contestability of markets within which they operate. There is particular emphasis on strategic interactions with competitors, designing of contracts in an environment of imperfect (asymmetric) information, and the role of transactions cost in influencing key strategic decisions  involving both domestic and international operations of firms. Finally, there is discussion about the factors that influence the regulatory and macroeconomic contexts in which firms operate, including the relevance of interconnectedness of economies for domestic macroeconomic and regulatory environments. As such, the aim of the module is to provide a coherent picture of application of economic principles to different aspects of managerial decision making.\n10 credits\n\n\nThe Intelligent Organisation\n\n\nAn intelligent organisation strategically harnesses data and disruptive technologies to achieve its overarching objectives. The insights generated from extensive internal and external data pools empower organisations to operate with enhanced effectiveness and efficiency. For example, Big Data Analytics helps organisations to identify new opportunities and predict future scenarios. Simultaneously, disruptive technologies like Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things further strengthen data-driven organisations by automating underlying business processes. This module therefore focuses on how data and disruptive technologies enable organisations to achieve high levels of digital transformation. It also provides insights into how to assess the readiness for digital transformation and the challenges of delivering digital transformation projects. This module uses interactive lectures, hands-on sessions, guest lectures from industry experts, and case studies to introduce core concepts and their uses in the real world.\n10 credits\n\n\nMarketing Consultancy Challenge\n\n\nThis module integrates consulting with marketing through application on a real company project. You will become familiar with the marketing process, the practice and critical importance of marketing as well as important managerial decisions including those about the choice of the target market, the nature of the offerings and marketing strategies that are aimed at communicating and delivering values. While marketing will provide a set of principles and context, consultancy will provide students with an opportunity to apply theoretically grounded consulting principles into a client based marketing problem. The rationale is that many business consulting projects are driven by the initial need for improvement in markets, products and channels to customers, branding, the design of associated processes etc.\n20 credits\n\n\nPersonal, Professional and Career Development\n\n\nThe Personal, Professional and Career Development (PPCD) module is an integral element in the MBA journey, which runs throughout your MBA programme. It is designed to help you cultivate your self awareness and develop the skills needed to achieve your personal, professional and career development goals. This involves personal development and career planning, and setting objectives and identifying strategies to achieve them. The personal element will encompass, for example, self-awareness, self-care, wellbeing, and defining what success means. The professional element is concerned with development activities linked to professionalism and leadership skills development. The career element of this module involves supporting you in achieving your career aspirations which might extend beyond one particular employer or entrepreneurial venture.  These skills include, for example, networking, team working, negotiation, interview skills, etc. The delivery of this module will be through a wide range of in-class learning, interactive sessions led by experts, industry visits and extra-curricular activities.\n5 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelop your consultancy skills on the AGCAS award nominated Internationalisation Challenge module, as well as the Individual MBA Challenge, collaborating with local clients to drive global impact. Continue developing your understanding of a variety of business functions, tailoring the programme to your interests as you select elective modules. The Personal, Professional and Career Development module will continue to elevate your capabilities, equipping you with the tools and insights to excel as you return to the workplace and make a lasting impact on your career.\n\n\n\n Core modules:\n\n\nNew Venture Creation Challenge\n\n\nThis is a project-based module in which, working in small groups, you will research and develop a business plan for a new venture. With facilitation and coaching, you will select an entrepreneurial idea and develop it into a comprehensive and fully detailed written business plan. All aspects of the business must be thoroughly researched and the written plan must include five years of financial projections. The module also considers what it takes to become more entrepreneurial or 'intrapreneurial', by critically considering to what extent it is possible to replicate entrepreneurial DNA. The module considers the importance of organisational leadership, structure, systems, strategies and cultures. The overarching aim is to enable you to assess entrepreneurial orientation and its potential both in theory and practice.\n10 credits\n\n\nStrategic Management\n\n\nThis module examines what we mean by organisational strategy and how strategy is realised in organisations. Strategy can be conceived as the direction and scope of an organisation over the long term and also as an organizational activity and set of practices to do with, for example, strategic analysis and strategic planning as well as processes of negotiation and persuasion. Strategic management entails making distinctive choices that are consequential for the long-term direction, scope and survival of an organisation - often in a turbulent environment, with rapid economic, regulatory, technological, ecological and social changes. Furthermore, strategy formation, implementation, and change involve not just top management, but a variety of organizational members and external stakeholders. On this module you will engage with this complexity through a set of lectures, class discussion and debate, case analysis, and reflection on your experience, with the aim of developing your ability to critically deploy key theories and frameworks to diagnose strategic issues and make informed strategic decisions.\n10 credits\n\n\nEffective and Responsible Leadership\n\n\nThe need for effective and responsible leadership has never been greater, with the ethics and sustainability of organisational practices becoming increasingly scrutinised. Consequently, leading ethically and responsibly is crucial for the financial and socio-ecological sustainability of organisations. This module will explore perspectives on leadership to consider the meanings and practices of leading effectively and responsibly in different contexts. By undertaking a range of classroom activities and developing a reflective portfolio, you will learn to critically reflect on your and others' leadership and followership in order to develop your abilities.\n10 credits\n\n\nInternationalisation Challenge\n\n\nThis module focuses on international business opportunities and the processes, strategies and theories that entrepreneurs, and managers need to follow and apply to pursue them. The primary disciplines for this module are international business, strategy and entrepreneurship which are brought together around the idea that to pursue international opportunities, the firm needs to internationalise, and understand how to do so strategically and effectively. The aim of this module is to enable students to understand and integrate theory and apply it to interpretation and analysis in very specific firm and country contexts, to generate theoretical understanding and practical outcomes for a specified firm.\n10 credits\n\n\nIndividual MBA Challenge\n\n\nThis is an individual project taken towards the end of the Sheffield MBA programme and allows the student to demonstrate the ability to research a management issue within an academic framework and within the context of a specific organisation or industry. It utilises knowledge and skills acquired in the earlier part of the programme, and is executed under the general guidance of a supervisor. The module will also equip students with the frameworks and approaches needed while researching in the field of Management. A dissertation written by the student should be delivered to the School at the conclusion.\n45 credits\n\n\nPersonal, Professional and Career Development\n\n\nThe Personal, Professional and Career Development (PPCD) module is an integral element in the MBA journey, which runs throughout your MBA programme. It is designed to help you cultivate your self awareness and develop the skills needed to achieve your personal, professional and career development goals. This involves personal development and career planning, and setting objectives and identifying strategies to achieve them. The personal element will encompass, for example, self-awareness, self-care, wellbeing, and defining what success means. The professional element is concerned with development activities linked to professionalism and leadership skills development. The career element of this module involves supporting you in achieving your career aspirations which might extend beyond one particular employer or entrepreneurial venture.  These skills include, for example, networking, team working, negotiation, interview skills, etc. The delivery of this module will be through a wide range of in-class learning, interactive sessions led by experts, industry visits and extra-curricular activities.\n5 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n You will select 2 of the 4 elective modules:\n\n\nHuman Resource Management\n\n\nThis module has three objectives.  It is intended to develop an understanding of the international and comparative factors (such as national culture) that shape human resource management.  It will also build functional knowledge of the main tools and techniques used in the HRM field.  Finally, it will develop an awareness of some of the most pertinent HRM issues in Europe, the Far East and America.  Teaching methods for the option will combine the project method, formal lectures, videos, case study analysis, analysis of example HRM tools and techniques and Powerpoint presentations.\n10 credits\n\n\nStrategic Management Accounting\n\n\nThis module explores the way in which management accounting information can play an important role in the strategic development of organisations. It recognises the need for management accounting to be more externally focussed and for it to provide information that helps organisations face up to strategic uncertainties. The concept of strategic management accounting is relevant for both private and public sector organisations.\n10 credits\n\n\nCorporate Finance\n\n\nThis module examines how corporate decision-makers determine policies on funding and firm investment choices.

The aim of the module is to equip non-financial students with an appropriate level of financial competence - and confidence - and hence view accounting and financial management from the perspective of general management: that is, as users of financial information. This means that learning does not take the form of a series of textbook technical exercises, but grasps concepts and applies them to the real world, as demonstrated on the case company. The accounting element of the module is concerned primarily with the usefulness and limitations of accounting and market data in published financial statements, governance and internal reports and controls, business planning, operational decisions, pricing decisions, and performance management. The financial management element of the module examines the role of accounting and market data to support financing decisions, investing decisions and cash and working capital management.\n10 credits\n\n\nManaging Organisational Behaviour\n\n\nThis unit aims to provide students with an understanding of a systematic set of behavioural science concepts for analysing human behaviour in organisations.  The major theories and research findings in this area derive from the academic disciplines of psychology, sociology and anthropology and students will be expected to familiarise themselves as directed.  Further, the unit provides the opportunity to relate these theoretical concepts to realistic organisational problems and to consider appropriate managerial responses.  In this way, the unit is designed not only to increase the ability to analyse behaviour but also to develop the skill to draw on appropriate concepts to influence and manage others effectively in organisational contexts.\n10 credits\n\n\nOperations Management\n\n\nThis module is concerned with the effective and efficient marshalling of the organisation's resources to meet its objectives. An understanding of fundamental concepts and techniques will be provided and used by students to tackle cases which apply to manufacturing and service industries in both private and public sectors. The systematic and logical approach of Operational Research to the solution of management problems is also introduced.\n10 credits\n\n\nGlobal Managerial Economics\n\n\nThis module focuses on the analysis of factors that affect strategic decisions and performance of firms from an economic perspective. This includes organisation-level factors and issues such as the contractual relationships among the different stakeholders of firms and optimal boundaries of firms, as well as the structure and contestability of markets within which they operate. There is particular emphasis on strategic interactions with competitors, designing of contracts in an environment of imperfect (asymmetric) information, and the role of transactions cost in influencing key strategic decisions  involving both domestic and international operations of firms. Finally, there is discussion about the factors that influence the regulatory and macroeconomic contexts in which firms operate, including the relevance of interconnectedness of economies for domestic macroeconomic and regulatory environments. As such, the aim of the module is to provide a coherent picture of application of economic principles to different aspects of managerial decision making.\n10 credits\n\n\nThe Intelligent Organisation\n\n\nAn intelligent organisation strategically harnesses data and disruptive technologies to achieve its overarching objectives. The insights generated from extensive internal and external data pools empower organisations to operate with enhanced effectiveness and efficiency. For example, Big Data Analytics helps organisations to identify new opportunities and predict future scenarios. Simultaneously, disruptive technologies like Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things further strengthen data-driven organisations by automating underlying business processes. This module therefore focuses on how data and disruptive technologies enable organisations to achieve high levels of digital transformation. It also provides insights into how to assess the readiness for digital transformation and the challenges of delivering digital transformation projects. This module uses interactive lectures, hands-on sessions, guest lectures from industry experts, and case studies to introduce core concepts and their uses in the real world.\n10 credits\n\n\nMarketing Consultancy Challenge\n\n\nThis module integrates consulting with marketing through application on a real company project. You will become familiar with the marketing process, the practice and critical importance of marketing as well as important managerial decisions including those about the choice of the target market, the nature of the offerings and marketing strategies that are aimed at communicating and delivering values. While marketing will provide a set of principles and context, consultancy will provide students with an opportunity to apply theoretically grounded consulting principles into a client based marketing problem. The rationale is that many business consulting projects are driven by the initial need for improvement in markets, products and channels to customers, branding, the design of associated processes etc.\n20 credits\n\n\nPersonal, Professional and Career Development\n\n\nThe Personal, Professional and Career Development (PPCD) module is an integral element in the MBA journey, which runs throughout your MBA programme. It is designed to help you cultivate your self awareness and develop the skills needed to achieve your personal, professional and career development goals. This involves personal development and career planning, and setting objectives and identifying strategies to achieve them. The personal element will encompass, for example, self-awareness, self-care, wellbeing, and defining what success means. The professional element is concerned with development activities linked to professionalism and leadership skills development. The career element of this module involves supporting you in achieving your career aspirations which might extend beyond one particular employer or entrepreneurial venture.  These skills include, for example, networking, team working, negotiation, interview skills, etc. The delivery of this module will be through a wide range of in-class learning, interactive sessions led by experts, industry visits and extra-curricular activities.\n5 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelop your consultancy skills on the AGCAS award nominated Internationalisation Challenge module, as well as the Individual MBA Challenge, collaborating with local clients to drive global impact. Continue developing your understanding of a variety of business functions, tailoring the programme to your interests as you select elective modules. The Personal, Professional and Career Development module will continue to elevate your capabilities, equipping you with the tools and insights to excel as you return to the workplace and make a lasting impact on your career.\n\n\n\n Core modules:\n\n\nNew Venture Creation Challenge\n\n\nThis is a project-based module in which, working in small groups, you will research and develop a business plan for a new venture. With facilitation and coaching, you will select an entrepreneurial idea and develop it into a comprehensive and fully detailed written business plan. All aspects of the business must be thoroughly researched and the written plan must include five years of financial projections. The module also considers what it takes to become more entrepreneurial or 'intrapreneurial', by critically considering to what extent it is possible to replicate entrepreneurial DNA. The module considers the importance of organisational leadership, structure, systems, strategies and cultures. The overarching aim is to enable you to assess entrepreneurial orientation and its potential both in theory and practice.\n10 credits\n\n\nStrategic Management\n\n\nThis module examines what we mean by organisational strategy and how strategy is realised in organisations. Strategy can be conceived as the direction and scope of an organisation over the long term and also as an organizational activity and set of practices to do with, for example, strategic analysis and strategic planning as well as processes of negotiation and persuasion. Strategic management entails making distinctive choices that are consequential for the long-term direction, scope and survival of an organisation - often in a turbulent environment, with rapid economic, regulatory, technological, ecological and social changes. Furthermore, strategy formation, implementation, and change involve not just top management, but a variety of organizational members and external stakeholders. On this module you will engage with this complexity through a set of lectures, class discussion and debate, case analysis, and reflection on your experience, with the aim of developing your ability to critically deploy key theories and frameworks to diagnose strategic issues and make informed strategic decisions.\n10 credits\n\n\nEffective and Responsible Leadership\n\n\nThe need for effective and responsible leadership has never been greater, with the ethics and sustainability of organisational practices becoming increasingly scrutinised. Consequently, leading ethically and responsibly is crucial for the financial and socio-ecological sustainability of organisations. This module will explore perspectives on leadership to consider the meanings and practices of leading effectively and responsibly in different contexts. By undertaking a range of classroom activities and developing a reflective portfolio, you will learn to critically reflect on your and others' leadership and followership in order to develop your abilities.\n10 credits\n\n\nInternationalisation Challenge\n\n\nThis module focuses on international business opportunities and the processes, strategies and theories that entrepreneurs, and managers need to follow and apply to pursue them. The primary disciplines for this module are international business, strategy and entrepreneurship which are brought together around the idea that to pursue international opportunities, the firm needs to internationalise, and understand how to do so strategically and effectively. The aim of this module is to enable students to understand and integrate theory and apply it to interpretation and analysis in very specific firm and country contexts, to generate theoretical understanding and practical outcomes for a specified firm.\n10 credits\n\n\nIndividual MBA Challenge\n\n\nThis is an individual project taken towards the end of the Sheffield MBA programme and allows the student to demonstrate the ability to research a management issue within an academic framework and within the context of a specific organisation or industry. It utilises knowledge and skills acquired in the earlier part of the programme, and is executed under the general guidance of a supervisor. The module will also equip students with the frameworks and approaches needed while researching in the field of Management. A dissertation written by the student should be delivered to the School at the conclusion.\n45 credits\n\n\nPersonal, Professional and Career Development\n\n\nThe Personal, Professional and Career Development (PPCD) module is an integral element in the MBA journey, which runs throughout your MBA programme. It is designed to help you cultivate your self awareness and develop the skills needed to achieve your personal, professional and career development goals. This involves personal development and career planning, and setting objectives and identifying strategies to achieve them. The personal element will encompass, for example, self-awareness, self-care, wellbeing, and defining what success means. The professional element is concerned with development activities linked to professionalism and leadership skills development. The career element of this module involves supporting you in achieving your career aspirations which might extend beyond one particular employer or entrepreneurial venture.  These skills include, for example, networking, team working, negotiation, interview skills, etc. The delivery of this module will be through a wide range of in-class learning, interactive sessions led by experts, industry visits and extra-curricular activities.\n5 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n You will select 2 of the 4 elective modules:\n\n\nHuman Resource Management\n\n\nThis module has three objectives.  It is intended to develop an understanding of the international and comparative factors (such as national culture) that shape human resource management.  It will also build functional knowledge of the main tools and techniques used in the HRM field.  Finally, it will develop an awareness of some of the most pertinent HRM issues in Europe, the Far East and America.  Teaching methods for the option will combine the project method, formal lectures, videos, case study analysis, analysis of example HRM tools and techniques and Powerpoint presentations.\n10 credits\n\n\nStrategic Management Accounting\n\n\nThis module explores the way in which management accounting information can play an important role in the strategic development of organisations. It recognises the need for management accounting to be more externally focussed and for it to provide information that helps organisations face up to strategic uncertainties. The concept of strategic management accounting is relevant for both private and public sector organisations.\n10 credits\n\n\nCorporate Finance\n\n\nThis module examines how corporate decision-makers determine policies on funding and firm investment choices. It assesses both areas by scrutinizing background theory and real applications. The module addresses some of the pivotal areas of concern for financial decision-makers, including the formulation of recommendations and policies on investment appraisal, corporate leverage, dividend policy, stock buy-backs, risk management, and CSR-engagement. The module will address such issues within the context of perfect (frictionless) and imperfect market settings and will also stress the role of external capital markets (debt and equity) in relation to the growth cycle of a listed firm.\n10 credits\n\n\nOrganisational Crisis Management\n\n\nCrisis management is an emerging area of management research and practice reflecting the growing scope and scale for organisational disruptions. This module adopts a processual and broad systems perspective to understanding how crises can emerge in organisations and how best managers might prepare for, mitigate and manage these. This is an integrative module which draws upon multi-disciplinary perspectives to provide learners with conceptual insights and analytical tools needed to be effective managers.

The aim of the module is to equip non-financial students with an appropriate level of financial competence - and confidence - and hence view accounting and financial management from the perspective of general management: that is, as users of financial information. This means that learning does not take the form of a series of textbook technical exercises, but grasps concepts and applies them to the real world, as demonstrated on the case company. The accounting element of the module is concerned primarily with the usefulness and limitations of accounting and market data in published financial statements, governance and internal reports and controls, business planning, operational decisions, pricing decisions, and performance management. The financial management element of the module examines the role of accounting and market data to support financing decisions, investing decisions and cash and working capital management.\n10 credits\nManaging Organisational Behaviour: This unit aims to provide students with an understanding of a systematic set of behavioural science concepts for analysing human behaviour in organisations.  The major theories and research findings in this area derive from the academic disciplines of psychology, sociology and anthropology and students will be expected to familiarise themselves as directed.  Further, the unit provides the opportunity to relate these theoretical concepts to realistic organisational problems and to consider appropriate managerial responses.  In this way, the unit is designed not only to increase the ability to analyse behaviour but also to develop the skill to draw on appropriate concepts to influence and manage others effectively in organisational contexts.\n10 credits\nOperations Management: This module is concerned with the effective and efficient marshalling of the organisation's resources to meet its objectives. An understanding of fundamental concepts and techniques will be provided and used by students to tackle cases which apply to manufacturing and service industries in both private and public sectors. The systematic and logical approach of Operational Research to the solution of management problems is also introduced.\n10 credits\nGlobal Managerial Economics: This module focuses on the analysis of factors that affect strategic decisions and performance of firms from an economic perspective. This includes organisation-level factors and issues such as the contractual relationships among the different stakeholders of firms and optimal boundaries of firms, as well as the structure and contestability of markets within which they operate. There is particular emphasis on strategic interactions with competitors, designing of contracts in an environment of imperfect (asymmetric) information, and the role of transactions cost in influencing key strategic decisions  involving both domestic and international operations of firms. Finally, there is discussion about the factors that influence the regulatory and macroeconomic contexts in which firms operate, including the relevance of interconnectedness of economies for domestic macroeconomic and regulatory environments. As such, the aim of the module is to provide a coherent picture of application of economic principles to different aspects of managerial decision making.\n10 credits\nThe Intelligent Organisation: An intelligent organisation strategically harnesses data and disruptive technologies to achieve its overarching objectives. The insights generated from extensive internal and external data pools empower organisations to operate with enhanced effectiveness and efficiency. For example, Big Data Analytics helps organisations to identify new opportunities and predict future scenarios. Simultaneously, disruptive technologies like Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things further strengthen data-driven organisations by automating underlying business processes. This module therefore focuses on how data and disruptive technologies enable organisations to achieve high levels of digital transformation. It also provides insights into how to assess the readiness for digital transformation and the challenges of delivering digital transformation projects. This module uses interactive lectures, hands-on sessions, guest lectures from industry experts, and case studies to introduce core concepts and their uses in the real world.\n10 credits\nMarketing Consultancy Challenge: This module integrates consulting with marketing through application on a real company project. You will become familiar with the marketing process, the practice and critical importance of marketing as well as important managerial decisions including those about the choice of the target market, the nature of the offerings and marketing strategies that are aimed at communicating and delivering values. While marketing will provide a set of principles and context, consultancy will provide students with an opportunity to apply theoretically grounded consulting principles into a client based marketing problem. The rationale is that many business consulting projects are driven by the initial need for improvement in markets, products and channels to customers, branding, the design of associated processes etc.\n20 credits\nPersonal, Professional and Career Development: The Personal, Professional and Career Development (PPCD) module is an integral element in the MBA journey, which runs throughout your MBA programme. It is designed to help you cultivate your self awareness and develop the skills needed to achieve your personal, professional and career development goals. This involves personal development and career planning, and setting objectives and identifying strategies to achieve them. The personal element will encompass, for example, self-awareness, self-care, wellbeing, and defining what success means. The professional element is concerned with development activities linked to professionalism and leadership skills development. The career element of this module involves supporting you in achieving your career aspirations which might extend beyond one particular employer or entrepreneurial venture.  These skills include, for example, networking, team working, negotiation, interview skills, etc. The delivery of this module will be through a wide range of in-class learning, interactive sessions led by experts, industry visits and extra-curricular activities.\n5 credits\n[DEFINITION_LIST]\nNew Venture Creation Challenge: This is a project-based module in which, working in small groups, you will research and develop a business plan for a new venture. With facilitation and coaching, you will select an entrepreneurial idea and develop it into a comprehensive and fully detailed written business plan. All aspects of the business must be thoroughly researched and the written plan must include five years of financial projections. The module also considers what it takes to become more entrepreneurial or 'intrapreneurial', by critically considering to what extent it is possible to replicate entrepreneurial DNA. The module considers the importance of organisational leadership, structure, systems, strategies and cultures. The overarching aim is to enable you to assess entrepreneurial orientation and its potential both in theory and practice.\n10 credits\nStrategic Management: This module examines what we mean by organisational strategy and how strategy is realised in organisations. Strategy can be conceived as the direction and scope of an organisation over the long term and also as an organizational activity and set of practices to do with, for example, strategic analysis and strategic planning as well as processes of negotiation and persuasion. Strategic management entails making distinctive choices that are consequential for the long-term direction, scope and survival of an organisation - often in a turbulent environment, with rapid economic, regulatory, technological, ecological and social changes. Furthermore, strategy formation, implementation, and change involve not just top management, but a variety of organizational members and external stakeholders. On this module you will engage with this complexity through a set of lectures, class discussion and debate, case analysis, and reflection on your experience, with the aim of developing your ability to critically deploy key theories and frameworks to diagnose strategic issues and make informed strategic decisions.\n10 credits\nEffective and Responsible Leadership: The need for effective and responsible leadership has never been greater, with the ethics and sustainability of organisational practices becoming increasingly scrutinised. Consequently, leading ethically and responsibly is crucial for the financial and socio-ecological sustainability of organisations. This module will explore perspectives on leadership to consider the meanings and practices of leading effectively and responsibly in different contexts. By undertaking a range of classroom activities and developing a reflective portfolio, you will learn to critically reflect on your and others' leadership and followership in order to develop your abilities.\n10 credits\nInternationalisation Challenge: This module focuses on international business opportunities and the processes, strategies and theories that entrepreneurs, and managers need to follow and apply to pursue them. The primary disciplines for this module are international business, strategy and entrepreneurship which are brought together around the idea that to pursue international opportunities, the firm needs to internationalise, and understand how to do so strategically and effectively. The aim of this module is to enable students to understand and integrate theory and apply it to interpretation and analysis in very specific firm and country contexts, to generate theoretical understanding and practical outcomes for a specified firm.\n10 credits\nIndividual MBA Challenge: This is an individual project taken towards the end of the Sheffield MBA programme and allows the student to demonstrate the ability to research a management issue within an academic framework and within the context of a specific organisation or industry. It utilises knowledge and skills acquired in the earlier part of the programme, and is executed under the general guidance of a supervisor. The module will also equip students with the frameworks and approaches needed while researching in the field of Management. A dissertation written by the student should be delivered to the School at the conclusion.\n45 credits\nPersonal, Professional and Career Development: The Personal, Professional and Career Development (PPCD) module is an integral element in the MBA journey, which runs throughout your MBA programme. It is designed to help you cultivate your self awareness and develop the skills needed to achieve your personal, professional and career development goals. This involves personal development and career planning, and setting objectives and identifying strategies to achieve them.

The professional element is concerned with development activities linked to professionalism and leadership skills development.

It is intended to develop an understanding of the international and comparative factors (such as national culture) that shape human resource management.  It will also build functional knowledge of the main tools and techniques used in the HRM field.  Finally, it will develop an awareness of some of the most pertinent HRM issues in Europe, the Far East and America.  Teaching methods for the option will combine the project method, formal lectures, videos, case study analysis, analysis of example HRM tools and techniques and Powerpoint presentations.\n10 credits\nStrategic Management Accounting: This module explores the way in which management accounting information can play an important role in the strategic development of organisations. It recognises the need for management accounting to be more externally focussed and for it to provide information that helps organisations face up to strategic uncertainties. The concept of strategic management accounting is relevant for both private and public sector organisations.\n10 credits\nCorporate Finance: This module examines how corporate decision-makers determine policies on funding and firm investment choices. It assesses both areas by scrutinizing background theory and real applications. The module addresses some of the pivotal areas of concern for financial decision-makers, including the formulation of recommendations and policies on investment appraisal, corporate leverage, dividend policy, stock buy-backs, risk management, and CSR-engagement. The module will address such issues within the context of perfect (frictionless) and imperfect market settings and will also stress the role of external capital markets (debt and equity) in relation to the growth cycle of a listed firm.\n10 credits\nOrganisational Crisis Management: Crisis management is an emerging area of management research and practice reflecting the growing scope and scale for organisational disruptions. This module adopts a processual and broad systems perspective to understanding how crises can emerge in organisations and how best managers might prepare for, mitigate and manage these. This is an integrative module which draws upon multi-disciplinary perspectives to provide learners with conceptual insights and analytical tools needed to be effective managers. The teaching strategy is underpinned by case studies developed by the module leader and others. This approach allows students to enhance their critical and analytical skills by evaluating real world management practice and developing their own crisis management abilities through formulating appropriate strategic and operational responses.\n10 credits\n[CARD]\nMBA (Master of Business Administration)\nMBA\n2025-26 entry\nMBA (Master of Business Administration)\nMBA\n\n\n      \n            \n                \n      Management School,\n\n                  Faculty of Social Sciences\n\n\n          Holding prestigious Triple Crown accreditation and Tier One status in CEO Magazine's Global MBA Rankings, the Sheffield MBA is the Management School’s flagship programme and has been running since 1969.\n    \n\n\nStart date\n\n          September 2025\n      \n\nDuration\n\n1 year\n\n\nAttendance\n\nFull-time\n\n\n\n Accredited\n Course fee\n\n\n\nApply for this course\nRegister for updates\n[CARD]\nExplore this course:\n[CARD]\nWe're revising the curriculum of this course for this year of entry and are in the process of confirming the modules.

If you don’t currently teach, you should be in a position where you have access to an education environment, for example through volunteering in a classroom setting or as a personal tutor.\nWhile the iPGCE does not offer Qualified Teacher Status, many international schools recognise the value of our postgraduate education certificate. Please see our explanation of Qualified Teacher Status for more information.\nNo. We ask that you have access to an educational context in which you can take over teaching activities. The first assignment requires you to plan, conduct and evaluate a teaching activity, as well as tie it to relevant pedagogical literature. All assignments and discussions revolve around you reflecting on your learning and your practice. This is possible in a variety of ways, however, and we have had full-time teachers, part-time teachers, self-employed tutors, teaching assistants and people volunteering in a school to gain experience, successfully complete the programme.\nNo. Although students who have the support from their institution definitely find the programme easier, it is not strictly necessary. Our students come from a variety of backgrounds, some have already taught for more than a decade and might even hold senior positions in their educational contexts. Others are just starting out. We are conscious that this means that you might have different needs. We have a school experience handbook, which suggests a number of lesson observations and teaching tasks, and these can be used to build a professional support-network within the school. This will help you to focus any discussions and to find support in areas you need to improve in. Online discussions will be available to those that use the handbook to share experiences and gain support from university, but the content of this handbook is not assessed – it is an additional support mechanism to help especially you to identify and address professional development.\nNo. The iPGCE is linked to pedagogy, teaching and learning in general, however, all assignments are phrased in a way that encourages you to specialise and contextualise your work.\nFor example, if you are interested in learner motivation, you might tailor your assignment to look into secondary school girls' motivation to engage in Physical Education lessons, or you might look into a primary school context that explores motivation in learner-centered learning.\nIf you are interested in assessment, you might focus on different attitudes towards formative assessment among learners in an international school context or question techniques in the Science classroom. These are just examples.\nOn the iPGCE, we ask you to contextualise your learning and work with your supervisor and peers to create assignments that are both academically viable and useful to your own development and career progression.\nThe answer to this question is complex, so please read the following information carefully. If you have any further queries, please get in touch.\nEssentially, teaching qualifications are national, professional qualifications and they are typically government-approved. Therefore Qualified Teaching Status (QTS) in England is, legally, only valid in England. While it may be a shorthand in other contexts, it does not, for example, qualify a teacher to teach in other countries without an appropriate conversion.\nSimilarly, teachers who trained in other countries may need to convert their qualification, should they want to teach in England. Even in England, however, QTS is currently needed to teach in state schools, but not, legally, in academies or private schools, which describes a large proportion of schools in England.\nQTS is a specifically England-relevant qualification, so it is very difficult to obtain abroad, apart from in a very small number of accredited schools. International schools are typically aware of this, but if you have concerns do discuss them with the relevant school or us.\nMost of our students are already involved in the international school sector, as teachers, teaching assistants or in other roles. Each cohort of students so far has included the following:\nWhile ‘Qualified Teaching Status’ or being a ‘qualified teacher’ might be a shorthand used in job descriptions or in general talk, it is often used with two very different meanings. On the one hand, it is a legal term, related to a very specific professionally accredited qualification for a very specific context.\nWe want you to trust that you are getting a highly valuable degree from a prestigious university, so we need to explain to you that, with this definition, the iPGCE is not for you – however, if you are looking to move to and teach in England in future, there is an assessment-only route to qualified teaching status, for which the iPGCE will stand you in very good stead as preparation.\nThe other meaning schools might use to refer to a qualified teacher is by using the term as shorthand for a teacher who has pedagogically sound training, is able to plan, teach and evaluate lessons, understand their local and professional context – and be able to add to it through practitioner-led research – and engage reflectively in their own practice.\nWith that, we can help – and we can prove it. Schools are sending us multiple students across different cohorts and schools are making offers to unqualified applicants, on the condition that they undertake our iPGCE.\nOverall, we find that schools are very much aware of difficulties of obtaining English QTS whilst working abroad and our students tell us that their schools are happy to accept the iPGCE as a postgraduate education certificate from a university with a very long-standing background in teacher training.\nSo, while we obviously cannot guarantee that all schools will accept the iPGCE, we hope this information is helpful to you in making your decision.\nThe certificate states the full title and that you are awarded the International Postgraduate Certificate in Education.\nA selection of modules is available each year - some examples are below. There may be changes before you start your course. From May of the year of entry, formal programme regulations will be available in our Programme Regulations Finder.\nEducation, Teaching and Learning\n\n\nThis module will provide you with a solid grounding in the general principles of pedagogy, from a range of different theoretical perspectives, and will explore key topics such as aspects of teaching, planning, assessment, policy, classroom management, special educational needs, learner motivation and learner autonomy. Through guided reading, structured discussions and the use of other online materials, you will explore educational practice and issues particularly related to both your context and your teaching subject, comparing and contrasting your own experiences with those of other course participants and the literature, leading to critical reflection on yourself as an educational practitioner, and, ultimately, to the development of new educational practice.\n30 credits\n\n\nPractice-based Inquiry\n\n\nThis module provides you with the opportunity to devise and carry out a small scale research study on a topic relevant to your own practice. Supported by guided readings and online discussions surrounding research methods, methodology, ethics and the evaluation and writing up of research data, you will be able to reflect on your practice through the process of original research, culminating in a research report. The module gives you the opportunity to explore opportunities for change in your own context, either at classroom or institutional level, or, in some cases, going beyond, enabling you to base innovation on reading, research, and reflection.\n30 credits\nThis module will provide you with a solid grounding in the general principles of pedagogy, from a range of different theoretical perspectives, and will explore key topics such as aspects of teaching, planning, assessment, policy, classroom management, special educational needs, learner motivation and learner autonomy.

Please see our explanation of Qualified Teacher Status for more information.FAQsDo I need to be working in a school and is there a minimum number of teaching hours?No. We ask that you have access to an educational context in which you can take over teaching activities. The first assignment requires you to plan, conduct and evaluate a teaching activity, as well as tie it to relevant pedagogical literature. All assignments and discussions revolve around you reflecting on your learning and your practice. This is possible in a variety of ways, however, and we have had full-time teachers, part-time teachers, self-employed tutors, teaching assistants and people volunteering in a school to gain experience, successfully complete the programme.Do I need to find a mentor in my educational institution?No. Although students who have the support from their institution definitely find the programme easier, it is not strictly necessary. Our students come from a variety of backgrounds, some have already taught for more than a decade and might even hold senior positions in their educational contexts. Others are just starting out. We are conscious that this means that you might have different needs. We have a school experience handbook, which suggests a number of lesson observations and teaching tasks, and these can be used to build a professional support-network within the school. This will help you to focus any discussions and to find support in areas you need to improve in. Online discussions will be available to those that use the handbook to share experiences and gain support from university, but the content of this handbook is not assessed – it is an additional support mechanism to help especially you to identify and address professional development.Does the iPGCE relate to a specific subject or sector?No. The iPGCE is linked to pedagogy, teaching and learning in general, however, all assignments are phrased in a way that encourages you to specialise and contextualise your work.For example, if you are interested in learner motivation, you might tailor your assignment to look into secondary school girls' motivation to engage in Physical Education lessons, or you might look into a primary school context that explores motivation in learner-centered learning.If you are interested in assessment, you might focus on different attitudes towards formative assessment among learners in an international school context or question techniques in the Science classroom. These are just examples.On the iPGCE, we ask you to contextualise your learning and work with your supervisor and peers to create assignments that are both academically viable and useful to your own development and career progression.Does the iPGCE offer Qualified Teacher Status?The answer to this question is complex, so please read the following information carefully. If you have any further queries, please get in touch.Essentially, teaching qualifications are national, professional qualifications and they are typically government-approved. Therefore Qualified Teaching Status (QTS) in England is, legally, only valid in England. While it may be a shorthand in other contexts, it does not, for example, qualify a teacher to teach in other countries without an appropriate conversion.Similarly, teachers who trained in other countries may need to convert their qualification, should they want to teach in England. Even in England, however, QTS is currently needed to teach in state schools, but not, legally, in academies or private schools, which describes a large proportion of schools in England.QTS is a specifically England-relevant qualification, so it is very difficult to obtain abroad, apart from in a very small number of accredited schools. International schools are typically aware of this, but if you have concerns do discuss them with the relevant school or us.Most of our students are already involved in the international school sector, as teachers, teaching assistants or in other roles. Each cohort of students so far has included the following:students who make the jump from teaching assistant to teacher in the international school sector, on the basis of the iPGCEstudents who have gained a teaching position on the condition that they complete the iPGCE in their first year of teachingstudents who have been teaching for several years, and are using the iPGCE as a stepping stone for higher-level (Masters) study to advance their careersstudents who use the iPGCE as proof of a post-graduate educational qualification from a highly regarded institution.While ‘Qualified Teaching Status’ or being a ‘qualified teacher’ might be a shorthand used in job descriptions or in general talk, it is often used with two very different meanings. On the one hand, it is a legal term, related to a very specific professionally accredited qualification for a very specific context.We want you to trust that you are getting a highly valuable degree from a prestigious university, so we need to explain to you that, with this definition, the iPGCE is not for you – however, if you are looking to move to and teach in England in future, there is an assessment-only route to qualified teaching status, for which the iPGCE will stand you in very good stead as preparation.The other meaning schools might use to refer to a qualified teacher is by using the term as shorthand for a teacher who has pedagogically sound training, is able to plan, teach and evaluate lessons, understand their local and professional context – and be able to add to it through practitioner-led research – and engage reflectively in their own practice.With that, we can help – and we can prove it. Schools are sending us multiple students across different cohorts and schools are making offers to unqualified applicants, on the condition that they undertake our iPGCE.Overall, we find that schools are very much aware of difficulties of obtaining English QTS whilst working abroad and our students tell us that their schools are happy to accept the iPGCE as a postgraduate education certificate from a university with a very long-standing background in teacher training.So, while we obviously cannot guarantee that all schools will accept the iPGCE, we hope this information is helpful to you in making your decision.What wording is shown on the certificate students receive upon completion of the course?The certificate states the full title and that you are awarded the International Postgraduate Certificate in Education.\n\n\nModules\n\n\n\nA selection of modules is available each year - some examples are below.

Through guided reading, structured discussions and the use of other online materials, you will explore educational practice and issues particularly related to both your context and your teaching subject, comparing and contrasting your own experiences with those of other course participants and the literature, leading to critical reflection on yourself as an educational practitioner, and, ultimately, to the development of new educational practice.\n30 credits\n\n\nPractice-based Inquiry\n\n\nThis module provides you with the opportunity to devise and carry out a small scale research study on a topic relevant to your own practice. Supported by guided readings and online discussions surrounding research methods, methodology, ethics and the evaluation and writing up of research data, you will be able to reflect on your practice through the process of original research, culminating in a research report. The module gives you the opportunity to explore opportunities for change in your own context, either at classroom or institutional level, or, in some cases, going beyond, enabling you to base innovation on reading, research, and reflection.\n30 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content of our courses is reviewed annually to make sure it's up-to-date and relevant.

If you don’t currently teach, you should be in a position where you have access to an education environment, for example through volunteering in a classroom setting or as a personal tutor.Qualified Teaching StatusWhile the iPGCE does not offer Qualified Teacher Status, many international schools recognise the value of our postgraduate education certificate. Please see our explanation of Qualified Teacher Status for more information.FAQsDo I need to be working in a school and is there a minimum number of teaching hours?No. We ask that you have access to an educational context in which you can take over teaching activities. The first assignment requires you to plan, conduct and evaluate a teaching activity, as well as tie it to relevant pedagogical literature. All assignments and discussions revolve around you reflecting on your learning and your practice. This is possible in a variety of ways, however, and we have had full-time teachers, part-time teachers, self-employed tutors, teaching assistants and people volunteering in a school to gain experience, successfully complete the programme.Do I need to find a mentor in my educational institution?No. Although students who have the support from their institution definitely find the programme easier, it is not strictly necessary. Our students come from a variety of backgrounds, some have already taught for more than a decade and might even hold senior positions in their educational contexts. Others are just starting out. We are conscious that this means that you might have different needs. We have a school experience handbook, which suggests a number of lesson observations and teaching tasks, and these can be used to build a professional support-network within the school. This will help you to focus any discussions and to find support in areas you need to improve in. Online discussions will be available to those that use the handbook to share experiences and gain support from university, but the content of this handbook is not assessed – it is an additional support mechanism to help especially you to identify and address professional development.Does the iPGCE relate to a specific subject or sector?No. The iPGCE is linked to pedagogy, teaching and learning in general, however, all assignments are phrased in a way that encourages you to specialise and contextualise your work.For example, if you are interested in learner motivation, you might tailor your assignment to look into secondary school girls' motivation to engage in Physical Education lessons, or you might look into a primary school context that explores motivation in learner-centered learning.If you are interested in assessment, you might focus on different attitudes towards formative assessment among learners in an international school context or question techniques in the Science classroom. These are just examples.On the iPGCE, we ask you to contextualise your learning and work with your supervisor and peers to create assignments that are both academically viable and useful to your own development and career progression.Does the iPGCE offer Qualified Teacher Status?The answer to this question is complex, so please read the following information carefully. If you have any further queries, please get in touch.Essentially, teaching qualifications are national, professional qualifications and they are typically government-approved.

Please see our explanation of Qualified Teacher Status for more information.FAQsDo I need to be working in a school and is there a minimum number of teaching hours?No. We ask that you have access to an educational context in which you can take over teaching activities. The first assignment requires you to plan, conduct and evaluate a teaching activity, as well as tie it to relevant pedagogical literature. All assignments and discussions revolve around you reflecting on your learning and your practice. This is possible in a variety of ways, however, and we have had full-time teachers, part-time teachers, self-employed tutors, teaching assistants and people volunteering in a school to gain experience, successfully complete the programme.Do I need to find a mentor in my educational institution?No. Although students who have the support from their institution definitely find the programme easier, it is not strictly necessary. Our students come from a variety of backgrounds, some have already taught for more than a decade and might even hold senior positions in their educational contexts. Others are just starting out. We are conscious that this means that you might have different needs. We have a school experience handbook, which suggests a number of lesson observations and teaching tasks, and these can be used to build a professional support-network within the school. This will help you to focus any discussions and to find support in areas you need to improve in. Online discussions will be available to those that use the handbook to share experiences and gain support from university, but the content of this handbook is not assessed – it is an additional support mechanism to help especially you to identify and address professional development.Does the iPGCE relate to a specific subject or sector?No. The iPGCE is linked to pedagogy, teaching and learning in general, however, all assignments are phrased in a way that encourages you to specialise and contextualise your work.For example, if you are interested in learner motivation, you might tailor your assignment to look into secondary school girls' motivation to engage in Physical Education lessons, or you might look into a primary school context that explores motivation in learner-centered learning.If you are interested in assessment, you might focus on different attitudes towards formative assessment among learners in an international school context or question techniques in the Science classroom. These are just examples.On the iPGCE, we ask you to contextualise your learning and work with your supervisor and peers to create assignments that are both academically viable and useful to your own development and career progression.Does the iPGCE offer Qualified Teacher Status?The answer to this question is complex, so please read the following information carefully. If you have any further queries, please get in touch.Essentially, teaching qualifications are national, professional qualifications and they are typically government-approved. Therefore Qualified Teaching Status (QTS) in England is, legally, only valid in England. While it may be a shorthand in other contexts, it does not, for example, qualify a teacher to teach in other countries without an appropriate conversion.Similarly, teachers who trained in other countries may need to convert their qualification, should they want to teach in England. Even in England, however, QTS is currently needed to teach in state schools, but not, legally, in academies or private schools, which describes a large proportion of schools in England.QTS is a specifically England-relevant qualification, so it is very difficult to obtain abroad, apart from in a very small number of accredited schools. International schools are typically aware of this, but if you have concerns do discuss them with the relevant school or us.Most of our students are already involved in the international school sector, as teachers, teaching assistants or in other roles. Each cohort of students so far has included the following:students who make the jump from teaching assistant to teacher in the international school sector, on the basis of the iPGCEstudents who have gained a teaching position on the condition that they complete the iPGCE in their first year of teachingstudents who have been teaching for several years, and are using the iPGCE as a stepping stone for higher-level (Masters) study to advance their careersstudents who use the iPGCE as proof of a post-graduate educational qualification from a highly regarded institution.While ‘Qualified Teaching Status’ or being a ‘qualified teacher’ might be a shorthand used in job descriptions or in general talk, it is often used with two very different meanings. On the one hand, it is a legal term, related to a very specific professionally accredited qualification for a very specific context.We want you to trust that you are getting a highly valuable degree from a prestigious university, so we need to explain to you that, with this definition, the iPGCE is not for you – however, if you are looking to move to and teach in England in future, there is an assessment-only route to qualified teaching status, for which the iPGCE will stand you in very good stead as preparation.The other meaning schools might use to refer to a qualified teacher is by using the term as shorthand for a teacher who has pedagogically sound training, is able to plan, teach and evaluate lessons, understand their local and professional context – and be able to add to it through practitioner-led research – and engage reflectively in their own practice.With that, we can help – and we can prove it. Schools are sending us multiple students across different cohorts and schools are making offers to unqualified applicants, on the condition that they undertake our iPGCE.Overall, we find that schools are very much aware of difficulties of obtaining English QTS whilst working abroad and our students tell us that their schools are happy to accept the iPGCE as a postgraduate education certificate from a university with a very long-standing background in teacher training.So, while we obviously cannot guarantee that all schools will accept the iPGCE, we hope this information is helpful to you in making your decision.What wording is shown on the certificate students receive upon completion of the course?The certificate states the full title and that you are awarded the International Postgraduate Certificate in Education.\nModules\n\n\n\nA selection of modules is available each year - some examples are below.

Through guided reading, structured discussions and the use of other online materials, you will explore educational practice and issues particularly related to both your context and your teaching subject, comparing and contrasting your own experiences with those of other course participants and the literature, leading to critical reflection on yourself as an educational practitioner, and, ultimately, to the development of new educational practice.\n30 credits\n\n\nPractice-based Inquiry\n\n\nThis module provides you with the opportunity to devise and carry out a small scale research study on a topic relevant to your own practice. Supported by guided readings and online discussions surrounding research methods, methodology, ethics and the evaluation and writing up of research data, you will be able to reflect on your practice through the process of original research, culminating in a research report. The module gives you the opportunity to explore opportunities for change in your own context, either at classroom or institutional level, or, in some cases, going beyond, enabling you to base innovation on reading, research, and reflection.\n30 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content of our courses is reviewed annually to make sure it's up-to-date and relevant.

While it may be a shorthand in other contexts, it does not, for example, qualify a teacher to teach in other countries without an appropriate conversion.Similarly, teachers who trained in other countries may need to convert their qualification, should they want to teach in England. Even in England, however, QTS is currently needed to teach in state schools, but not, legally, in academies or private schools, which describes a large proportion of schools in England.QTS is a specifically England-relevant qualification, so it is very difficult to obtain abroad, apart from in a very small number of accredited schools. International schools are typically aware of this, but if you have concerns do discuss them with the relevant school or us.Most of our students are already involved in the international school sector, as teachers, teaching assistants or in other roles. Each cohort of students so far has included the following:students who make the jump from teaching assistant to teacher in the international school sector, on the basis of the iPGCEstudents who have gained a teaching position on the condition that they complete the iPGCE in their first year of teachingstudents who have been teaching for several years, and are using the iPGCE as a stepping stone for higher-level (Masters) study to advance their careersstudents who use the iPGCE as proof of a post-graduate educational qualification from a highly regarded institution.While ‘Qualified Teaching Status’ or being a ‘qualified teacher’ might be a shorthand used in job descriptions or in general talk, it is often used with two very different meanings. On the one hand, it is a legal term, related to a very specific professionally accredited qualification for a very specific context.We want you to trust that you are getting a highly valuable degree from a prestigious university, so we need to explain to you that, with this definition, the iPGCE is not for you – however, if you are looking to move to and teach in England in future, there is an assessment-only route to qualified teaching status, for which the iPGCE will stand you in very good stead as preparation.The other meaning schools might use to refer to a qualified teacher is by using the term as shorthand for a teacher who has pedagogically sound training, is able to plan, teach and evaluate lessons, understand their local and professional context – and be able to add to it through practitioner-led research – and engage reflectively in their own practice.With that, we can help – and we can prove it. Schools are sending us multiple students across different cohorts and schools are making offers to unqualified applicants, on the condition that they undertake our iPGCE.Overall, we find that schools are very much aware of difficulties of obtaining English QTS whilst working abroad and our students tell us that their schools are happy to accept the iPGCE as a postgraduate education certificate from a university with a very long-standing background in teacher training.So, while we obviously cannot guarantee that all schools will accept the iPGCE, we hope this information is helpful to you in making your decision.What wording is shown on the certificate students receive upon completion of the course?The certificate states the full title and that you are awarded the International Postgraduate Certificate in Education.\nModules\n\n\n\nA selection of modules is available each year - some examples are below.

Through guided reading, structured discussions and the use of other online materials, you will explore educational practice and issues particularly related to both your context and your teaching subject, comparing and contrasting your own experiences with those of other course participants and the literature, leading to critical reflection on yourself as an educational practitioner, and, ultimately, to the development of new educational practice.\n30 credits\n\n\nPractice-based Inquiry\n\n\nThis module provides you with the opportunity to devise and carry out a small scale research study on a topic relevant to your own practice. Supported by guided readings and online discussions surrounding research methods, methodology, ethics and the evaluation and writing up of research data, you will be able to reflect on your practice through the process of original research, culminating in a research report.

If you don’t currently teach, you should be in a position where you have access to an education environment, for example through volunteering in a classroom setting or as a personal tutor.Qualified Teaching StatusWhile the iPGCE does not offer Qualified Teacher Status, many international schools recognise the value of our postgraduate education certificate. Please see our explanation of Qualified Teacher Status for more information.FAQsDo I need to be working in a school and is there a minimum number of teaching hours?No. We ask that you have access to an educational context in which you can take over teaching activities. The first assignment requires you to plan, conduct and evaluate a teaching activity, as well as tie it to relevant pedagogical literature. All assignments and discussions revolve around you reflecting on your learning and your practice. This is possible in a variety of ways, however, and we have had full-time teachers, part-time teachers, self-employed tutors, teaching assistants and people volunteering in a school to gain experience, successfully complete the programme.Do I need to find a mentor in my educational institution?No. Although students who have the support from their institution definitely find the programme easier, it is not strictly necessary. Our students come from a variety of backgrounds, some have already taught for more than a decade and might even hold senior positions in their educational contexts. Others are just starting out. We are conscious that this means that you might have different needs. We have a school experience handbook, which suggests a number of lesson observations and teaching tasks, and these can be used to build a professional support-network within the school. This will help you to focus any discussions and to find support in areas you need to improve in. Online discussions will be available to those that use the handbook to share experiences and gain support from university, but the content of this handbook is not assessed – it is an additional support mechanism to help especially you to identify and address professional development.Does the iPGCE relate to a specific subject or sector?No. The iPGCE is linked to pedagogy, teaching and learning in general, however, all assignments are phrased in a way that encourages you to specialise and contextualise your work.For example, if you are interested in learner motivation, you might tailor your assignment to look into secondary school girls' motivation to engage in Physical Education lessons, or you might look into a primary school context that explores motivation in learner-centered learning.If you are interested in assessment, you might focus on different attitudes towards formative assessment among learners in an international school context or question techniques in the Science classroom. These are just examples.On the iPGCE, we ask you to contextualise your learning and work with your supervisor and peers to create assignments that are both academically viable and useful to your own development and career progression.Does the iPGCE offer Qualified Teacher Status?The answer to this question is complex, so please read the following information carefully.

Working across the School of Geography and Planning and the School of Medicine and Population Health, you'll develop an understanding of the interventions necessary to improve the health of communities.\nThe course is rooted in principles of interdisciplinary learning, decolonising knowledge, connecting theory with policy and practice. You'll also have the flexibility to tailor the course to you own interests.\nThrough this approach it offers a unique combination of academic excellence, tailored professional skills teaching, an optional field class, and a research-based dissertation based on placements, research collaborations or independent research.\nCore modules will teach you about changing ideas of ‘development’ since the mid-twentieth century and how these have translated into very different policy approaches and outcomes. You'll learn about poverty and how it has changed, about how development ideas and processes connect to questions of gender, culture and race, about how processes such as migration, urbanisation and technological evolution intersect with development, and about the global governance of international development.\nYou'll have the opportunity to build a range of professional skills, and will be trained in core research methods in order to undertake an individual piece of original research. Our placement-based dissertation option also enables you to gain valuable work experience.\nOptional modules from across the University are also available. These include subjects as diverse as food security, public health, urban development, and climate change.\nAn optional international field class encourages you to engage with overseas development and community organisations through an intensive week of activities. We also offer a lower cost and more sustainable UK-based ‘hybrid’ field class as an alternative. International field class locations are subject to variation and subject to the number of students participating, but previous destinations have included Peru, Nepal and South Africa.\nThe costs of optional field classes modules and placements are not included in your tuition fees. A limited amount of funding, accessed through a competitive process, is available to students to help finance field classes.\nAn optional international field class encourages you to engage with overseas development and community organisations through an intensive week of activities.\nWe also offer a lower cost and more sustainable UK-based ‘hybrid’ field class as an alternative.\nInternational field class locations are subject to variation and subject to the number of students participating, but previous destinations have included Peru, Nepal and South Africa.\nThe costs of optional field classes modules and placements are not included in your tuition fees.

Students pursued research projects around themes of gender, health, migration, earthquake disaster recovery, community forestry and climate change. This research had a direct impact through a final dissemination event which in recent years involved national political and media attention as well as regional and local stakeholders.\nThe field class is an amazing part of the masters programme, which allows you to consolidate the theory and ideas learnt in lectures, in the field. As well as preparing you for the dissertation it is also a great chance to meet and learn from students of different cultures in a new and interesting environment.Helena\nThe Tanzania field class gave students practical experience of field research. Working with our NGO partner KEDA, students were based in rural communities around Mt Kilimanjaro.\nThey researched a range of issues that affect local communities such as health, environmental change and poverty alleviation among smallholder farmers. Each year students fed back to district officials and previously had even been interviewed for National TV.\nThe field class in Tanzania provided the incredible opportunity to bring case studies we had always read about in books and lectures to life through hands-on fieldwork. I was able to learn about issues in water, health and sanitation through the voices of local people. Conducting research in the rich and vibrant culture of Tanzania was an unforgettable experience.Shahreen\nThe Ecuador field class gave students the opportunity to work closely with our local partner Intercultural Outreach Initiative, which is based on the Island Isabela in the Galapagos Islands. Our students gained experience in field research by exploring a range of issues that affect the local communities such as food security, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) issues and ocean plastic pollution. Each year students feed back to district officials and local stakeholders.\nYou can read a blog from one of our students about a virtual field class.\nThe virtual field class provided an opportunity to experience the challenges of international fieldwork, and allowed us to develop skills in adapting research to changing circumstances and using video interviews for data collection, which will be useful skills for the future! It was a great way to gain an understanding and insight into the situation around plastics in the Galapagos, despite not being able to visit!Elle\nThe dissertation with placement gives you valuable practical experience of working in a development organisation and engaging with development issues.\nYou'll spend six to eight weeks in June or July based in a host organisation, where you'll carry out a research project identified by the organisation and approved by the University. Your project will have clear practical relevance and will generate findings that form the basis of your dissertation. Students may also spend time working directly on the organisation's core activities.\nWe currently work with over 30 host organisations in the UK and across the globe. Some have a wide remit, others have a specialist focus on issues such as conservation, education or health.\nPlacements to overseas destinations are subject to the same potential constraints imposed by travel conditions and health risks due to Covid-19.\nThe costs of the dissertation with placement module are not included in your tuition fees. A limited number of low-cost local placements are also available.\nWe accept medical students who wish to intercalate their studies. Find out more on the Medical School's website.\nA selection of modules is available each year - some examples are below. There may be changes before you start your course. From May of the year of entry, formal programme regulations will be available in our Programme Regulations Finder.\nCore modules:\n\n\nIntroduction to Research Methods\n\n\nThis module is offered across several programmes. Learning activities for the module are tailored to your individual specialist areas to provide learning that is relevant and specific to your chosen degree programme.\n\n\n\nThis module provides students with an introduction to quantitative and qualitative research methods; it covers all stages of the research process from planning and design and research ethics and public and patient involvement, through to data collection and analysis and dissemination stages. It is specifically designed for students who do not have prior research experience and would be suitable for students from a range of backgrounds, but is particularly relevant to those interested in applied health related research. The course also provides a foundation for further learning in specific research methods.\n15 credits\n\n\nCritical Reflections in Global Health\n\n\nGlobal health has been described as the art and science of preventing disease, prolonging life, and promoting health through the organised efforts of society, with the goal being the attainment of biological, physical, and mental well-being of all members of society. In this module we take an inter-disciplinary approach to explore these themes.\n\nAligned with the themes of our key reader (7th edition of the Oxford Textbook of Global Public Health) we will consider some of the key concepts of global health, explore some of the determinants of health, and consider some of the key function / methods applied to address global health issues. We will then reflect on these themes in relation to the practice of global health through the lens of specific health challenges. Throughout the module themes such as inequalities in health, complexities in our response, and the political, social, and economic context within which we work will be repeatedly raised and discussed. \n\nIn delivering this module we are excited to have secured the expertise of regional, national, and international leaders and experts who will share their learnings on a diverse range of subjects that include socioeconomic and health inequalities, health intelligence, and sexual and reproductive health. In relation to the sharing of experiences and expertise, and in stimulating engaged discussion, throughout the module you will be encouraged to develop and use a reflective learning approach to consider shifts in your perception and understanding of the issues raised.\n15 credits\n\n\nIdeas and Practice in International Development\n\n\nThis module introduces students to key theoretical debates in international development. Co-taught by the Departments of Geography, Politics, Urban Studies and Planning, and Sociological Studies, it takes an interdisciplinary approach to exploring how thinking about development has changed over time, and why it has changed. The module also encourages students to think about the relationship between development theory and development practice.  It is spread over two semesters, in order to maximise the synergies between the core content of this module and the various other core and optional modules that students will take across the year.  The first semester focuses on the overarching questions of how development has been understood and conceptualised from the colonial period to the present. The changing development paradigms presented through weekly lectures are explored in depth through fortnightly seminars, each of which focuses on a set of key questions about changing theoretical perspectives and their implications for policy. The second semester then shifts focus onto a set of critical issues for policy and practice, including (for example) global health, migration, technology, urbanization and development finance.  The overall aim of the module is to build students' understanding of the origins of the idea of international development, changing debates about its meaning and purpose, and the implications of these for policy and practice.\n30 credits\nCore modules:\nThis module is offered across several programmes.

Political and non-political agents at multiple scales have recognised that Global Hunger and Food Security (of which Food Justice is a primary component) is a key challenge requiring urgent interdisciplinary investigation and problem solving. There remains limited agreement as to how best to approach these issues. This module provides students with a background to the problems encompassed within the food security/food justice nexus by drawing on academic and policy debates that focus on both the macro as well as the micro impacts. By looking across food systems, the module also critically evaluates different strategies for mitigating the impacts of food insecurity and injustice.  In addition to academic, knowledge and critical thinking skills, the module will help students to develop the following attributes: Communication, Networking, Collaboration, Influencing, Inclusivity, Defining Purpose, and Growth Mindset.\n15 credits\n\n\nProfessional Skills for Development\n\n\nIn this module, which is taught across several departments drawing in a range of multi-disciplinary expertise, students gain a critically engaged understanding of professional practice in international development and develop a range of professional skills for future career paths.  Through the module students will learn to apply academic training to real-world situations, with a strong focus on employability-related skills.\n\n\n\nStudents will be taught about a set of key transferable and employability skills in keeping with the Sheffield Graduate Attributes before being given the option to choose between one of three specialist skill development tracks for hands-on group work.   The key transferable skills covered will include communications, project design and fundraising, policy analysis and consultancy work, ethics and cultural sensitivity.  Whichever of the specialist tracks they choose, students will work on a group-based project output and an individual written assessment.  While acquiring some specialist skills, all students will reflect on all key transferable skills offered in the first half of the module.\n15 credits\n\n\nThe Science of Environmental Change\n\n\nThis module gives students a critical understanding of the science behind historical and recent environmental change. The module covers the core debates in environmental change, the science behind these changes, methods for detecting environmental change, and the impacts of these changes, and projected future changes.\n15 credits\n\n\nEpidemiology\n\n\nEpidemiology is the discipline underpinning both effective public health practice and research into the causes, control and prevention of disease.  Knowledge and understanding of epidemiological concepts and methods is a basic requirement for effective public health practice. \n\nThis module will provide an introduction to epidemiology covering key epidemiological concepts; measures of disease; association and causation; confounding and bias.  It will also introduce research designs including cross-sectional, ecological, cohort, case-control and intervention studies and introduce population health measures such as screening.\n15 credits\n\n\nDisaster and Emergency Management\n\n\nDisasters and emergencies can strike any community.  It is not a question of whether a disaster will occur but when.  However, the likelihood, scale and impact of a disaster can be minimized through appropriate emergency planning, preparation and response by the community, governmental and non-governmental organisations.  This module will cover the key concepts of disaster and emergency management, explore some of the contemporary issues and develop students' knowledge and skills in this field.\n15 credits\n\n\nFoundations of GIS\n\n\nThis module introduces students to the core principles and skills of GIS. It covers the major sources of data used to study the lived environment and the variety of ways it can be displayed to aid both understanding and analysis. The module has a particular focus on techniques used in the analysis of socio-economic and demographic data and its potential applications. It is taught through a combination of lectures and practical workshops using ArcGIS software.\n15 credits\n\n\nThe Digital Self\n\n\nThis module explores how gender, age, race, class and other identities are being reimagined in what various commentators have called a 'social media age'. It provides students with an in-depth understanding of social media platforms, roles in people's identity negotiations, examining users' social media identities in different global contexts, and paying close attention to the intersections between different identities. It reviews debates about self and  identity formations from the earliest digital media moments and considers contemporary concerns, such as: anonymity and agency; selfies and influencers; online censorship, resistance and collective identities; social media fandoms; disconnection and digital detox\n15 credits\nOptional modules:\nFood Security and Food Justice are areas of increasing importance at local, national, transnational and global scales.

Central to the module is a focus on developing critical reflectivity on the nature of development in a particular globalised and historicised context. You will have the opportunity to practise and build on research skills learnt in Semester 1 as well as dealing with issues of ethics, power and co-produced development research and practice. You will work in-person with UK partners or conduct remote or hybrid research with overseas partners, you will develop transferable skills through teamwork and engagement with a variety of stakeholders.\n\nFor field trips to run we require a minimum number of students to sign up for these modules. This varies depending on the specifics of individual field trips. If this number is not reached, the field trip will be cancelled. To assist with planning, this module must be selected by the end of the Semester One Add/Drop period.\n15 credits\n\n\nEnvironment, Society and Development: Key Issues, Debates and Concepts\n\n\nThis module engages critically with the key theoretical debates that shape the relationships between the environment, society and international development. By looking at current questions in development theory and their relationship to development practice in the context of the Anthropocene and environmental change, it encourages students to think critically about the ways in which interdisciplinary approaches define issues and problems, and the theoretical viewpoints that inform their actions. The module is taught primarily through seminars: these structure students' learning, and provide an environment in which they can develop their skills in researching, presenting and debating arguments drawn from the academic literature on international development.\n15 credits\n\n\nInternational Development Fieldclass\n\n\nThis optional field class module provides you with the opportunity to explore and engage with development issues through practical fieldwork experiences, and to enhance your understanding of grass-roots development organisations. \n\nCentral to the module is a focus on developing critical reflectivity on the nature of development in a particular globalised and historicised context. You will have the opportunity to practise and build on research skills learnt in Semester 1 as well as dealing with issues of ethics, power and co-produced development research and practice. \n\nYou will work with an International partner, and you will develop transferable skills through teamwork and engagement with a variety of stakeholders.\n\nFor field trips to run we require a minimum number of students to sign up for these modules.

This understanding is then applied to consider the challenge of living with climate change in the Global South. The module is taught through seminars and lectures. Lectures introduce and impart factual knowledge while seminars allow discussion and an emphasis on applying key concepts to practical situations. Together these structure students' learning, and provide an environment in which they can develop their skills in researching, presenting and debating arguments drawn from the wide ranging literature on climate change.\n15 credits\n\n\nHealth Promotion\n\n\nHealth Promotion enables people to take control over and improve their own health.  It builds on knowledge from behavioural science that individual behaviour and health are determined by the social, physical and economic environment.  This module will consider the nature of health promotion from a global perspective, the associated ideological dilemmas, current understanding of individual and group behaviours, methods of promoting health and the evaluation of health promotion.  The module will use the 5 key principles within the Ottawa Charter applied to health promotion as a framework.  Case studies will be used to give students practical examples of health promotion in different countries.\n15 credits\n\n\nPublic Health Informatics\n\n\nPublic Health Informatics is a module designed to look at how informatics and information technology can be used to help address some of the major issues in public health. Public health informatics was traditionally defined as the systematic application of information and computer science and technology to public health practice, research, and learning (Yasnoff, 2000). In this module, we examine this rapidly changing field, using a combination of lectures, individual and group exercises and self directed learning. Key issues around the local, national and international contributions that technology can make to public health are critically examined and students are given a theoretical and practical grounding in this increasingly important discipline.\n15 credits\n\n\nCommunicable Disease Control\n\n\nHealth protection is one of the cornerstones of public health.  The control of communicable diseases is one of the major functions of health protection.  This module will cover the principles of surveillance, outbreak management, immunisation programmes, and prevention and control of infectious diseases.  It will also present a broad range of common infectious disease topics including HIV, tuberculosis, meningitis, diarrhoeal illnesses and hospital acquired infections.  This module would provide the essential foundations for students intending to undertake the Faculty of Public Health Part A/Diploma examination.\n15 credits\n\n\nUsing Policy to Strengthen Health Systems\n\n\nThe module seeks to build on students' own experiences and knowledge of policy and public health systems. During the module, you will work individually and also in groups to develop a critical understanding of policy within particular public health systems. You will consider how policy to strengthen public health systems is developed and how improvements might be targeted at any combination of the regional, national, district, and community levels.\n\nIn the module, policy is interpreted broadly as 'purposeful and deliberate actions' through which efforts can be made to reshape or address issues within public health systems and is about power and politics (cf. Gilson, 2012). Public health systems are understood both as public health systems (covering, for example, health protection, health promotion and health care public health) and, more narrowly, as health care systems. The module is suitable for students with a broad public health and health care knowledge, but also for those with more limited experience.\n15 credits\n\n\nCapitalism and Crisis\n\n\nDuring this module, you will explore the relationship between capitalism and crisis through the prism of the causes of, and fallout from, the 2008 crash.\n\nYou will unpack the core concepts of the module - capitalism and crisis - and gain a brief historical overview of pre-2008 economic crises to contextualise and compare the main content of the module. You shall then go on to survey competing explanations of the 2008 crisis, by starting narrow (i.e. regulation of banking) and then broadening out (i.e. evolution of capitalism).\n\nBy the end of the module, you will have examined the economic and political fallout of  the 2008 crisis, be able to debate the extent to which the crisis was truly global, and discuss the variety of political responses to the crash.\n30 credits\n\n\nCitizen Participation in Planning and Development\n\n\nRecent decades have seen a proliferation of initiatives to involve citizens in policy-making, planning and urban governance. There is widespread agreement that 'citizen engagement' can play a positive role in democratizing urban development. However, public participation raises a range of significant challenges for urban professional practice. This module will draw on critical debates about the roles citizens and publics can and should play in shaping the city to reflect on the theory and practice of participation. The module is taught through seminars which structure learning, and help students to research case studies of participatory initiatives.\n15 credits\n\n\nUrban Informality\n\n\nThe overall aim of this module is to critically examine informality, with a particular but not exclusive focus on cities of the Global South. The module relies on a mixture of lectures, seminars and student-led group work, with the latter focusing on an in-depth case study of a selected city. It explores patterns and causes of informality and discusses the strengths and limitations of a range of theoretical approaches. It also analyses the success of different real-world urban planning responses (understood in broad terms), including government-led, donor-led and community-focused ones, in addressing key urban issues in the context of informality.\n15 credits\nOptional modules:\nThis optional, UK-based field class provides you with the opportunity to explore and engage with development issues through practical fieldwork experiences.

The module is suitable for students with a broad public health and health care knowledge, but also for those with more limited experience.\nDuring this module, you will explore the relationship between capitalism and crisis through the prism of the causes of, and fallout from, the 2008 crash.\n\nYou will unpack the core concepts of the module - capitalism and crisis - and gain a brief historical overview of pre-2008 economic crises to contextualise and compare the main content of the module. You shall then go on to survey competing explanations of the 2008 crisis, by starting narrow (i.e. regulation of banking) and then broadening out (i.e. evolution of capitalism).\n\nBy the end of the module, you will have examined the economic and political fallout of  the 2008 crisis, be able to debate the extent to which the crisis was truly global, and discuss the variety of political responses to the crash.\nRecent decades have seen a proliferation of initiatives to involve citizens in policy-making, planning and urban governance. There is widespread agreement that 'citizen engagement' can play a positive role in democratizing urban development. However, public participation raises a range of significant challenges for urban professional practice. This module will draw on critical debates about the roles citizens and publics can and should play in shaping the city to reflect on the theory and practice of participation. The module is taught through seminars which structure learning, and help students to research case studies of participatory initiatives.\nThe overall aim of this module is to critically examine informality, with a particular but not exclusive focus on cities of the Global South. The module relies on a mixture of lectures, seminars and student-led group work, with the latter focusing on an in-depth case study of a selected city. It explores patterns and causes of informality and discusses the strengths and limitations of a range of theoretical approaches. It also analyses the success of different real-world urban planning responses (understood in broad terms), including government-led, donor-led and community-focused ones, in addressing key urban issues in the context of informality.\nCore modules - choose from:\n\n\nResearch Foundations with Placement\n\n\nThis module allows students to develop and manage an individual, interdisciplinary research project.  The module aims to help students to develop and apply research skills and an appreciation of the issues involved in managing a research project; to develop an understanding of the role of research in relation to theoretical and practical dimensions of the chosen discipline; and to further and deepen knowledge in their chosen area of international development. The module combines an independent research project with experience of working (in-person or virtually) with a development related organisation.  Students make a detailed analysis of an issue, topic or problem agreed with their host organisation, develop a research proposal, carry out research while on placement, and produce both a dissertation and a shorter consultancy-style report based on their dissertation findings. The module is supported by lectures, seminars, fieldwork and one-to-one supervision.  It includes core research methods required to undertake a dissertation at Masters level in the field of International Development, which are assessed through a 2,500-word research proposal in the Spring, and a final 10,000-word dissertation alongside the 2,500-word placement report at the end of Summer.\n60 credits\n\n\nResearch Foundations without Placement\n\n\nThis module allows students to develop and manage an individual, interdisciplinary research project.  The module aims to help students to develop and apply research skills and an appreciation of the issues involved in managing a research project; to develop an understanding of the role of research in relation to theoretical and practical dimensions of the chosen discipline; and to further and deepen knowledge in their chosen area of international development.

Working across the School of Geography and Planning and the School of Medicine and Population Health, you'll develop an understanding of the interventions necessary to improve the health of communities.The course is rooted in principles of interdisciplinary learning, decolonising knowledge, connecting theory with policy and practice. You'll also have the flexibility to tailor the course to you own interests.Through this approach it offers a unique combination of academic excellence, tailored professional skills teaching, an optional field class, and a research-based dissertation based on placements, research collaborations or independent research.Core modules will teach you about changing ideas of ‘development’ since the mid-twentieth century and how these have translated into very different policy approaches and outcomes. You'll learn about poverty and how it has changed, about how development ideas and processes connect to questions of gender, culture and race, about how processes such as migration, urbanisation and technological evolution intersect with development, and about the global governance of international development.You'll have the opportunity to build a range of professional skills, and will be trained in core research methods in order to undertake an individual piece of original research. Our placement-based dissertation option also enables you to gain valuable work experience.Optional modules from across the University are also available. These include subjects as diverse as food security, public health, urban development, and climate change.An optional international field class encourages you to engage with overseas development and community organisations through an intensive week of activities. We also offer a lower cost and more sustainable UK-based ‘hybrid’ field class as an alternative. International field class locations are subject to variation and subject to the number of students participating, but previous destinations have included Peru, Nepal and South Africa.The costs of optional field classes modules and placements are not included in your tuition fees. A limited amount of funding, accessed through a competitive process, is available to students to help finance field classes.Field class\n\n\nAn optional international field class encourages you to engage with overseas development and community organisations through an intensive week of activities.\nWe also offer a lower cost and more sustainable UK-based ‘hybrid’ field class as an alternative.\nInternational field class locations are subject to variation and subject to the number of students participating, but previous destinations have included Peru, Nepal and South Africa.\nThe costs of optional field classes modules and placements are not included in your tuition fees.

Students pursued research projects around themes of gender, health, migration, earthquake disaster recovery, community forestry and climate change. This research had a direct impact through a final dissemination event which in recent years involved national political and media attention as well as regional and local stakeholders.The field class is an amazing part of the masters programme, which allows you to consolidate the theory and ideas learnt in lectures, in the field. As well as preparing you for the dissertation it is also a great chance to meet and learn from students of different cultures in a new and interesting environment.HelenaTanzaniaThe Tanzania field class gave students practical experience of field research. Working with our NGO partner KEDA, students were based in rural communities around Mt Kilimanjaro.They researched a range of issues that affect local communities such as health, environmental change and poverty alleviation among smallholder farmers. Each year students fed back to district officials and previously had even been interviewed for National TV.The field class in Tanzania provided the incredible opportunity to bring case studies we had always read about in books and lectures to life through hands-on fieldwork. I was able to learn about issues in water, health and sanitation through the voices of local people. Conducting research in the rich and vibrant culture of Tanzania was an unforgettable experience.ShahreenEcuadorThe Ecuador field class gave students the opportunity to work closely with our local partner Intercultural Outreach Initiative, which is based on the Island Isabela in the Galapagos Islands. Our students gained experience in field research by exploring a range of issues that affect the local communities such as food security, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) issues and ocean plastic pollution. Each year students feed back to district officials and local stakeholders.You can read a blog from one of our students about a virtual field class.The virtual field class provided an opportunity to experience the challenges of international fieldwork, and allowed us to develop skills in adapting research to changing circumstances and using video interviews for data collection, which will be useful skills for the future! It was a great way to gain an understanding and insight into the situation around plastics in the Galapagos, despite not being able to visit!EllePlacement\n\n\nThe dissertation with placement gives you valuable practical experience of working in a development organisation and engaging with development issues.\nYou'll spend six to eight weeks in June or July based in a host organisation, where you'll carry out a research project identified by the organisation and approved by the University.

From May of the year of entry, formal programme regulations will be available in our Programme Regulations Finder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Autumn semester\n    \n\n      Spring semester\n    \n\n      Summer\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Core modules:\n\n\nIntroduction to Research Methods\n\n\nThis module is offered across several programmes. Learning activities for the module are tailored to your individual specialist areas to provide learning that is relevant and specific to your chosen degree programme.\n\n\n\nThis module provides students with an introduction to quantitative and qualitative research methods; it covers all stages of the research process from planning and design and research ethics and public and patient involvement, through to data collection and analysis and dissemination stages. It is specifically designed for students who do not have prior research experience and would be suitable for students from a range of backgrounds, but is particularly relevant to those interested in applied health related research. The course also provides a foundation for further learning in specific research methods.\n15 credits\n\n\nCritical Reflections in Global Health\n\n\nGlobal health has been described as the art and science of preventing disease, prolonging life, and promoting health through the organised efforts of society, with the goal being the attainment of biological, physical, and mental well-being of all members of society. In this module we take an inter-disciplinary approach to explore these themes.\n\nAligned with the themes of our key reader (7th edition of the Oxford Textbook of Global Public Health) we will consider some of the key concepts of global health, explore some of the determinants of health, and consider some of the key function / methods applied to address global health issues. We will then reflect on these themes in relation to the practice of global health through the lens of specific health challenges. Throughout the module themes such as inequalities in health, complexities in our response, and the political, social, and economic context within which we work will be repeatedly raised and discussed. \n\nIn delivering this module we are excited to have secured the expertise of regional, national, and international leaders and experts who will share their learnings on a diverse range of subjects that include socioeconomic and health inequalities, health intelligence, and sexual and reproductive health. In relation to the sharing of experiences and expertise, and in stimulating engaged discussion, throughout the module you will be encouraged to develop and use a reflective learning approach to consider shifts in your perception and understanding of the issues raised.\n15 credits\n\n\nIdeas and Practice in International Development\n\n\nThis module introduces students to key theoretical debates in international development. Co-taught by the Departments of Geography, Politics, Urban Studies and Planning, and Sociological Studies, it takes an interdisciplinary approach to exploring how thinking about development has changed over time, and why it has changed. The module also encourages students to think about the relationship between development theory and development practice.  It is spread over two semesters, in order to maximise the synergies between the core content of this module and the various other core and optional modules that students will take across the year.  The first semester focuses on the overarching questions of how development has been understood and conceptualised from the colonial period to the present. The changing development paradigms presented through weekly lectures are explored in depth through fortnightly seminars, each of which focuses on a set of key questions about changing theoretical perspectives and their implications for policy. The second semester then shifts focus onto a set of critical issues for policy and practice, including (for example) global health, migration, technology, urbanization and development finance.  The overall aim of the module is to build students' understanding of the origins of the idea of international development, changing debates about its meaning and purpose, and the implications of these for policy and practice.\n30 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Optional modules:\n\n\nTheory and Debates in Food Security and Food Justice\n\n\nFood Security and Food Justice are areas of increasing importance at local, national, transnational and global scales. Political and non-political agents at multiple scales have recognised that Global Hunger and Food Security (of which Food Justice is a primary component) is a key challenge requiring urgent interdisciplinary investigation and problem solving. There remains limited agreement as to how best to approach these issues. This module provides students with a background to the problems encompassed within the food security/food justice nexus by drawing on academic and policy debates that focus on both the macro as well as the micro impacts. By looking across food systems, the module also critically evaluates different strategies for mitigating the impacts of food insecurity and injustice.  In addition to academic, knowledge and critical thinking skills, the module will help students to develop the following attributes: Communication, Networking, Collaboration, Influencing, Inclusivity, Defining Purpose, and Growth Mindset.\n15 credits\n\n\nProfessional Skills for Development\n\n\nIn this module, which is taught across several departments drawing in a range of multi-disciplinary expertise, students gain a critically engaged understanding of professional practice in international development and develop a range of professional skills for future career paths.  Through the module students will learn to apply academic training to real-world situations, with a strong focus on employability-related skills.\n\n\n\nStudents will be taught about a set of key transferable and employability skills in keeping with the Sheffield Graduate Attributes before being given the option to choose between one of three specialist skill development tracks for hands-on group work.   The key transferable skills covered will include communications, project design and fundraising, policy analysis and consultancy work, ethics and cultural sensitivity.  Whichever of the specialist tracks they choose, students will work on a group-based project output and an individual written assessment.  While acquiring some specialist skills, all students will reflect on all key transferable skills offered in the first half of the module.\n15 credits\n\n\nThe Science of Environmental Change\n\n\nThis module gives students a critical understanding of the science behind historical and recent environmental change. The module covers the core debates in environmental change, the science behind these changes, methods for detecting environmental change, and the impacts of these changes, and projected future changes.\n15 credits\n\n\nEpidemiology\n\n\nEpidemiology is the discipline underpinning both effective public health practice and research into the causes, control and prevention of disease.  Knowledge and understanding of epidemiological concepts and methods is a basic requirement for effective public health practice. \n\nThis module will provide an introduction to epidemiology covering key epidemiological concepts; measures of disease; association and causation; confounding and bias.  It will also introduce research designs including cross-sectional, ecological, cohort, case-control and intervention studies and introduce population health measures such as screening.\n15 credits\n\n\nDisaster and Emergency Management\n\n\nDisasters and emergencies can strike any community.  It is not a question of whether a disaster will occur but when.  However, the likelihood, scale and impact of a disaster can be minimized through appropriate emergency planning, preparation and response by the community, governmental and non-governmental organisations.  This module will cover the key concepts of disaster and emergency management, explore some of the contemporary issues and develop students' knowledge and skills in this field.\n15 credits\n\n\nFoundations of GIS\n\n\nThis module introduces students to the core principles and skills of GIS. It covers the major sources of data used to study the lived environment and the variety of ways it can be displayed to aid both understanding and analysis. The module has a particular focus on techniques used in the analysis of socio-economic and demographic data and its potential applications. It is taught through a combination of lectures and practical workshops using ArcGIS software.\n15 credits\n\n\nThe Digital Self\n\n\nThis module explores how gender, age, race, class and other identities are being reimagined in what various commentators have called a 'social media age'. It provides students with an in-depth understanding of social media platforms, roles in people's identity negotiations, examining users' social media identities in different global contexts, and paying close attention to the intersections between different identities. It reviews debates about self and  identity formations from the earliest digital media moments and considers contemporary concerns, such as: anonymity and agency; selfies and influencers; online censorship, resistance and collective identities; social media fandoms; disconnection and digital detox\n15 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Optional modules:\n\n\nUK-Based Field Class\n\n\nThis optional, UK-based field class provides you with the opportunity to explore and engage with development issues through practical fieldwork experiences. Central to the module is a focus on developing critical reflectivity on the nature of development in a particular globalised and historicised context. You will have the opportunity to practise and build on research skills learnt in Semester 1 as well as dealing with issues of ethics, power and co-produced development research and practice. You will work in-person with UK partners or conduct remote or hybrid research with overseas partners, you will develop transferable skills through teamwork and engagement with a variety of stakeholders.\n\nFor field trips to run we require a minimum number of students to sign up for these modules. This varies depending on the specifics of individual field trips. If this number is not reached, the field trip will be cancelled. To assist with planning, this module must be selected by the end of the Semester One Add/Drop period.\n15 credits\n\n\nEnvironment, Society and Development: Key Issues, Debates and Concepts\n\n\nThis module engages critically with the key theoretical debates that shape the relationships between the environment, society and international development. By looking at current questions in development theory and their relationship to development practice in the context of the Anthropocene and environmental change, it encourages students to think critically about the ways in which interdisciplinary approaches define issues and problems, and the theoretical viewpoints that inform their actions. The module is taught primarily through seminars: these structure students' learning, and provide an environment in which they can develop their skills in researching, presenting and debating arguments drawn from the academic literature on international development.\n15 credits\n\n\nInternational Development Fieldclass\n\n\nThis optional field class module provides you with the opportunity to explore and engage with development issues through practical fieldwork experiences, and to enhance your understanding of grass-roots development organisations. \n\nCentral to the module is a focus on developing critical reflectivity on the nature of development in a particular globalised and historicised context. You will have the opportunity to practise and build on research skills learnt in Semester 1 as well as dealing with issues of ethics, power and co-produced development research and practice. \n\nYou will work with an International partner, and you will develop transferable skills through teamwork and engagement with a variety of stakeholders.\n\nFor field trips to run we require a minimum number of students to sign up for these modules. This varies depending on the specifics of individual field trips. If this number is not reached, the field trip will be cancelled. To assist with planning, this module must be selected by the end of the Semester One Add/Drop period.\n15 credits\n\n\nManaging Climate Change\n\n\nThis module aims to provide students with a strong understanding of the social and physical science of climate change with relevance to international development.  This understanding is then applied to consider the challenge of living with climate change in the Global South. The module is taught through seminars and lectures. Lectures introduce and impart factual knowledge while seminars allow discussion and an emphasis on applying key concepts to practical situations. Together these structure students' learning, and provide an environment in which they can develop their skills in researching, presenting and debating arguments drawn from the wide ranging literature on climate change.\n15 credits\n\n\nHealth Promotion\n\n\nHealth Promotion enables people to take control over and improve their own health.  It builds on knowledge from behavioural science that individual behaviour and health are determined by the social, physical and economic environment.  This module will consider the nature of health promotion from a global perspective, the associated ideological dilemmas, current understanding of individual and group behaviours, methods of promoting health and the evaluation of health promotion.  The module will use the 5 key principles within the Ottawa Charter applied to health promotion as a framework.  Case studies will be used to give students practical examples of health promotion in different countries.\n15 credits\n\n\nPublic Health Informatics\n\n\nPublic Health Informatics is a module designed to look at how informatics and information technology can be used to help address some of the major issues in public health. Public health informatics was traditionally defined as the systematic application of information and computer science and technology to public health practice, research, and learning (Yasnoff, 2000). In this module, we examine this rapidly changing field, using a combination of lectures, individual and group exercises and self directed learning. Key issues around the local, national and international contributions that technology can make to public health are critically examined and students are given a theoretical and practical grounding in this increasingly important discipline.\n15 credits\n\n\nCommunicable Disease Control\n\n\nHealth protection is one of the cornerstones of public health.  The control of communicable diseases is one of the major functions of health protection.  This module will cover the principles of surveillance, outbreak management, immunisation programmes, and prevention and control of infectious diseases.  It will also present a broad range of common infectious disease topics including HIV, tuberculosis, meningitis, diarrhoeal illnesses and hospital acquired infections.  This module would provide the essential foundations for students intending to undertake the Faculty of Public Health Part A/Diploma examination.\n15 credits\n\n\nUsing Policy to Strengthen Health Systems\n\n\nThe module seeks to build on students' own experiences and knowledge of policy and public health systems. During the module, you will work individually and also in groups to develop a critical understanding of policy within particular public health systems. You will consider how policy to strengthen public health systems is developed and how improvements might be targeted at any combination of the regional, national, district, and community levels.\n\nIn the module, policy is interpreted broadly as 'purposeful and deliberate actions' through which efforts can be made to reshape or address issues within public health systems and is about power and politics (cf. Gilson, 2012). Public health systems are understood both as public health systems (covering, for example, health protection, health promotion and health care public health) and, more narrowly, as health care systems. The module is suitable for students with a broad public health and health care knowledge, but also for those with more limited experience.\n15 credits\n\n\nCapitalism and Crisis\n\n\nDuring this module, you will explore the relationship between capitalism and crisis through the prism of the causes of, and fallout from, the 2008 crash.\n\nYou will unpack the core concepts of the module - capitalism and crisis - and gain a brief historical overview of pre-2008 economic crises to contextualise and compare the main content of the module. You shall then go on to survey competing explanations of the 2008 crisis, by starting narrow (i.e. regulation of banking) and then broadening out (i.e. evolution of capitalism).\n\nBy the end of the module, you will have examined the economic and political fallout of  the 2008 crisis, be able to debate the extent to which the crisis was truly global, and discuss the variety of political responses to the crash.\n30 credits\n\n\nCitizen Participation in Planning and Development\n\n\nRecent decades have seen a proliferation of initiatives to involve citizens in policy-making, planning and urban governance. There is widespread agreement that 'citizen engagement' can play a positive role in democratizing urban development. However, public participation raises a range of significant challenges for urban professional practice. This module will draw on critical debates about the roles citizens and publics can and should play in shaping the city to reflect on the theory and practice of participation. The module is taught through seminars which structure learning, and help students to research case studies of participatory initiatives.\n15 credits\n\n\nUrban Informality\n\n\nThe overall aim of this module is to critically examine informality, with a particular but not exclusive focus on cities of the Global South. The module relies on a mixture of lectures, seminars and student-led group work, with the latter focusing on an in-depth case study of a selected city. It explores patterns and causes of informality and discusses the strengths and limitations of a range of theoretical approaches. It also analyses the success of different real-world urban planning responses (understood in broad terms), including government-led, donor-led and community-focused ones, in addressing key urban issues in the context of informality.\n15 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Core modules - choose from:\n\n\nResearch Foundations with Placement\n\n\nThis module allows students to develop and manage an individual, interdisciplinary research project.  The module aims to help students to develop and apply research skills and an appreciation of the issues involved in managing a research project; to develop an understanding of the role of research in relation to theoretical and practical dimensions of the chosen discipline; and to further and deepen knowledge in their chosen area of international development. The module combines an independent research project with experience of working (in-person or virtually) with a development related organisation.  Students make a detailed analysis of an issue, topic or problem agreed with their host organisation, develop a research proposal, carry out research while on placement, and produce both a dissertation and a shorter consultancy-style report based on their dissertation findings. The module is supported by lectures, seminars, fieldwork and one-to-one supervision.  It includes core research methods required to undertake a dissertation at Masters level in the field of International Development, which are assessed through a 2,500-word research proposal in the Spring, and a final 10,000-word dissertation alongside the 2,500-word placement report at the end of Summer.\n60 credits\n\n\nResearch Foundations without Placement\n\n\nThis module allows students to develop and manage an individual, interdisciplinary research project.  The module aims to help students to develop and apply research skills and an appreciation of the issues involved in managing a research project; to develop an understanding of the role of research in relation to theoretical and practical dimensions of the chosen discipline; and to further and deepen knowledge in their chosen area of international development. The module involves a supervised research project carried out either independently or as an attachment to a wider UoS research project.  Students make a detailed analysis of an issue, topic or problem agreed with their dissertation supervisor, develop a research proposal, carry out research, and produce a dissertation.  In the case of students working with a UoS research project, they will also engage with the Research Lead (who will usually, but not always, be their supervisor). The module is supported by lectures, seminars, fieldwork and one-to-one supervision.  It includes core research methods required to undertake a dissertation at Masters level in the field of International Development, which are assessed through a 2,500-word research proposal in the Spring, and a final 12,500-word dissertation at the end of Summer.\n60 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content of our courses is reviewed annually to make sure it's up-to-date and relevant.

Working across the School of Geography and Planning and the School of Medicine and Population Health, you'll develop an understanding of the interventions necessary to improve the health of communities.The course is rooted in principles of interdisciplinary learning, decolonising knowledge, connecting theory with policy and practice. You'll also have the flexibility to tailor the course to you own interests.Through this approach it offers a unique combination of academic excellence, tailored professional skills teaching, an optional field class, and a research-based dissertation based on placements, research collaborations or independent research.Core modules will teach you about changing ideas of ‘development’ since the mid-twentieth century and how these have translated into very different policy approaches and outcomes. You'll learn about poverty and how it has changed, about how development ideas and processes connect to questions of gender, culture and race, about how processes such as migration, urbanisation and technological evolution intersect with development, and about the global governance of international development.You'll have the opportunity to build a range of professional skills, and will be trained in core research methods in order to undertake an individual piece of original research. Our placement-based dissertation option also enables you to gain valuable work experience.Optional modules from across the University are also available. These include subjects as diverse as food security, public health, urban development, and climate change.An optional international field class encourages you to engage with overseas development and community organisations through an intensive week of activities. We also offer a lower cost and more sustainable UK-based ‘hybrid’ field class as an alternative. International field class locations are subject to variation and subject to the number of students participating, but previous destinations have included Peru, Nepal and South Africa.The costs of optional field classes modules and placements are not included in your tuition fees. A limited amount of funding, accessed through a competitive process, is available to students to help finance field classes.Field class\n\n\nAn optional international field class encourages you to engage with overseas development and community organisations through an intensive week of activities.\nWe also offer a lower cost and more sustainable UK-based ‘hybrid’ field class as an alternative.\nInternational field class locations are subject to variation and subject to the number of students participating, but previous destinations have included Peru, Nepal and South Africa.\nThe costs of optional field classes modules and placements are not included in your tuition fees.

Students pursued research projects around themes of gender, health, migration, earthquake disaster recovery, community forestry and climate change. This research had a direct impact through a final dissemination event which in recent years involved national political and media attention as well as regional and local stakeholders.The field class is an amazing part of the masters programme, which allows you to consolidate the theory and ideas learnt in lectures, in the field. As well as preparing you for the dissertation it is also a great chance to meet and learn from students of different cultures in a new and interesting environment.HelenaTanzaniaThe Tanzania field class gave students practical experience of field research. Working with our NGO partner KEDA, students were based in rural communities around Mt Kilimanjaro.They researched a range of issues that affect local communities such as health, environmental change and poverty alleviation among smallholder farmers. Each year students fed back to district officials and previously had even been interviewed for National TV.The field class in Tanzania provided the incredible opportunity to bring case studies we had always read about in books and lectures to life through hands-on fieldwork. I was able to learn about issues in water, health and sanitation through the voices of local people. Conducting research in the rich and vibrant culture of Tanzania was an unforgettable experience.ShahreenEcuadorThe Ecuador field class gave students the opportunity to work closely with our local partner Intercultural Outreach Initiative, which is based on the Island Isabela in the Galapagos Islands. Our students gained experience in field research by exploring a range of issues that affect the local communities such as food security, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) issues and ocean plastic pollution. Each year students feed back to district officials and local stakeholders.You can read a blog from one of our students about a virtual field class.The virtual field class provided an opportunity to experience the challenges of international fieldwork, and allowed us to develop skills in adapting research to changing circumstances and using video interviews for data collection, which will be useful skills for the future! It was a great way to gain an understanding and insight into the situation around plastics in the Galapagos, despite not being able to visit!EllePlacement\n\n\nThe dissertation with placement gives you valuable practical experience of working in a development organisation and engaging with development issues.\nYou'll spend six to eight weeks in June or July based in a host organisation, where you'll carry out a research project identified by the organisation and approved by the University.

From May of the year of entry, formal programme regulations will be available in our Programme Regulations Finder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Autumn semester\n    \n\n      Spring semester\n    \n\n      Summer\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Core modules:\n\n\nIntroduction to Research Methods\n\n\nThis module is offered across several programmes. Learning activities for the module are tailored to your individual specialist areas to provide learning that is relevant and specific to your chosen degree programme.\n\n\n\nThis module provides students with an introduction to quantitative and qualitative research methods; it covers all stages of the research process from planning and design and research ethics and public and patient involvement, through to data collection and analysis and dissemination stages. It is specifically designed for students who do not have prior research experience and would be suitable for students from a range of backgrounds, but is particularly relevant to those interested in applied health related research. The course also provides a foundation for further learning in specific research methods.\n15 credits\n\n\nCritical Reflections in Global Health\n\n\nGlobal health has been described as the art and science of preventing disease, prolonging life, and promoting health through the organised efforts of society, with the goal being the attainment of biological, physical, and mental well-being of all members of society. In this module we take an inter-disciplinary approach to explore these themes.\n\nAligned with the themes of our key reader (7th edition of the Oxford Textbook of Global Public Health) we will consider some of the key concepts of global health, explore some of the determinants of health, and consider some of the key function / methods applied to address global health issues. We will then reflect on these themes in relation to the practice of global health through the lens of specific health challenges. Throughout the module themes such as inequalities in health, complexities in our response, and the political, social, and economic context within which we work will be repeatedly raised and discussed. \n\nIn delivering this module we are excited to have secured the expertise of regional, national, and international leaders and experts who will share their learnings on a diverse range of subjects that include socioeconomic and health inequalities, health intelligence, and sexual and reproductive health. In relation to the sharing of experiences and expertise, and in stimulating engaged discussion, throughout the module you will be encouraged to develop and use a reflective learning approach to consider shifts in your perception and understanding of the issues raised.\n15 credits\n\n\nIdeas and Practice in International Development\n\n\nThis module introduces students to key theoretical debates in international development. Co-taught by the Departments of Geography, Politics, Urban Studies and Planning, and Sociological Studies, it takes an interdisciplinary approach to exploring how thinking about development has changed over time, and why it has changed. The module also encourages students to think about the relationship between development theory and development practice.  It is spread over two semesters, in order to maximise the synergies between the core content of this module and the various other core and optional modules that students will take across the year.  The first semester focuses on the overarching questions of how development has been understood and conceptualised from the colonial period to the present. The changing development paradigms presented through weekly lectures are explored in depth through fortnightly seminars, each of which focuses on a set of key questions about changing theoretical perspectives and their implications for policy. The second semester then shifts focus onto a set of critical issues for policy and practice, including (for example) global health, migration, technology, urbanization and development finance.  The overall aim of the module is to build students' understanding of the origins of the idea of international development, changing debates about its meaning and purpose, and the implications of these for policy and practice.\n30 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Optional modules:\n\n\nTheory and Debates in Food Security and Food Justice\n\n\nFood Security and Food Justice are areas of increasing importance at local, national, transnational and global scales. Political and non-political agents at multiple scales have recognised that Global Hunger and Food Security (of which Food Justice is a primary component) is a key challenge requiring urgent interdisciplinary investigation and problem solving. There remains limited agreement as to how best to approach these issues. This module provides students with a background to the problems encompassed within the food security/food justice nexus by drawing on academic and policy debates that focus on both the macro as well as the micro impacts. By looking across food systems, the module also critically evaluates different strategies for mitigating the impacts of food insecurity and injustice.  In addition to academic, knowledge and critical thinking skills, the module will help students to develop the following attributes: Communication, Networking, Collaboration, Influencing, Inclusivity, Defining Purpose, and Growth Mindset.\n15 credits\n\n\nProfessional Skills for Development\n\n\nIn this module, which is taught across several departments drawing in a range of multi-disciplinary expertise, students gain a critically engaged understanding of professional practice in international development and develop a range of professional skills for future career paths.  Through the module students will learn to apply academic training to real-world situations, with a strong focus on employability-related skills.\n\n\n\nStudents will be taught about a set of key transferable and employability skills in keeping with the Sheffield Graduate Attributes before being given the option to choose between one of three specialist skill development tracks for hands-on group work.   The key transferable skills covered will include communications, project design and fundraising, policy analysis and consultancy work, ethics and cultural sensitivity.  Whichever of the specialist tracks they choose, students will work on a group-based project output and an individual written assessment.  While acquiring some specialist skills, all students will reflect on all key transferable skills offered in the first half of the module.\n15 credits\n\n\nThe Science of Environmental Change\n\n\nThis module gives students a critical understanding of the science behind historical and recent environmental change. The module covers the core debates in environmental change, the science behind these changes, methods for detecting environmental change, and the impacts of these changes, and projected future changes.\n15 credits\n\n\nEpidemiology\n\n\nEpidemiology is the discipline underpinning both effective public health practice and research into the causes, control and prevention of disease.  Knowledge and understanding of epidemiological concepts and methods is a basic requirement for effective public health practice. \n\nThis module will provide an introduction to epidemiology covering key epidemiological concepts; measures of disease; association and causation; confounding and bias.  It will also introduce research designs including cross-sectional, ecological, cohort, case-control and intervention studies and introduce population health measures such as screening.\n15 credits\n\n\nDisaster and Emergency Management\n\n\nDisasters and emergencies can strike any community.  It is not a question of whether a disaster will occur but when.  However, the likelihood, scale and impact of a disaster can be minimized through appropriate emergency planning, preparation and response by the community, governmental and non-governmental organisations.  This module will cover the key concepts of disaster and emergency management, explore some of the contemporary issues and develop students' knowledge and skills in this field.\n15 credits\n\n\nFoundations of GIS\n\n\nThis module introduces students to the core principles and skills of GIS. It covers the major sources of data used to study the lived environment and the variety of ways it can be displayed to aid both understanding and analysis. The module has a particular focus on techniques used in the analysis of socio-economic and demographic data and its potential applications. It is taught through a combination of lectures and practical workshops using ArcGIS software.\n15 credits\n\n\nThe Digital Self\n\n\nThis module explores how gender, age, race, class and other identities are being reimagined in what various commentators have called a 'social media age'. It provides students with an in-depth understanding of social media platforms, roles in people's identity negotiations, examining users' social media identities in different global contexts, and paying close attention to the intersections between different identities. It reviews debates about self and  identity formations from the earliest digital media moments and considers contemporary concerns, such as: anonymity and agency; selfies and influencers; online censorship, resistance and collective identities; social media fandoms; disconnection and digital detox\n15 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Optional modules:\n\n\nUK-Based Field Class\n\n\nThis optional, UK-based field class provides you with the opportunity to explore and engage with development issues through practical fieldwork experiences. Central to the module is a focus on developing critical reflectivity on the nature of development in a particular globalised and historicised context. You will have the opportunity to practise and build on research skills learnt in Semester 1 as well as dealing with issues of ethics, power and co-produced development research and practice. You will work in-person with UK partners or conduct remote or hybrid research with overseas partners, you will develop transferable skills through teamwork and engagement with a variety of stakeholders.\n\nFor field trips to run we require a minimum number of students to sign up for these modules. This varies depending on the specifics of individual field trips. If this number is not reached, the field trip will be cancelled. To assist with planning, this module must be selected by the end of the Semester One Add/Drop period.\n15 credits\n\n\nEnvironment, Society and Development: Key Issues, Debates and Concepts\n\n\nThis module engages critically with the key theoretical debates that shape the relationships between the environment, society and international development. By looking at current questions in development theory and their relationship to development practice in the context of the Anthropocene and environmental change, it encourages students to think critically about the ways in which interdisciplinary approaches define issues and problems, and the theoretical viewpoints that inform their actions. The module is taught primarily through seminars: these structure students' learning, and provide an environment in which they can develop their skills in researching, presenting and debating arguments drawn from the academic literature on international development.\n15 credits\n\n\nInternational Development Fieldclass\n\n\nThis optional field class module provides you with the opportunity to explore and engage with development issues through practical fieldwork experiences, and to enhance your understanding of grass-roots development organisations. \n\nCentral to the module is a focus on developing critical reflectivity on the nature of development in a particular globalised and historicised context. You will have the opportunity to practise and build on research skills learnt in Semester 1 as well as dealing with issues of ethics, power and co-produced development research and practice. \n\nYou will work with an International partner, and you will develop transferable skills through teamwork and engagement with a variety of stakeholders.\n\nFor field trips to run we require a minimum number of students to sign up for these modules. This varies depending on the specifics of individual field trips. If this number is not reached, the field trip will be cancelled. To assist with planning, this module must be selected by the end of the Semester One Add/Drop period.\n15 credits\n\n\nManaging Climate Change\n\n\nThis module aims to provide students with a strong understanding of the social and physical science of climate change with relevance to international development.  This understanding is then applied to consider the challenge of living with climate change in the Global South. The module is taught through seminars and lectures. Lectures introduce and impart factual knowledge while seminars allow discussion and an emphasis on applying key concepts to practical situations. Together these structure students' learning, and provide an environment in which they can develop their skills in researching, presenting and debating arguments drawn from the wide ranging literature on climate change.\n15 credits\n\n\nHealth Promotion\n\n\nHealth Promotion enables people to take control over and improve their own health.  It builds on knowledge from behavioural science that individual behaviour and health are determined by the social, physical and economic environment.  This module will consider the nature of health promotion from a global perspective, the associated ideological dilemmas, current understanding of individual and group behaviours, methods of promoting health and the evaluation of health promotion.  The module will use the 5 key principles within the Ottawa Charter applied to health promotion as a framework.  Case studies will be used to give students practical examples of health promotion in different countries.\n15 credits\n\n\nPublic Health Informatics\n\n\nPublic Health Informatics is a module designed to look at how informatics and information technology can be used to help address some of the major issues in public health. Public health informatics was traditionally defined as the systematic application of information and computer science and technology to public health practice, research, and learning (Yasnoff, 2000). In this module, we examine this rapidly changing field, using a combination of lectures, individual and group exercises and self directed learning. Key issues around the local, national and international contributions that technology can make to public health are critically examined and students are given a theoretical and practical grounding in this increasingly important discipline.\n15 credits\n\n\nCommunicable Disease Control\n\n\nHealth protection is one of the cornerstones of public health.  The control of communicable diseases is one of the major functions of health protection.  This module will cover the principles of surveillance, outbreak management, immunisation programmes, and prevention and control of infectious diseases.  It will also present a broad range of common infectious disease topics including HIV, tuberculosis, meningitis, diarrhoeal illnesses and hospital acquired infections.  This module would provide the essential foundations for students intending to undertake the Faculty of Public Health Part A/Diploma examination.\n15 credits\n\n\nUsing Policy to Strengthen Health Systems\n\n\nThe module seeks to build on students' own experiences and knowledge of policy and public health systems. During the module, you will work individually and also in groups to develop a critical understanding of policy within particular public health systems. You will consider how policy to strengthen public health systems is developed and how improvements might be targeted at any combination of the regional, national, district, and community levels.\n\nIn the module, policy is interpreted broadly as 'purposeful and deliberate actions' through which efforts can be made to reshape or address issues within public health systems and is about power and politics (cf. Gilson, 2012). Public health systems are understood both as public health systems (covering, for example, health protection, health promotion and health care public health) and, more narrowly, as health care systems. The module is suitable for students with a broad public health and health care knowledge, but also for those with more limited experience.\n15 credits\n\n\nCapitalism and Crisis\n\n\nDuring this module, you will explore the relationship between capitalism and crisis through the prism of the causes of, and fallout from, the 2008 crash.\n\nYou will unpack the core concepts of the module - capitalism and crisis - and gain a brief historical overview of pre-2008 economic crises to contextualise and compare the main content of the module. You shall then go on to survey competing explanations of the 2008 crisis, by starting narrow (i.e. regulation of banking) and then broadening out (i.e. evolution of capitalism).\n\nBy the end of the module, you will have examined the economic and political fallout of  the 2008 crisis, be able to debate the extent to which the crisis was truly global, and discuss the variety of political responses to the crash.\n30 credits\n\n\nCitizen Participation in Planning and Development\n\n\nRecent decades have seen a proliferation of initiatives to involve citizens in policy-making, planning and urban governance. There is widespread agreement that 'citizen engagement' can play a positive role in democratizing urban development. However, public participation raises a range of significant challenges for urban professional practice. This module will draw on critical debates about the roles citizens and publics can and should play in shaping the city to reflect on the theory and practice of participation. The module is taught through seminars which structure learning, and help students to research case studies of participatory initiatives.\n15 credits\n\n\nUrban Informality\n\n\nThe overall aim of this module is to critically examine informality, with a particular but not exclusive focus on cities of the Global South. The module relies on a mixture of lectures, seminars and student-led group work, with the latter focusing on an in-depth case study of a selected city. It explores patterns and causes of informality and discusses the strengths and limitations of a range of theoretical approaches. It also analyses the success of different real-world urban planning responses (understood in broad terms), including government-led, donor-led and community-focused ones, in addressing key urban issues in the context of informality.\n15 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Core modules - choose from:\n\n\nResearch Foundations with Placement\n\n\nThis module allows students to develop and manage an individual, interdisciplinary research project.  The module aims to help students to develop and apply research skills and an appreciation of the issues involved in managing a research project; to develop an understanding of the role of research in relation to theoretical and practical dimensions of the chosen discipline; and to further and deepen knowledge in their chosen area of international development. The module combines an independent research project with experience of working (in-person or virtually) with a development related organisation.  Students make a detailed analysis of an issue, topic or problem agreed with their host organisation, develop a research proposal, carry out research while on placement, and produce both a dissertation and a shorter consultancy-style report based on their dissertation findings. The module is supported by lectures, seminars, fieldwork and one-to-one supervision.  It includes core research methods required to undertake a dissertation at Masters level in the field of International Development, which are assessed through a 2,500-word research proposal in the Spring, and a final 10,000-word dissertation alongside the 2,500-word placement report at the end of Summer.\n60 credits\n\n\nResearch Foundations without Placement\n\n\nThis module allows students to develop and manage an individual, interdisciplinary research project.  The module aims to help students to develop and apply research skills and an appreciation of the issues involved in managing a research project; to develop an understanding of the role of research in relation to theoretical and practical dimensions of the chosen discipline; and to further and deepen knowledge in their chosen area of international development. The module involves a supervised research project carried out either independently or as an attachment to a wider UoS research project.  Students make a detailed analysis of an issue, topic or problem agreed with their dissertation supervisor, develop a research proposal, carry out research, and produce a dissertation.  In the case of students working with a UoS research project, they will also engage with the Research Lead (who will usually, but not always, be their supervisor). The module is supported by lectures, seminars, fieldwork and one-to-one supervision.  It includes core research methods required to undertake a dissertation at Masters level in the field of International Development, which are assessed through a 2,500-word research proposal in the Spring, and a final 12,500-word dissertation at the end of Summer.\n60 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content of our courses is reviewed annually to make sure it's up-to-date and relevant.

Working across the School of Geography and Planning and the School of Medicine and Population Health, you'll develop an understanding of the interventions necessary to improve the health of communities.The course is rooted in principles of interdisciplinary learning, decolonising knowledge, connecting theory with policy and practice. You'll also have the flexibility to tailor the course to you own interests.Through this approach it offers a unique combination of academic excellence, tailored professional skills teaching, an optional field class, and a research-based dissertation based on placements, research collaborations or independent research.Core modules will teach you about changing ideas of ‘development’ since the mid-twentieth century and how these have translated into very different policy approaches and outcomes. You'll learn about poverty and how it has changed, about how development ideas and processes connect to questions of gender, culture and race, about how processes such as migration, urbanisation and technological evolution intersect with development, and about the global governance of international development.You'll have the opportunity to build a range of professional skills, and will be trained in core research methods in order to undertake an individual piece of original research. Our placement-based dissertation option also enables you to gain valuable work experience.Optional modules from across the University are also available. These include subjects as diverse as food security, public health, urban development, and climate change.An optional international field class encourages you to engage with overseas development and community organisations through an intensive week of activities. We also offer a lower cost and more sustainable UK-based ‘hybrid’ field class as an alternative. International field class locations are subject to variation and subject to the number of students participating, but previous destinations have included Peru, Nepal and South Africa.The costs of optional field classes modules and placements are not included in your tuition fees. A limited amount of funding, accessed through a competitive process, is available to students to help finance field classes.Field class\n\n\nAn optional international field class encourages you to engage with overseas development and community organisations through an intensive week of activities.\nWe also offer a lower cost and more sustainable UK-based ‘hybrid’ field class as an alternative.\nInternational field class locations are subject to variation and subject to the number of students participating, but previous destinations have included Peru, Nepal and South Africa.\nThe costs of optional field classes modules and placements are not included in your tuition fees.

Students pursued research projects around themes of gender, health, migration, earthquake disaster recovery, community forestry and climate change. This research had a direct impact through a final dissemination event which in recent years involved national political and media attention as well as regional and local stakeholders.The field class is an amazing part of the masters programme, which allows you to consolidate the theory and ideas learnt in lectures, in the field. As well as preparing you for the dissertation it is also a great chance to meet and learn from students of different cultures in a new and interesting environment.HelenaTanzaniaThe Tanzania field class gave students practical experience of field research. Working with our NGO partner KEDA, students were based in rural communities around Mt Kilimanjaro.They researched a range of issues that affect local communities such as health, environmental change and poverty alleviation among smallholder farmers. Each year students fed back to district officials and previously had even been interviewed for National TV.The field class in Tanzania provided the incredible opportunity to bring case studies we had always read about in books and lectures to life through hands-on fieldwork. I was able to learn about issues in water, health and sanitation through the voices of local people. Conducting research in the rich and vibrant culture of Tanzania was an unforgettable experience.ShahreenEcuadorThe Ecuador field class gave students the opportunity to work closely with our local partner Intercultural Outreach Initiative, which is based on the Island Isabela in the Galapagos Islands. Our students gained experience in field research by exploring a range of issues that affect the local communities such as food security, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) issues and ocean plastic pollution. Each year students feed back to district officials and local stakeholders.You can read a blog from one of our students about a virtual field class.The virtual field class provided an opportunity to experience the challenges of international fieldwork, and allowed us to develop skills in adapting research to changing circumstances and using video interviews for data collection, which will be useful skills for the future! It was a great way to gain an understanding and insight into the situation around plastics in the Galapagos, despite not being able to visit!EllePlacement\n\n\nThe dissertation with placement gives you valuable practical experience of working in a development organisation and engaging with development issues.\nYou'll spend six to eight weeks in June or July based in a host organisation, where you'll carry out a research project identified by the organisation and approved by the University.

Learning activities for the module are tailored to your individual specialist areas to provide learning that is relevant and specific to your chosen degree programme.\n\n\n\nThis module provides students with an introduction to quantitative and qualitative research methods; it covers all stages of the research process from planning and design and research ethics and public and patient involvement, through to data collection and analysis and dissemination stages. It is specifically designed for students who do not have prior research experience and would be suitable for students from a range of backgrounds, but is particularly relevant to those interested in applied health related research. The course also provides a foundation for further learning in specific research methods.\n15 credits\n\n\nCritical Reflections in Global Health\n\n\nGlobal health has been described as the art and science of preventing disease, prolonging life, and promoting health through the organised efforts of society, with the goal being the attainment of biological, physical, and mental well-being of all members of society. In this module we take an inter-disciplinary approach to explore these themes.\n\nAligned with the themes of our key reader (7th edition of the Oxford Textbook of Global Public Health) we will consider some of the key concepts of global health, explore some of the determinants of health, and consider some of the key function / methods applied to address global health issues. We will then reflect on these themes in relation to the practice of global health through the lens of specific health challenges. Throughout the module themes such as inequalities in health, complexities in our response, and the political, social, and economic context within which we work will be repeatedly raised and discussed. \n\nIn delivering this module we are excited to have secured the expertise of regional, national, and international leaders and experts who will share their learnings on a diverse range of subjects that include socioeconomic and health inequalities, health intelligence, and sexual and reproductive health. In relation to the sharing of experiences and expertise, and in stimulating engaged discussion, throughout the module you will be encouraged to develop and use a reflective learning approach to consider shifts in your perception and understanding of the issues raised.\n15 credits\n\n\nIdeas and Practice in International Development\n\n\nThis module introduces students to key theoretical debates in international development. Co-taught by the Departments of Geography, Politics, Urban Studies and Planning, and Sociological Studies, it takes an interdisciplinary approach to exploring how thinking about development has changed over time, and why it has changed. The module also encourages students to think about the relationship between development theory and development practice.  It is spread over two semesters, in order to maximise the synergies between the core content of this module and the various other core and optional modules that students will take across the year.  The first semester focuses on the overarching questions of how development has been understood and conceptualised from the colonial period to the present. The changing development paradigms presented through weekly lectures are explored in depth through fortnightly seminars, each of which focuses on a set of key questions about changing theoretical perspectives and their implications for policy. The second semester then shifts focus onto a set of critical issues for policy and practice, including (for example) global health, migration, technology, urbanization and development finance.  The overall aim of the module is to build students' understanding of the origins of the idea of international development, changing debates about its meaning and purpose, and the implications of these for policy and practice.\n30 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Optional modules:\n\n\nTheory and Debates in Food Security and Food Justice\n\n\nFood Security and Food Justice are areas of increasing importance at local, national, transnational and global scales. Political and non-political agents at multiple scales have recognised that Global Hunger and Food Security (of which Food Justice is a primary component) is a key challenge requiring urgent interdisciplinary investigation and problem solving. There remains limited agreement as to how best to approach these issues. This module provides students with a background to the problems encompassed within the food security/food justice nexus by drawing on academic and policy debates that focus on both the macro as well as the micro impacts. By looking across food systems, the module also critically evaluates different strategies for mitigating the impacts of food insecurity and injustice.  In addition to academic, knowledge and critical thinking skills, the module will help students to develop the following attributes: Communication, Networking, Collaboration, Influencing, Inclusivity, Defining Purpose, and Growth Mindset.\n15 credits\n\n\nProfessional Skills for Development\n\n\nIn this module, which is taught across several departments drawing in a range of multi-disciplinary expertise, students gain a critically engaged understanding of professional practice in international development and develop a range of professional skills for future career paths.  Through the module students will learn to apply academic training to real-world situations, with a strong focus on employability-related skills.\n\n\n\nStudents will be taught about a set of key transferable and employability skills in keeping with the Sheffield Graduate Attributes before being given the option to choose between one of three specialist skill development tracks for hands-on group work.   The key transferable skills covered will include communications, project design and fundraising, policy analysis and consultancy work, ethics and cultural sensitivity.  Whichever of the specialist tracks they choose, students will work on a group-based project output and an individual written assessment.  While acquiring some specialist skills, all students will reflect on all key transferable skills offered in the first half of the module.\n15 credits\n\n\nThe Science of Environmental Change\n\n\nThis module gives students a critical understanding of the science behind historical and recent environmental change. The module covers the core debates in environmental change, the science behind these changes, methods for detecting environmental change, and the impacts of these changes, and projected future changes.\n15 credits\n\n\nEpidemiology\n\n\nEpidemiology is the discipline underpinning both effective public health practice and research into the causes, control and prevention of disease.  Knowledge and understanding of epidemiological concepts and methods is a basic requirement for effective public health practice. \n\nThis module will provide an introduction to epidemiology covering key epidemiological concepts; measures of disease; association and causation; confounding and bias.  It will also introduce research designs including cross-sectional, ecological, cohort, case-control and intervention studies and introduce population health measures such as screening.\n15 credits\n\n\nDisaster and Emergency Management\n\n\nDisasters and emergencies can strike any community.  It is not a question of whether a disaster will occur but when.  However, the likelihood, scale and impact of a disaster can be minimized through appropriate emergency planning, preparation and response by the community, governmental and non-governmental organisations.  This module will cover the key concepts of disaster and emergency management, explore some of the contemporary issues and develop students' knowledge and skills in this field.\n15 credits\n\n\nFoundations of GIS\n\n\nThis module introduces students to the core principles and skills of GIS. It covers the major sources of data used to study the lived environment and the variety of ways it can be displayed to aid both understanding and analysis. The module has a particular focus on techniques used in the analysis of socio-economic and demographic data and its potential applications. It is taught through a combination of lectures and practical workshops using ArcGIS software.\n15 credits\n\n\nThe Digital Self\n\n\nThis module explores how gender, age, race, class and other identities are being reimagined in what various commentators have called a 'social media age'. It provides students with an in-depth understanding of social media platforms, roles in people's identity negotiations, examining users' social media identities in different global contexts, and paying close attention to the intersections between different identities. It reviews debates about self and  identity formations from the earliest digital media moments and considers contemporary concerns, such as: anonymity and agency; selfies and influencers; online censorship, resistance and collective identities; social media fandoms; disconnection and digital detox\n15 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Optional modules:\n\n\nUK-Based Field Class\n\n\nThis optional, UK-based field class provides you with the opportunity to explore and engage with development issues through practical fieldwork experiences. Central to the module is a focus on developing critical reflectivity on the nature of development in a particular globalised and historicised context. You will have the opportunity to practise and build on research skills learnt in Semester 1 as well as dealing with issues of ethics, power and co-produced development research and practice. You will work in-person with UK partners or conduct remote or hybrid research with overseas partners, you will develop transferable skills through teamwork and engagement with a variety of stakeholders.\n\nFor field trips to run we require a minimum number of students to sign up for these modules. This varies depending on the specifics of individual field trips. If this number is not reached, the field trip will be cancelled. To assist with planning, this module must be selected by the end of the Semester One Add/Drop period.\n15 credits\n\n\nEnvironment, Society and Development: Key Issues, Debates and Concepts\n\n\nThis module engages critically with the key theoretical debates that shape the relationships between the environment, society and international development. By looking at current questions in development theory and their relationship to development practice in the context of the Anthropocene and environmental change, it encourages students to think critically about the ways in which interdisciplinary approaches define issues and problems, and the theoretical viewpoints that inform their actions. The module is taught primarily through seminars: these structure students' learning, and provide an environment in which they can develop their skills in researching, presenting and debating arguments drawn from the academic literature on international development.\n15 credits\n\n\nInternational Development Fieldclass\n\n\nThis optional field class module provides you with the opportunity to explore and engage with development issues through practical fieldwork experiences, and to enhance your understanding of grass-roots development organisations. \n\nCentral to the module is a focus on developing critical reflectivity on the nature of development in a particular globalised and historicised context. You will have the opportunity to practise and build on research skills learnt in Semester 1 as well as dealing with issues of ethics, power and co-produced development research and practice. \n\nYou will work with an International partner, and you will develop transferable skills through teamwork and engagement with a variety of stakeholders.\n\nFor field trips to run we require a minimum number of students to sign up for these modules. This varies depending on the specifics of individual field trips. If this number is not reached, the field trip will be cancelled. To assist with planning, this module must be selected by the end of the Semester One Add/Drop period.\n15 credits\n\n\nManaging Climate Change\n\n\nThis module aims to provide students with a strong understanding of the social and physical science of climate change with relevance to international development.  This understanding is then applied to consider the challenge of living with climate change in the Global South. The module is taught through seminars and lectures. Lectures introduce and impart factual knowledge while seminars allow discussion and an emphasis on applying key concepts to practical situations. Together these structure students' learning, and provide an environment in which they can develop their skills in researching, presenting and debating arguments drawn from the wide ranging literature on climate change.\n15 credits\n\n\nHealth Promotion\n\n\nHealth Promotion enables people to take control over and improve their own health.  It builds on knowledge from behavioural science that individual behaviour and health are determined by the social, physical and economic environment.  This module will consider the nature of health promotion from a global perspective, the associated ideological dilemmas, current understanding of individual and group behaviours, methods of promoting health and the evaluation of health promotion.  The module will use the 5 key principles within the Ottawa Charter applied to health promotion as a framework.  Case studies will be used to give students practical examples of health promotion in different countries.\n15 credits\n\n\nPublic Health Informatics\n\n\nPublic Health Informatics is a module designed to look at how informatics and information technology can be used to help address some of the major issues in public health. Public health informatics was traditionally defined as the systematic application of information and computer science and technology to public health practice, research, and learning (Yasnoff, 2000). In this module, we examine this rapidly changing field, using a combination of lectures, individual and group exercises and self directed learning. Key issues around the local, national and international contributions that technology can make to public health are critically examined and students are given a theoretical and practical grounding in this increasingly important discipline.\n15 credits\n\n\nCommunicable Disease Control\n\n\nHealth protection is one of the cornerstones of public health.  The control of communicable diseases is one of the major functions of health protection.  This module will cover the principles of surveillance, outbreak management, immunisation programmes, and prevention and control of infectious diseases.  It will also present a broad range of common infectious disease topics including HIV, tuberculosis, meningitis, diarrhoeal illnesses and hospital acquired infections.  This module would provide the essential foundations for students intending to undertake the Faculty of Public Health Part A/Diploma examination.\n15 credits\n\n\nUsing Policy to Strengthen Health Systems\n\n\nThe module seeks to build on students' own experiences and knowledge of policy and public health systems. During the module, you will work individually and also in groups to develop a critical understanding of policy within particular public health systems. You will consider how policy to strengthen public health systems is developed and how improvements might be targeted at any combination of the regional, national, district, and community levels.\n\nIn the module, policy is interpreted broadly as 'purposeful and deliberate actions' through which efforts can be made to reshape or address issues within public health systems and is about power and politics (cf. Gilson, 2012). Public health systems are understood both as public health systems (covering, for example, health protection, health promotion and health care public health) and, more narrowly, as health care systems. The module is suitable for students with a broad public health and health care knowledge, but also for those with more limited experience.\n15 credits\n\n\nCapitalism and Crisis\n\n\nDuring this module, you will explore the relationship between capitalism and crisis through the prism of the causes of, and fallout from, the 2008 crash.\n\nYou will unpack the core concepts of the module - capitalism and crisis - and gain a brief historical overview of pre-2008 economic crises to contextualise and compare the main content of the module. You shall then go on to survey competing explanations of the 2008 crisis, by starting narrow (i.e. regulation of banking) and then broadening out (i.e. evolution of capitalism).\n\nBy the end of the module, you will have examined the economic and political fallout of  the 2008 crisis, be able to debate the extent to which the crisis was truly global, and discuss the variety of political responses to the crash.\n30 credits\n\n\nCitizen Participation in Planning and Development\n\n\nRecent decades have seen a proliferation of initiatives to involve citizens in policy-making, planning and urban governance. There is widespread agreement that 'citizen engagement' can play a positive role in democratizing urban development. However, public participation raises a range of significant challenges for urban professional practice. This module will draw on critical debates about the roles citizens and publics can and should play in shaping the city to reflect on the theory and practice of participation. The module is taught through seminars which structure learning, and help students to research case studies of participatory initiatives.\n15 credits\n\n\nUrban Informality\n\n\nThe overall aim of this module is to critically examine informality, with a particular but not exclusive focus on cities of the Global South. The module relies on a mixture of lectures, seminars and student-led group work, with the latter focusing on an in-depth case study of a selected city. It explores patterns and causes of informality and discusses the strengths and limitations of a range of theoretical approaches. It also analyses the success of different real-world urban planning responses (understood in broad terms), including government-led, donor-led and community-focused ones, in addressing key urban issues in the context of informality.\n15 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Core modules - choose from:\n\n\nResearch Foundations with Placement\n\n\nThis module allows students to develop and manage an individual, interdisciplinary research project.  The module aims to help students to develop and apply research skills and an appreciation of the issues involved in managing a research project; to develop an understanding of the role of research in relation to theoretical and practical dimensions of the chosen discipline; and to further and deepen knowledge in their chosen area of international development. The module combines an independent research project with experience of working (in-person or virtually) with a development related organisation.  Students make a detailed analysis of an issue, topic or problem agreed with their host organisation, develop a research proposal, carry out research while on placement, and produce both a dissertation and a shorter consultancy-style report based on their dissertation findings. The module is supported by lectures, seminars, fieldwork and one-to-one supervision.  It includes core research methods required to undertake a dissertation at Masters level in the field of International Development, which are assessed through a 2,500-word research proposal in the Spring, and a final 10,000-word dissertation alongside the 2,500-word placement report at the end of Summer.\n60 credits\n\n\nResearch Foundations without Placement\n\n\nThis module allows students to develop and manage an individual, interdisciplinary research project.  The module aims to help students to develop and apply research skills and an appreciation of the issues involved in managing a research project; to develop an understanding of the role of research in relation to theoretical and practical dimensions of the chosen discipline; and to further and deepen knowledge in their chosen area of international development. The module involves a supervised research project carried out either independently or as an attachment to a wider UoS research project.  Students make a detailed analysis of an issue, topic or problem agreed with their dissertation supervisor, develop a research proposal, carry out research, and produce a dissertation.  In the case of students working with a UoS research project, they will also engage with the Research Lead (who will usually, but not always, be their supervisor). The module is supported by lectures, seminars, fieldwork and one-to-one supervision.  It includes core research methods required to undertake a dissertation at Masters level in the field of International Development, which are assessed through a 2,500-word research proposal in the Spring, and a final 12,500-word dissertation at the end of Summer.\n60 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content of our courses is reviewed annually to make sure it's up-to-date and relevant. Individual modules are occasionally updated or withdrawn.

Working across the School of Geography and Planning and the School of Medicine and Population Health, you'll develop an understanding of the interventions necessary to improve the health of communities.The course is rooted in principles of interdisciplinary learning, decolonising knowledge, connecting theory with policy and practice. You'll also have the flexibility to tailor the course to you own interests.Through this approach it offers a unique combination of academic excellence, tailored professional skills teaching, an optional field class, and a research-based dissertation based on placements, research collaborations or independent research.Core modules will teach you about changing ideas of ‘development’ since the mid-twentieth century and how these have translated into very different policy approaches and outcomes. You'll learn about poverty and how it has changed, about how development ideas and processes connect to questions of gender, culture and race, about how processes such as migration, urbanisation and technological evolution intersect with development, and about the global governance of international development.You'll have the opportunity to build a range of professional skills, and will be trained in core research methods in order to undertake an individual piece of original research. Our placement-based dissertation option also enables you to gain valuable work experience.Optional modules from across the University are also available. These include subjects as diverse as food security, public health, urban development, and climate change.An optional international field class encourages you to engage with overseas development and community organisations through an intensive week of activities. We also offer a lower cost and more sustainable UK-based ‘hybrid’ field class as an alternative. International field class locations are subject to variation and subject to the number of students participating, but previous destinations have included Peru, Nepal and South Africa.The costs of optional field classes modules and placements are not included in your tuition fees. A limited amount of funding, accessed through a competitive process, is available to students to help finance field classes.Field class\n\n\nAn optional international field class encourages you to engage with overseas development and community organisations through an intensive week of activities.\nWe also offer a lower cost and more sustainable UK-based ‘hybrid’ field class as an alternative.\nInternational field class locations are subject to variation and subject to the number of students participating, but previous destinations have included Peru, Nepal and South Africa.\nThe costs of optional field classes modules and placements are not included in your tuition fees.

Students pursued research projects around themes of gender, health, migration, earthquake disaster recovery, community forestry and climate change. This research had a direct impact through a final dissemination event which in recent years involved national political and media attention as well as regional and local stakeholders.The field class is an amazing part of the masters programme, which allows you to consolidate the theory and ideas learnt in lectures, in the field. As well as preparing you for the dissertation it is also a great chance to meet and learn from students of different cultures in a new and interesting environment.HelenaTanzaniaThe Tanzania field class gave students practical experience of field research. Working with our NGO partner KEDA, students were based in rural communities around Mt Kilimanjaro.They researched a range of issues that affect local communities such as health, environmental change and poverty alleviation among smallholder farmers. Each year students fed back to district officials and previously had even been interviewed for National TV.The field class in Tanzania provided the incredible opportunity to bring case studies we had always read about in books and lectures to life through hands-on fieldwork. I was able to learn about issues in water, health and sanitation through the voices of local people. Conducting research in the rich and vibrant culture of Tanzania was an unforgettable experience.ShahreenEcuadorThe Ecuador field class gave students the opportunity to work closely with our local partner Intercultural Outreach Initiative, which is based on the Island Isabela in the Galapagos Islands. Our students gained experience in field research by exploring a range of issues that affect the local communities such as food security, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) issues and ocean plastic pollution. Each year students feed back to district officials and local stakeholders.You can read a blog from one of our students about a virtual field class.The virtual field class provided an opportunity to experience the challenges of international fieldwork, and allowed us to develop skills in adapting research to changing circumstances and using video interviews for data collection, which will be useful skills for the future! It was a great way to gain an understanding and insight into the situation around plastics in the Galapagos, despite not being able to visit!EllePlacement\n\n\nThe dissertation with placement gives you valuable practical experience of working in a development organisation and engaging with development issues.\nYou'll spend six to eight weeks in June or July based in a host organisation, where you'll carry out a research project identified by the organisation and approved by the University.

From May of the year of entry, formal programme regulations will be available in our Programme Regulations Finder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Autumn semester\n    \n\n      Spring semester\n    \n\n      Summer\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Core modules:\n\n\nIntroduction to Research Methods\n\n\nThis module is offered across several programmes. Learning activities for the module are tailored to your individual specialist areas to provide learning that is relevant and specific to your chosen degree programme.\n\n\n\nThis module provides students with an introduction to quantitative and qualitative research methods; it covers all stages of the research process from planning and design and research ethics and public and patient involvement, through to data collection and analysis and dissemination stages. It is specifically designed for students who do not have prior research experience and would be suitable for students from a range of backgrounds, but is particularly relevant to those interested in applied health related research. The course also provides a foundation for further learning in specific research methods.\n15 credits\n\n\nCritical Reflections in Global Health\n\n\nGlobal health has been described as the art and science of preventing disease, prolonging life, and promoting health through the organised efforts of society, with the goal being the attainment of biological, physical, and mental well-being of all members of society. In this module we take an inter-disciplinary approach to explore these themes.\n\nAligned with the themes of our key reader (7th edition of the Oxford Textbook of Global Public Health) we will consider some of the key concepts of global health, explore some of the determinants of health, and consider some of the key function / methods applied to address global health issues. We will then reflect on these themes in relation to the practice of global health through the lens of specific health challenges. Throughout the module themes such as inequalities in health, complexities in our response, and the political, social, and economic context within which we work will be repeatedly raised and discussed. \n\nIn delivering this module we are excited to have secured the expertise of regional, national, and international leaders and experts who will share their learnings on a diverse range of subjects that include socioeconomic and health inequalities, health intelligence, and sexual and reproductive health. In relation to the sharing of experiences and expertise, and in stimulating engaged discussion, throughout the module you will be encouraged to develop and use a reflective learning approach to consider shifts in your perception and understanding of the issues raised.\n15 credits\n\n\nIdeas and Practice in International Development\n\n\nThis module introduces students to key theoretical debates in international development. Co-taught by the Departments of Geography, Politics, Urban Studies and Planning, and Sociological Studies, it takes an interdisciplinary approach to exploring how thinking about development has changed over time, and why it has changed. The module also encourages students to think about the relationship between development theory and development practice.  It is spread over two semesters, in order to maximise the synergies between the core content of this module and the various other core and optional modules that students will take across the year.  The first semester focuses on the overarching questions of how development has been understood and conceptualised from the colonial period to the present. The changing development paradigms presented through weekly lectures are explored in depth through fortnightly seminars, each of which focuses on a set of key questions about changing theoretical perspectives and their implications for policy. The second semester then shifts focus onto a set of critical issues for policy and practice, including (for example) global health, migration, technology, urbanization and development finance.  The overall aim of the module is to build students' understanding of the origins of the idea of international development, changing debates about its meaning and purpose, and the implications of these for policy and practice.\n30 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Optional modules:\n\n\nTheory and Debates in Food Security and Food Justice\n\n\nFood Security and Food Justice are areas of increasing importance at local, national, transnational and global scales. Political and non-political agents at multiple scales have recognised that Global Hunger and Food Security (of which Food Justice is a primary component) is a key challenge requiring urgent interdisciplinary investigation and problem solving. There remains limited agreement as to how best to approach these issues. This module provides students with a background to the problems encompassed within the food security/food justice nexus by drawing on academic and policy debates that focus on both the macro as well as the micro impacts. By looking across food systems, the module also critically evaluates different strategies for mitigating the impacts of food insecurity and injustice.  In addition to academic, knowledge and critical thinking skills, the module will help students to develop the following attributes: Communication, Networking, Collaboration, Influencing, Inclusivity, Defining Purpose, and Growth Mindset.\n15 credits\n\n\nProfessional Skills for Development\n\n\nIn this module, which is taught across several departments drawing in a range of multi-disciplinary expertise, students gain a critically engaged understanding of professional practice in international development and develop a range of professional skills for future career paths.  Through the module students will learn to apply academic training to real-world situations, with a strong focus on employability-related skills.\n\n\n\nStudents will be taught about a set of key transferable and employability skills in keeping with the Sheffield Graduate Attributes before being given the option to choose between one of three specialist skill development tracks for hands-on group work.   The key transferable skills covered will include communications, project design and fundraising, policy analysis and consultancy work, ethics and cultural sensitivity.  Whichever of the specialist tracks they choose, students will work on a group-based project output and an individual written assessment.  While acquiring some specialist skills, all students will reflect on all key transferable skills offered in the first half of the module.\n15 credits\n\n\nThe Science of Environmental Change\n\n\nThis module gives students a critical understanding of the science behind historical and recent environmental change. The module covers the core debates in environmental change, the science behind these changes, methods for detecting environmental change, and the impacts of these changes, and projected future changes.\n15 credits\n\n\nEpidemiology\n\n\nEpidemiology is the discipline underpinning both effective public health practice and research into the causes, control and prevention of disease.  Knowledge and understanding of epidemiological concepts and methods is a basic requirement for effective public health practice. \n\nThis module will provide an introduction to epidemiology covering key epidemiological concepts; measures of disease; association and causation; confounding and bias.  It will also introduce research designs including cross-sectional, ecological, cohort, case-control and intervention studies and introduce population health measures such as screening.\n15 credits\n\n\nDisaster and Emergency Management\n\n\nDisasters and emergencies can strike any community.  It is not a question of whether a disaster will occur but when.  However, the likelihood, scale and impact of a disaster can be minimized through appropriate emergency planning, preparation and response by the community, governmental and non-governmental organisations.  This module will cover the key concepts of disaster and emergency management, explore some of the contemporary issues and develop students' knowledge and skills in this field.\n15 credits\n\n\nFoundations of GIS\n\n\nThis module introduces students to the core principles and skills of GIS. It covers the major sources of data used to study the lived environment and the variety of ways it can be displayed to aid both understanding and analysis. The module has a particular focus on techniques used in the analysis of socio-economic and demographic data and its potential applications. It is taught through a combination of lectures and practical workshops using ArcGIS software.\n15 credits\n\n\nThe Digital Self\n\n\nThis module explores how gender, age, race, class and other identities are being reimagined in what various commentators have called a 'social media age'. It provides students with an in-depth understanding of social media platforms, roles in people's identity negotiations, examining users' social media identities in different global contexts, and paying close attention to the intersections between different identities. It reviews debates about self and  identity formations from the earliest digital media moments and considers contemporary concerns, such as: anonymity and agency; selfies and influencers; online censorship, resistance and collective identities; social media fandoms; disconnection and digital detox\n15 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Optional modules:\n\n\nUK-Based Field Class\n\n\nThis optional, UK-based field class provides you with the opportunity to explore and engage with development issues through practical fieldwork experiences. Central to the module is a focus on developing critical reflectivity on the nature of development in a particular globalised and historicised context. You will have the opportunity to practise and build on research skills learnt in Semester 1 as well as dealing with issues of ethics, power and co-produced development research and practice. You will work in-person with UK partners or conduct remote or hybrid research with overseas partners, you will develop transferable skills through teamwork and engagement with a variety of stakeholders.\n\nFor field trips to run we require a minimum number of students to sign up for these modules. This varies depending on the specifics of individual field trips. If this number is not reached, the field trip will be cancelled. To assist with planning, this module must be selected by the end of the Semester One Add/Drop period.\n15 credits\n\n\nEnvironment, Society and Development: Key Issues, Debates and Concepts\n\n\nThis module engages critically with the key theoretical debates that shape the relationships between the environment, society and international development. By looking at current questions in development theory and their relationship to development practice in the context of the Anthropocene and environmental change, it encourages students to think critically about the ways in which interdisciplinary approaches define issues and problems, and the theoretical viewpoints that inform their actions. The module is taught primarily through seminars: these structure students' learning, and provide an environment in which they can develop their skills in researching, presenting and debating arguments drawn from the academic literature on international development.\n15 credits\n\n\nInternational Development Fieldclass\n\n\nThis optional field class module provides you with the opportunity to explore and engage with development issues through practical fieldwork experiences, and to enhance your understanding of grass-roots development organisations. \n\nCentral to the module is a focus on developing critical reflectivity on the nature of development in a particular globalised and historicised context. You will have the opportunity to practise and build on research skills learnt in Semester 1 as well as dealing with issues of ethics, power and co-produced development research and practice. \n\nYou will work with an International partner, and you will develop transferable skills through teamwork and engagement with a variety of stakeholders.\n\nFor field trips to run we require a minimum number of students to sign up for these modules. This varies depending on the specifics of individual field trips. If this number is not reached, the field trip will be cancelled. To assist with planning, this module must be selected by the end of the Semester One Add/Drop period.\n15 credits\n\n\nManaging Climate Change\n\n\nThis module aims to provide students with a strong understanding of the social and physical science of climate change with relevance to international development.  This understanding is then applied to consider the challenge of living with climate change in the Global South. The module is taught through seminars and lectures. Lectures introduce and impart factual knowledge while seminars allow discussion and an emphasis on applying key concepts to practical situations. Together these structure students' learning, and provide an environment in which they can develop their skills in researching, presenting and debating arguments drawn from the wide ranging literature on climate change.\n15 credits\n\n\nHealth Promotion\n\n\nHealth Promotion enables people to take control over and improve their own health.  It builds on knowledge from behavioural science that individual behaviour and health are determined by the social, physical and economic environment.  This module will consider the nature of health promotion from a global perspective, the associated ideological dilemmas, current understanding of individual and group behaviours, methods of promoting health and the evaluation of health promotion.  The module will use the 5 key principles within the Ottawa Charter applied to health promotion as a framework.  Case studies will be used to give students practical examples of health promotion in different countries.\n15 credits\n\n\nPublic Health Informatics\n\n\nPublic Health Informatics is a module designed to look at how informatics and information technology can be used to help address some of the major issues in public health. Public health informatics was traditionally defined as the systematic application of information and computer science and technology to public health practice, research, and learning (Yasnoff, 2000). In this module, we examine this rapidly changing field, using a combination of lectures, individual and group exercises and self directed learning. Key issues around the local, national and international contributions that technology can make to public health are critically examined and students are given a theoretical and practical grounding in this increasingly important discipline.\n15 credits\n\n\nCommunicable Disease Control\n\n\nHealth protection is one of the cornerstones of public health.  The control of communicable diseases is one of the major functions of health protection.  This module will cover the principles of surveillance, outbreak management, immunisation programmes, and prevention and control of infectious diseases.  It will also present a broad range of common infectious disease topics including HIV, tuberculosis, meningitis, diarrhoeal illnesses and hospital acquired infections.  This module would provide the essential foundations for students intending to undertake the Faculty of Public Health Part A/Diploma examination.\n15 credits\n\n\nUsing Policy to Strengthen Health Systems\n\n\nThe module seeks to build on students' own experiences and knowledge of policy and public health systems. During the module, you will work individually and also in groups to develop a critical understanding of policy within particular public health systems. You will consider how policy to strengthen public health systems is developed and how improvements might be targeted at any combination of the regional, national, district, and community levels.\n\nIn the module, policy is interpreted broadly as 'purposeful and deliberate actions' through which efforts can be made to reshape or address issues within public health systems and is about power and politics (cf. Gilson, 2012). Public health systems are understood both as public health systems (covering, for example, health protection, health promotion and health care public health) and, more narrowly, as health care systems. The module is suitable for students with a broad public health and health care knowledge, but also for those with more limited experience.\n15 credits\n\n\nCapitalism and Crisis\n\n\nDuring this module, you will explore the relationship between capitalism and crisis through the prism of the causes of, and fallout from, the 2008 crash.\n\nYou will unpack the core concepts of the module - capitalism and crisis - and gain a brief historical overview of pre-2008 economic crises to contextualise and compare the main content of the module. You shall then go on to survey competing explanations of the 2008 crisis, by starting narrow (i.e. regulation of banking) and then broadening out (i.e. evolution of capitalism).\n\nBy the end of the module, you will have examined the economic and political fallout of  the 2008 crisis, be able to debate the extent to which the crisis was truly global, and discuss the variety of political responses to the crash.\n30 credits\n\n\nCitizen Participation in Planning and Development\n\n\nRecent decades have seen a proliferation of initiatives to involve citizens in policy-making, planning and urban governance. There is widespread agreement that 'citizen engagement' can play a positive role in democratizing urban development. However, public participation raises a range of significant challenges for urban professional practice. This module will draw on critical debates about the roles citizens and publics can and should play in shaping the city to reflect on the theory and practice of participation. The module is taught through seminars which structure learning, and help students to research case studies of participatory initiatives.\n15 credits\n\n\nUrban Informality\n\n\nThe overall aim of this module is to critically examine informality, with a particular but not exclusive focus on cities of the Global South. The module relies on a mixture of lectures, seminars and student-led group work, with the latter focusing on an in-depth case study of a selected city. It explores patterns and causes of informality and discusses the strengths and limitations of a range of theoretical approaches. It also analyses the success of different real-world urban planning responses (understood in broad terms), including government-led, donor-led and community-focused ones, in addressing key urban issues in the context of informality.\n15 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Core modules - choose from:\n\n\nResearch Foundations with Placement\n\n\nThis module allows students to develop and manage an individual, interdisciplinary research project.  The module aims to help students to develop and apply research skills and an appreciation of the issues involved in managing a research project; to develop an understanding of the role of research in relation to theoretical and practical dimensions of the chosen discipline; and to further and deepen knowledge in their chosen area of international development. The module combines an independent research project with experience of working (in-person or virtually) with a development related organisation.  Students make a detailed analysis of an issue, topic or problem agreed with their host organisation, develop a research proposal, carry out research while on placement, and produce both a dissertation and a shorter consultancy-style report based on their dissertation findings. The module is supported by lectures, seminars, fieldwork and one-to-one supervision.  It includes core research methods required to undertake a dissertation at Masters level in the field of International Development, which are assessed through a 2,500-word research proposal in the Spring, and a final 10,000-word dissertation alongside the 2,500-word placement report at the end of Summer.\n60 credits\n\n\nResearch Foundations without Placement\n\n\nThis module allows students to develop and manage an individual, interdisciplinary research project.  The module aims to help students to develop and apply research skills and an appreciation of the issues involved in managing a research project; to develop an understanding of the role of research in relation to theoretical and practical dimensions of the chosen discipline; and to further and deepen knowledge in their chosen area of international development. The module involves a supervised research project carried out either independently or as an attachment to a wider UoS research project.  Students make a detailed analysis of an issue, topic or problem agreed with their dissertation supervisor, develop a research proposal, carry out research, and produce a dissertation.  In the case of students working with a UoS research project, they will also engage with the Research Lead (who will usually, but not always, be their supervisor). The module is supported by lectures, seminars, fieldwork and one-to-one supervision.  It includes core research methods required to undertake a dissertation at Masters level in the field of International Development, which are assessed through a 2,500-word research proposal in the Spring, and a final 12,500-word dissertation at the end of Summer.\n60 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content of our courses is reviewed annually to make sure it's up-to-date and relevant.

Working across the School of Geography and Planning and the School of Medicine and Population Health, you'll develop an understanding of the interventions necessary to improve the health of communities.The course is rooted in principles of interdisciplinary learning, decolonising knowledge, connecting theory with policy and practice. You'll also have the flexibility to tailor the course to you own interests.Through this approach it offers a unique combination of academic excellence, tailored professional skills teaching, an optional field class, and a research-based dissertation based on placements, research collaborations or independent research.Core modules will teach you about changing ideas of ‘development’ since the mid-twentieth century and how these have translated into very different policy approaches and outcomes. You'll learn about poverty and how it has changed, about how development ideas and processes connect to questions of gender, culture and race, about how processes such as migration, urbanisation and technological evolution intersect with development, and about the global governance of international development.You'll have the opportunity to build a range of professional skills, and will be trained in core research methods in order to undertake an individual piece of original research. Our placement-based dissertation option also enables you to gain valuable work experience.Optional modules from across the University are also available. These include subjects as diverse as food security, public health, urban development, and climate change.An optional international field class encourages you to engage with overseas development and community organisations through an intensive week of activities. We also offer a lower cost and more sustainable UK-based ‘hybrid’ field class as an alternative. International field class locations are subject to variation and subject to the number of students participating, but previous destinations have included Peru, Nepal and South Africa.The costs of optional field classes modules and placements are not included in your tuition fees. A limited amount of funding, accessed through a competitive process, is available to students to help finance field classes.Field class\n\n\nAn optional international field class encourages you to engage with overseas development and community organisations through an intensive week of activities.\nWe also offer a lower cost and more sustainable UK-based ‘hybrid’ field class as an alternative.\nInternational field class locations are subject to variation and subject to the number of students participating, but previous destinations have included Peru, Nepal and South Africa.\nThe costs of optional field classes modules and placements are not included in your tuition fees.

Students pursued research projects around themes of gender, health, migration, earthquake disaster recovery, community forestry and climate change. This research had a direct impact through a final dissemination event which in recent years involved national political and media attention as well as regional and local stakeholders.The field class is an amazing part of the masters programme, which allows you to consolidate the theory and ideas learnt in lectures, in the field. As well as preparing you for the dissertation it is also a great chance to meet and learn from students of different cultures in a new and interesting environment.HelenaTanzaniaThe Tanzania field class gave students practical experience of field research. Working with our NGO partner KEDA, students were based in rural communities around Mt Kilimanjaro.They researched a range of issues that affect local communities such as health, environmental change and poverty alleviation among smallholder farmers. Each year students fed back to district officials and previously had even been interviewed for National TV.The field class in Tanzania provided the incredible opportunity to bring case studies we had always read about in books and lectures to life through hands-on fieldwork. I was able to learn about issues in water, health and sanitation through the voices of local people. Conducting research in the rich and vibrant culture of Tanzania was an unforgettable experience.ShahreenEcuadorThe Ecuador field class gave students the opportunity to work closely with our local partner Intercultural Outreach Initiative, which is based on the Island Isabela in the Galapagos Islands. Our students gained experience in field research by exploring a range of issues that affect the local communities such as food security, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) issues and ocean plastic pollution. Each year students feed back to district officials and local stakeholders.You can read a blog from one of our students about a virtual field class.The virtual field class provided an opportunity to experience the challenges of international fieldwork, and allowed us to develop skills in adapting research to changing circumstances and using video interviews for data collection, which will be useful skills for the future! It was a great way to gain an understanding and insight into the situation around plastics in the Galapagos, despite not being able to visit!EllePlacement\n\n\nThe dissertation with placement gives you valuable practical experience of working in a development organisation and engaging with development issues.\nYou'll spend six to eight weeks in June or July based in a host organisation, where you'll carry out a research project identified by the organisation and approved by the University. Your project will have clear practical relevance and will generate findings that form the basis of your dissertation. Students may also spend time working directly on the organisation's core activities.\nWe currently work with over 30 host organisations in the UK and across the globe. Some have a wide remit, others have a specialist focus on issues such as conservation, education or health.\nPlacements to overseas destinations are subject to the same potential constraints imposed by travel conditions and health risks due to Covid-19.\nThe costs of the dissertation with placement module are not included in your tuition fees.

From May of the year of entry, formal programme regulations will be available in our Programme Regulations Finder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Autumn semester\n    \n\n      Spring semester\n    \n\n      Summer\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Core modules:\n\n\nIntroduction to Research Methods\n\n\nThis module is offered across several programmes. Learning activities for the module are tailored to your individual specialist areas to provide learning that is relevant and specific to your chosen degree programme.\n\n\n\nThis module provides students with an introduction to quantitative and qualitative research methods; it covers all stages of the research process from planning and design and research ethics and public and patient involvement, through to data collection and analysis and dissemination stages. It is specifically designed for students who do not have prior research experience and would be suitable for students from a range of backgrounds, but is particularly relevant to those interested in applied health related research. The course also provides a foundation for further learning in specific research methods.\n15 credits\n\n\nCritical Reflections in Global Health\n\n\nGlobal health has been described as the art and science of preventing disease, prolonging life, and promoting health through the organised efforts of society, with the goal being the attainment of biological, physical, and mental well-being of all members of society. In this module we take an inter-disciplinary approach to explore these themes.\n\nAligned with the themes of our key reader (7th edition of the Oxford Textbook of Global Public Health) we will consider some of the key concepts of global health, explore some of the determinants of health, and consider some of the key function / methods applied to address global health issues. We will then reflect on these themes in relation to the practice of global health through the lens of specific health challenges. Throughout the module themes such as inequalities in health, complexities in our response, and the political, social, and economic context within which we work will be repeatedly raised and discussed. \n\nIn delivering this module we are excited to have secured the expertise of regional, national, and international leaders and experts who will share their learnings on a diverse range of subjects that include socioeconomic and health inequalities, health intelligence, and sexual and reproductive health. In relation to the sharing of experiences and expertise, and in stimulating engaged discussion, throughout the module you will be encouraged to develop and use a reflective learning approach to consider shifts in your perception and understanding of the issues raised.\n15 credits\n\n\nIdeas and Practice in International Development\n\n\nThis module introduces students to key theoretical debates in international development. Co-taught by the Departments of Geography, Politics, Urban Studies and Planning, and Sociological Studies, it takes an interdisciplinary approach to exploring how thinking about development has changed over time, and why it has changed. The module also encourages students to think about the relationship between development theory and development practice.  It is spread over two semesters, in order to maximise the synergies between the core content of this module and the various other core and optional modules that students will take across the year.  The first semester focuses on the overarching questions of how development has been understood and conceptualised from the colonial period to the present. The changing development paradigms presented through weekly lectures are explored in depth through fortnightly seminars, each of which focuses on a set of key questions about changing theoretical perspectives and their implications for policy. The second semester then shifts focus onto a set of critical issues for policy and practice, including (for example) global health, migration, technology, urbanization and development finance.  The overall aim of the module is to build students' understanding of the origins of the idea of international development, changing debates about its meaning and purpose, and the implications of these for policy and practice.\n30 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Optional modules:\n\n\nTheory and Debates in Food Security and Food Justice\n\n\nFood Security and Food Justice are areas of increasing importance at local, national, transnational and global scales. Political and non-political agents at multiple scales have recognised that Global Hunger and Food Security (of which Food Justice is a primary component) is a key challenge requiring urgent interdisciplinary investigation and problem solving. There remains limited agreement as to how best to approach these issues. This module provides students with a background to the problems encompassed within the food security/food justice nexus by drawing on academic and policy debates that focus on both the macro as well as the micro impacts. By looking across food systems, the module also critically evaluates different strategies for mitigating the impacts of food insecurity and injustice.  In addition to academic, knowledge and critical thinking skills, the module will help students to develop the following attributes: Communication, Networking, Collaboration, Influencing, Inclusivity, Defining Purpose, and Growth Mindset.\n15 credits\n\n\nProfessional Skills for Development\n\n\nIn this module, which is taught across several departments drawing in a range of multi-disciplinary expertise, students gain a critically engaged understanding of professional practice in international development and develop a range of professional skills for future career paths.  Through the module students will learn to apply academic training to real-world situations, with a strong focus on employability-related skills.\n\n\n\nStudents will be taught about a set of key transferable and employability skills in keeping with the Sheffield Graduate Attributes before being given the option to choose between one of three specialist skill development tracks for hands-on group work.   The key transferable skills covered will include communications, project design and fundraising, policy analysis and consultancy work, ethics and cultural sensitivity.  Whichever of the specialist tracks they choose, students will work on a group-based project output and an individual written assessment.  While acquiring some specialist skills, all students will reflect on all key transferable skills offered in the first half of the module.\n15 credits\n\n\nThe Science of Environmental Change\n\n\nThis module gives students a critical understanding of the science behind historical and recent environmental change. The module covers the core debates in environmental change, the science behind these changes, methods for detecting environmental change, and the impacts of these changes, and projected future changes.\n15 credits\n\n\nEpidemiology\n\n\nEpidemiology is the discipline underpinning both effective public health practice and research into the causes, control and prevention of disease.  Knowledge and understanding of epidemiological concepts and methods is a basic requirement for effective public health practice. \n\nThis module will provide an introduction to epidemiology covering key epidemiological concepts; measures of disease; association and causation; confounding and bias.  It will also introduce research designs including cross-sectional, ecological, cohort, case-control and intervention studies and introduce population health measures such as screening.\n15 credits\n\n\nDisaster and Emergency Management\n\n\nDisasters and emergencies can strike any community.  It is not a question of whether a disaster will occur but when.  However, the likelihood, scale and impact of a disaster can be minimized through appropriate emergency planning, preparation and response by the community, governmental and non-governmental organisations.  This module will cover the key concepts of disaster and emergency management, explore some of the contemporary issues and develop students' knowledge and skills in this field.\n15 credits\n\n\nFoundations of GIS\n\n\nThis module introduces students to the core principles and skills of GIS. It covers the major sources of data used to study the lived environment and the variety of ways it can be displayed to aid both understanding and analysis. The module has a particular focus on techniques used in the analysis of socio-economic and demographic data and its potential applications. It is taught through a combination of lectures and practical workshops using ArcGIS software.\n15 credits\n\n\nThe Digital Self\n\n\nThis module explores how gender, age, race, class and other identities are being reimagined in what various commentators have called a 'social media age'. It provides students with an in-depth understanding of social media platforms, roles in people's identity negotiations, examining users' social media identities in different global contexts, and paying close attention to the intersections between different identities. It reviews debates about self and  identity formations from the earliest digital media moments and considers contemporary concerns, such as: anonymity and agency; selfies and influencers; online censorship, resistance and collective identities; social media fandoms; disconnection and digital detox\n15 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Optional modules:\n\n\nUK-Based Field Class\n\n\nThis optional, UK-based field class provides you with the opportunity to explore and engage with development issues through practical fieldwork experiences. Central to the module is a focus on developing critical reflectivity on the nature of development in a particular globalised and historicised context. You will have the opportunity to practise and build on research skills learnt in Semester 1 as well as dealing with issues of ethics, power and co-produced development research and practice. You will work in-person with UK partners or conduct remote or hybrid research with overseas partners, you will develop transferable skills through teamwork and engagement with a variety of stakeholders.\n\nFor field trips to run we require a minimum number of students to sign up for these modules. This varies depending on the specifics of individual field trips. If this number is not reached, the field trip will be cancelled. To assist with planning, this module must be selected by the end of the Semester One Add/Drop period.\n15 credits\n\n\nEnvironment, Society and Development: Key Issues, Debates and Concepts\n\n\nThis module engages critically with the key theoretical debates that shape the relationships between the environment, society and international development. By looking at current questions in development theory and their relationship to development practice in the context of the Anthropocene and environmental change, it encourages students to think critically about the ways in which interdisciplinary approaches define issues and problems, and the theoretical viewpoints that inform their actions. The module is taught primarily through seminars: these structure students' learning, and provide an environment in which they can develop their skills in researching, presenting and debating arguments drawn from the academic literature on international development.\n15 credits\n\n\nInternational Development Fieldclass\n\n\nThis optional field class module provides you with the opportunity to explore and engage with development issues through practical fieldwork experiences, and to enhance your understanding of grass-roots development organisations. \n\nCentral to the module is a focus on developing critical reflectivity on the nature of development in a particular globalised and historicised context. You will have the opportunity to practise and build on research skills learnt in Semester 1 as well as dealing with issues of ethics, power and co-produced development research and practice. \n\nYou will work with an International partner, and you will develop transferable skills through teamwork and engagement with a variety of stakeholders.\n\nFor field trips to run we require a minimum number of students to sign up for these modules. This varies depending on the specifics of individual field trips. If this number is not reached, the field trip will be cancelled. To assist with planning, this module must be selected by the end of the Semester One Add/Drop period.\n15 credits\n\n\nManaging Climate Change\n\n\nThis module aims to provide students with a strong understanding of the social and physical science of climate change with relevance to international development.  This understanding is then applied to consider the challenge of living with climate change in the Global South. The module is taught through seminars and lectures. Lectures introduce and impart factual knowledge while seminars allow discussion and an emphasis on applying key concepts to practical situations. Together these structure students' learning, and provide an environment in which they can develop their skills in researching, presenting and debating arguments drawn from the wide ranging literature on climate change.\n15 credits\n\n\nHealth Promotion\n\n\nHealth Promotion enables people to take control over and improve their own health.  It builds on knowledge from behavioural science that individual behaviour and health are determined by the social, physical and economic environment.  This module will consider the nature of health promotion from a global perspective, the associated ideological dilemmas, current understanding of individual and group behaviours, methods of promoting health and the evaluation of health promotion.  The module will use the 5 key principles within the Ottawa Charter applied to health promotion as a framework.  Case studies will be used to give students practical examples of health promotion in different countries.\n15 credits\n\n\nPublic Health Informatics\n\n\nPublic Health Informatics is a module designed to look at how informatics and information technology can be used to help address some of the major issues in public health. Public health informatics was traditionally defined as the systematic application of information and computer science and technology to public health practice, research, and learning (Yasnoff, 2000). In this module, we examine this rapidly changing field, using a combination of lectures, individual and group exercises and self directed learning. Key issues around the local, national and international contributions that technology can make to public health are critically examined and students are given a theoretical and practical grounding in this increasingly important discipline.\n15 credits\n\n\nCommunicable Disease Control\n\n\nHealth protection is one of the cornerstones of public health.  The control of communicable diseases is one of the major functions of health protection.  This module will cover the principles of surveillance, outbreak management, immunisation programmes, and prevention and control of infectious diseases.  It will also present a broad range of common infectious disease topics including HIV, tuberculosis, meningitis, diarrhoeal illnesses and hospital acquired infections.  This module would provide the essential foundations for students intending to undertake the Faculty of Public Health Part A/Diploma examination.\n15 credits\n\n\nUsing Policy to Strengthen Health Systems\n\n\nThe module seeks to build on students' own experiences and knowledge of policy and public health systems. During the module, you will work individually and also in groups to develop a critical understanding of policy within particular public health systems. You will consider how policy to strengthen public health systems is developed and how improvements might be targeted at any combination of the regional, national, district, and community levels.\n\nIn the module, policy is interpreted broadly as 'purposeful and deliberate actions' through which efforts can be made to reshape or address issues within public health systems and is about power and politics (cf. Gilson, 2012). Public health systems are understood both as public health systems (covering, for example, health protection, health promotion and health care public health) and, more narrowly, as health care systems. The module is suitable for students with a broad public health and health care knowledge, but also for those with more limited experience.\n15 credits\n\n\nCapitalism and Crisis\n\n\nDuring this module, you will explore the relationship between capitalism and crisis through the prism of the causes of, and fallout from, the 2008 crash.\n\nYou will unpack the core concepts of the module - capitalism and crisis - and gain a brief historical overview of pre-2008 economic crises to contextualise and compare the main content of the module. You shall then go on to survey competing explanations of the 2008 crisis, by starting narrow (i.e. regulation of banking) and then broadening out (i.e. evolution of capitalism).\n\nBy the end of the module, you will have examined the economic and political fallout of  the 2008 crisis, be able to debate the extent to which the crisis was truly global, and discuss the variety of political responses to the crash.\n30 credits\n\n\nCitizen Participation in Planning and Development\n\n\nRecent decades have seen a proliferation of initiatives to involve citizens in policy-making, planning and urban governance. There is widespread agreement that 'citizen engagement' can play a positive role in democratizing urban development. However, public participation raises a range of significant challenges for urban professional practice. This module will draw on critical debates about the roles citizens and publics can and should play in shaping the city to reflect on the theory and practice of participation. The module is taught through seminars which structure learning, and help students to research case studies of participatory initiatives.\n15 credits\n\n\nUrban Informality\n\n\nThe overall aim of this module is to critically examine informality, with a particular but not exclusive focus on cities of the Global South. The module relies on a mixture of lectures, seminars and student-led group work, with the latter focusing on an in-depth case study of a selected city. It explores patterns and causes of informality and discusses the strengths and limitations of a range of theoretical approaches. It also analyses the success of different real-world urban planning responses (understood in broad terms), including government-led, donor-led and community-focused ones, in addressing key urban issues in the context of informality.\n15 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Core modules - choose from:\n\n\nResearch Foundations with Placement\n\n\nThis module allows students to develop and manage an individual, interdisciplinary research project.  The module aims to help students to develop and apply research skills and an appreciation of the issues involved in managing a research project; to develop an understanding of the role of research in relation to theoretical and practical dimensions of the chosen discipline; and to further and deepen knowledge in their chosen area of international development. The module combines an independent research project with experience of working (in-person or virtually) with a development related organisation.  Students make a detailed analysis of an issue, topic or problem agreed with their host organisation, develop a research proposal, carry out research while on placement, and produce both a dissertation and a shorter consultancy-style report based on their dissertation findings. The module is supported by lectures, seminars, fieldwork and one-to-one supervision.  It includes core research methods required to undertake a dissertation at Masters level in the field of International Development, which are assessed through a 2,500-word research proposal in the Spring, and a final 10,000-word dissertation alongside the 2,500-word placement report at the end of Summer.\n60 credits\n\n\nResearch Foundations without Placement\n\n\nThis module allows students to develop and manage an individual, interdisciplinary research project.  The module aims to help students to develop and apply research skills and an appreciation of the issues involved in managing a research project; to develop an understanding of the role of research in relation to theoretical and practical dimensions of the chosen discipline; and to further and deepen knowledge in their chosen area of international development. The module involves a supervised research project carried out either independently or as an attachment to a wider UoS research project.  Students make a detailed analysis of an issue, topic or problem agreed with their dissertation supervisor, develop a research proposal, carry out research, and produce a dissertation.  In the case of students working with a UoS research project, they will also engage with the Research Lead (who will usually, but not always, be their supervisor). The module is supported by lectures, seminars, fieldwork and one-to-one supervision.  It includes core research methods required to undertake a dissertation at Masters level in the field of International Development, which are assessed through a 2,500-word research proposal in the Spring, and a final 12,500-word dissertation at the end of Summer.\n60 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content of our courses is reviewed annually to make sure it's up-to-date and relevant.

From May of the year of entry, formal programme regulations will be available in our Programme Regulations Finder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Autumn semester\n    \n\n      Spring semester\n    \n\n      Summer\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Core modules:\n\n\nIntroduction to Research Methods\n\n\nThis module is offered across several programmes. Learning activities for the module are tailored to your individual specialist areas to provide learning that is relevant and specific to your chosen degree programme.\n\n\n\nThis module provides students with an introduction to quantitative and qualitative research methods; it covers all stages of the research process from planning and design and research ethics and public and patient involvement, through to data collection and analysis and dissemination stages. It is specifically designed for students who do not have prior research experience and would be suitable for students from a range of backgrounds, but is particularly relevant to those interested in applied health related research. The course also provides a foundation for further learning in specific research methods.\n15 credits\n\n\nCritical Reflections in Global Health\n\n\nGlobal health has been described as the art and science of preventing disease, prolonging life, and promoting health through the organised efforts of society, with the goal being the attainment of biological, physical, and mental well-being of all members of society. In this module we take an inter-disciplinary approach to explore these themes.\n\nAligned with the themes of our key reader (7th edition of the Oxford Textbook of Global Public Health) we will consider some of the key concepts of global health, explore some of the determinants of health, and consider some of the key function / methods applied to address global health issues. We will then reflect on these themes in relation to the practice of global health through the lens of specific health challenges. Throughout the module themes such as inequalities in health, complexities in our response, and the political, social, and economic context within which we work will be repeatedly raised and discussed. \n\nIn delivering this module we are excited to have secured the expertise of regional, national, and international leaders and experts who will share their learnings on a diverse range of subjects that include socioeconomic and health inequalities, health intelligence, and sexual and reproductive health. In relation to the sharing of experiences and expertise, and in stimulating engaged discussion, throughout the module you will be encouraged to develop and use a reflective learning approach to consider shifts in your perception and understanding of the issues raised.\n15 credits\n\n\nIdeas and Practice in International Development\n\n\nThis module introduces students to key theoretical debates in international development. Co-taught by the Departments of Geography, Politics, Urban Studies and Planning, and Sociological Studies, it takes an interdisciplinary approach to exploring how thinking about development has changed over time, and why it has changed. The module also encourages students to think about the relationship between development theory and development practice.  It is spread over two semesters, in order to maximise the synergies between the core content of this module and the various other core and optional modules that students will take across the year.  The first semester focuses on the overarching questions of how development has been understood and conceptualised from the colonial period to the present. The changing development paradigms presented through weekly lectures are explored in depth through fortnightly seminars, each of which focuses on a set of key questions about changing theoretical perspectives and their implications for policy. The second semester then shifts focus onto a set of critical issues for policy and practice, including (for example) global health, migration, technology, urbanization and development finance.  The overall aim of the module is to build students' understanding of the origins of the idea of international development, changing debates about its meaning and purpose, and the implications of these for policy and practice.\n30 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Optional modules:\n\n\nTheory and Debates in Food Security and Food Justice\n\n\nFood Security and Food Justice are areas of increasing importance at local, national, transnational and global scales. Political and non-political agents at multiple scales have recognised that Global Hunger and Food Security (of which Food Justice is a primary component) is a key challenge requiring urgent interdisciplinary investigation and problem solving. There remains limited agreement as to how best to approach these issues. This module provides students with a background to the problems encompassed within the food security/food justice nexus by drawing on academic and policy debates that focus on both the macro as well as the micro impacts. By looking across food systems, the module also critically evaluates different strategies for mitigating the impacts of food insecurity and injustice.  In addition to academic, knowledge and critical thinking skills, the module will help students to develop the following attributes: Communication, Networking, Collaboration, Influencing, Inclusivity, Defining Purpose, and Growth Mindset.\n15 credits\n\n\nProfessional Skills for Development\n\n\nIn this module, which is taught across several departments drawing in a range of multi-disciplinary expertise, students gain a critically engaged understanding of professional practice in international development and develop a range of professional skills for future career paths.  Through the module students will learn to apply academic training to real-world situations, with a strong focus on employability-related skills.\n\n\n\nStudents will be taught about a set of key transferable and employability skills in keeping with the Sheffield Graduate Attributes before being given the option to choose between one of three specialist skill development tracks for hands-on group work.   The key transferable skills covered will include communications, project design and fundraising, policy analysis and consultancy work, ethics and cultural sensitivity.  Whichever of the specialist tracks they choose, students will work on a group-based project output and an individual written assessment.  While acquiring some specialist skills, all students will reflect on all key transferable skills offered in the first half of the module.\n15 credits\n\n\nThe Science of Environmental Change\n\n\nThis module gives students a critical understanding of the science behind historical and recent environmental change. The module covers the core debates in environmental change, the science behind these changes, methods for detecting environmental change, and the impacts of these changes, and projected future changes.\n15 credits\n\n\nEpidemiology\n\n\nEpidemiology is the discipline underpinning both effective public health practice and research into the causes, control and prevention of disease.  Knowledge and understanding of epidemiological concepts and methods is a basic requirement for effective public health practice. \n\nThis module will provide an introduction to epidemiology covering key epidemiological concepts; measures of disease; association and causation; confounding and bias.  It will also introduce research designs including cross-sectional, ecological, cohort, case-control and intervention studies and introduce population health measures such as screening.\n15 credits\n\n\nDisaster and Emergency Management\n\n\nDisasters and emergencies can strike any community.  It is not a question of whether a disaster will occur but when.  However, the likelihood, scale and impact of a disaster can be minimized through appropriate emergency planning, preparation and response by the community, governmental and non-governmental organisations.  This module will cover the key concepts of disaster and emergency management, explore some of the contemporary issues and develop students' knowledge and skills in this field.\n15 credits\n\n\nFoundations of GIS\n\n\nThis module introduces students to the core principles and skills of GIS. It covers the major sources of data used to study the lived environment and the variety of ways it can be displayed to aid both understanding and analysis. The module has a particular focus on techniques used in the analysis of socio-economic and demographic data and its potential applications. It is taught through a combination of lectures and practical workshops using ArcGIS software.\n15 credits\n\n\nThe Digital Self\n\n\nThis module explores how gender, age, race, class and other identities are being reimagined in what various commentators have called a 'social media age'. It provides students with an in-depth understanding of social media platforms, roles in people's identity negotiations, examining users' social media identities in different global contexts, and paying close attention to the intersections between different identities. It reviews debates about self and  identity formations from the earliest digital media moments and considers contemporary concerns, such as: anonymity and agency; selfies and influencers; online censorship, resistance and collective identities; social media fandoms; disconnection and digital detox\n15 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Optional modules:\n\n\nUK-Based Field Class\n\n\nThis optional, UK-based field class provides you with the opportunity to explore and engage with development issues through practical fieldwork experiences. Central to the module is a focus on developing critical reflectivity on the nature of development in a particular globalised and historicised context. You will have the opportunity to practise and build on research skills learnt in Semester 1 as well as dealing with issues of ethics, power and co-produced development research and practice. You will work in-person with UK partners or conduct remote or hybrid research with overseas partners, you will develop transferable skills through teamwork and engagement with a variety of stakeholders.\n\nFor field trips to run we require a minimum number of students to sign up for these modules. This varies depending on the specifics of individual field trips. If this number is not reached, the field trip will be cancelled. To assist with planning, this module must be selected by the end of the Semester One Add/Drop period.\n15 credits\n\n\nEnvironment, Society and Development: Key Issues, Debates and Concepts\n\n\nThis module engages critically with the key theoretical debates that shape the relationships between the environment, society and international development. By looking at current questions in development theory and their relationship to development practice in the context of the Anthropocene and environmental change, it encourages students to think critically about the ways in which interdisciplinary approaches define issues and problems, and the theoretical viewpoints that inform their actions. The module is taught primarily through seminars: these structure students' learning, and provide an environment in which they can develop their skills in researching, presenting and debating arguments drawn from the academic literature on international development.\n15 credits\n\n\nInternational Development Fieldclass\n\n\nThis optional field class module provides you with the opportunity to explore and engage with development issues through practical fieldwork experiences, and to enhance your understanding of grass-roots development organisations. \n\nCentral to the module is a focus on developing critical reflectivity on the nature of development in a particular globalised and historicised context. You will have the opportunity to practise and build on research skills learnt in Semester 1 as well as dealing with issues of ethics, power and co-produced development research and practice. \n\nYou will work with an International partner, and you will develop transferable skills through teamwork and engagement with a variety of stakeholders.\n\nFor field trips to run we require a minimum number of students to sign up for these modules. This varies depending on the specifics of individual field trips. If this number is not reached, the field trip will be cancelled. To assist with planning, this module must be selected by the end of the Semester One Add/Drop period.\n15 credits\n\n\nManaging Climate Change\n\n\nThis module aims to provide students with a strong understanding of the social and physical science of climate change with relevance to international development.  This understanding is then applied to consider the challenge of living with climate change in the Global South. The module is taught through seminars and lectures. Lectures introduce and impart factual knowledge while seminars allow discussion and an emphasis on applying key concepts to practical situations. Together these structure students' learning, and provide an environment in which they can develop their skills in researching, presenting and debating arguments drawn from the wide ranging literature on climate change.\n15 credits\n\n\nHealth Promotion\n\n\nHealth Promotion enables people to take control over and improve their own health.  It builds on knowledge from behavioural science that individual behaviour and health are determined by the social, physical and economic environment.  This module will consider the nature of health promotion from a global perspective, the associated ideological dilemmas, current understanding of individual and group behaviours, methods of promoting health and the evaluation of health promotion.  The module will use the 5 key principles within the Ottawa Charter applied to health promotion as a framework.  Case studies will be used to give students practical examples of health promotion in different countries.\n15 credits\n\n\nPublic Health Informatics\n\n\nPublic Health Informatics is a module designed to look at how informatics and information technology can be used to help address some of the major issues in public health. Public health informatics was traditionally defined as the systematic application of information and computer science and technology to public health practice, research, and learning (Yasnoff, 2000). In this module, we examine this rapidly changing field, using a combination of lectures, individual and group exercises and self directed learning. Key issues around the local, national and international contributions that technology can make to public health are critically examined and students are given a theoretical and practical grounding in this increasingly important discipline.\n15 credits\n\n\nCommunicable Disease Control\n\n\nHealth protection is one of the cornerstones of public health.  The control of communicable diseases is one of the major functions of health protection.  This module will cover the principles of surveillance, outbreak management, immunisation programmes, and prevention and control of infectious diseases.  It will also present a broad range of common infectious disease topics including HIV, tuberculosis, meningitis, diarrhoeal illnesses and hospital acquired infections.  This module would provide the essential foundations for students intending to undertake the Faculty of Public Health Part A/Diploma examination.\n15 credits\n\n\nUsing Policy to Strengthen Health Systems\n\n\nThe module seeks to build on students' own experiences and knowledge of policy and public health systems. During the module, you will work individually and also in groups to develop a critical understanding of policy within particular public health systems. You will consider how policy to strengthen public health systems is developed and how improvements might be targeted at any combination of the regional, national, district, and community levels.\n\nIn the module, policy is interpreted broadly as 'purposeful and deliberate actions' through which efforts can be made to reshape or address issues within public health systems and is about power and politics (cf. Gilson, 2012). Public health systems are understood both as public health systems (covering, for example, health protection, health promotion and health care public health) and, more narrowly, as health care systems. The module is suitable for students with a broad public health and health care knowledge, but also for those with more limited experience.\n15 credits\n\n\nCapitalism and Crisis\n\n\nDuring this module, you will explore the relationship between capitalism and crisis through the prism of the causes of, and fallout from, the 2008 crash.\n\nYou will unpack the core concepts of the module - capitalism and crisis - and gain a brief historical overview of pre-2008 economic crises to contextualise and compare the main content of the module. You shall then go on to survey competing explanations of the 2008 crisis, by starting narrow (i.e. regulation of banking) and then broadening out (i.e. evolution of capitalism).\n\nBy the end of the module, you will have examined the economic and political fallout of  the 2008 crisis, be able to debate the extent to which the crisis was truly global, and discuss the variety of political responses to the crash.\n30 credits\n\n\nCitizen Participation in Planning and Development\n\n\nRecent decades have seen a proliferation of initiatives to involve citizens in policy-making, planning and urban governance. There is widespread agreement that 'citizen engagement' can play a positive role in democratizing urban development. However, public participation raises a range of significant challenges for urban professional practice. This module will draw on critical debates about the roles citizens and publics can and should play in shaping the city to reflect on the theory and practice of participation. The module is taught through seminars which structure learning, and help students to research case studies of participatory initiatives.\n15 credits\n\n\nUrban Informality\n\n\nThe overall aim of this module is to critically examine informality, with a particular but not exclusive focus on cities of the Global South. The module relies on a mixture of lectures, seminars and student-led group work, with the latter focusing on an in-depth case study of a selected city. It explores patterns and causes of informality and discusses the strengths and limitations of a range of theoretical approaches. It also analyses the success of different real-world urban planning responses (understood in broad terms), including government-led, donor-led and community-focused ones, in addressing key urban issues in the context of informality.\n15 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Core modules - choose from:\n\n\nResearch Foundations with Placement\n\n\nThis module allows students to develop and manage an individual, interdisciplinary research project.  The module aims to help students to develop and apply research skills and an appreciation of the issues involved in managing a research project; to develop an understanding of the role of research in relation to theoretical and practical dimensions of the chosen discipline; and to further and deepen knowledge in their chosen area of international development. The module combines an independent research project with experience of working (in-person or virtually) with a development related organisation.  Students make a detailed analysis of an issue, topic or problem agreed with their host organisation, develop a research proposal, carry out research while on placement, and produce both a dissertation and a shorter consultancy-style report based on their dissertation findings. The module is supported by lectures, seminars, fieldwork and one-to-one supervision.  It includes core research methods required to undertake a dissertation at Masters level in the field of International Development, which are assessed through a 2,500-word research proposal in the Spring, and a final 10,000-word dissertation alongside the 2,500-word placement report at the end of Summer.\n60 credits\n\n\nResearch Foundations without Placement\n\n\nThis module allows students to develop and manage an individual, interdisciplinary research project.  The module aims to help students to develop and apply research skills and an appreciation of the issues involved in managing a research project; to develop an understanding of the role of research in relation to theoretical and practical dimensions of the chosen discipline; and to further and deepen knowledge in their chosen area of international development. The module involves a supervised research project carried out either independently or as an attachment to a wider UoS research project.  Students make a detailed analysis of an issue, topic or problem agreed with their dissertation supervisor, develop a research proposal, carry out research, and produce a dissertation.  In the case of students working with a UoS research project, they will also engage with the Research Lead (who will usually, but not always, be their supervisor). The module is supported by lectures, seminars, fieldwork and one-to-one supervision.  It includes core research methods required to undertake a dissertation at Masters level in the field of International Development, which are assessed through a 2,500-word research proposal in the Spring, and a final 12,500-word dissertation at the end of Summer.\n60 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content of our courses is reviewed annually to make sure it's up-to-date and relevant.

From May of the year of entry, formal programme regulations will be available in our Programme Regulations Finder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Autumn semester\n    \n\n      Spring semester\n    \n\n      Summer\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Core modules:\n\n\nIntroduction to Research Methods\n\n\nThis module is offered across several programmes. Learning activities for the module are tailored to your individual specialist areas to provide learning that is relevant and specific to your chosen degree programme.\n\n\n\nThis module provides students with an introduction to quantitative and qualitative research methods; it covers all stages of the research process from planning and design and research ethics and public and patient involvement, through to data collection and analysis and dissemination stages. It is specifically designed for students who do not have prior research experience and would be suitable for students from a range of backgrounds, but is particularly relevant to those interested in applied health related research. The course also provides a foundation for further learning in specific research methods.\n15 credits\n\n\nCritical Reflections in Global Health\n\n\nGlobal health has been described as the art and science of preventing disease, prolonging life, and promoting health through the organised efforts of society, with the goal being the attainment of biological, physical, and mental well-being of all members of society. In this module we take an inter-disciplinary approach to explore these themes.\n\nAligned with the themes of our key reader (7th edition of the Oxford Textbook of Global Public Health) we will consider some of the key concepts of global health, explore some of the determinants of health, and consider some of the key function / methods applied to address global health issues. We will then reflect on these themes in relation to the practice of global health through the lens of specific health challenges. Throughout the module themes such as inequalities in health, complexities in our response, and the political, social, and economic context within which we work will be repeatedly raised and discussed. \n\nIn delivering this module we are excited to have secured the expertise of regional, national, and international leaders and experts who will share their learnings on a diverse range of subjects that include socioeconomic and health inequalities, health intelligence, and sexual and reproductive health. In relation to the sharing of experiences and expertise, and in stimulating engaged discussion, throughout the module you will be encouraged to develop and use a reflective learning approach to consider shifts in your perception and understanding of the issues raised.\n15 credits\n\n\nIdeas and Practice in International Development\n\n\nThis module introduces students to key theoretical debates in international development. Co-taught by the Departments of Geography, Politics, Urban Studies and Planning, and Sociological Studies, it takes an interdisciplinary approach to exploring how thinking about development has changed over time, and why it has changed. The module also encourages students to think about the relationship between development theory and development practice.  It is spread over two semesters, in order to maximise the synergies between the core content of this module and the various other core and optional modules that students will take across the year.  The first semester focuses on the overarching questions of how development has been understood and conceptualised from the colonial period to the present. The changing development paradigms presented through weekly lectures are explored in depth through fortnightly seminars, each of which focuses on a set of key questions about changing theoretical perspectives and their implications for policy. The second semester then shifts focus onto a set of critical issues for policy and practice, including (for example) global health, migration, technology, urbanization and development finance.  The overall aim of the module is to build students' understanding of the origins of the idea of international development, changing debates about its meaning and purpose, and the implications of these for policy and practice.\n30 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Optional modules:\n\n\nTheory and Debates in Food Security and Food Justice\n\n\nFood Security and Food Justice are areas of increasing importance at local, national, transnational and global scales. Political and non-political agents at multiple scales have recognised that Global Hunger and Food Security (of which Food Justice is a primary component) is a key challenge requiring urgent interdisciplinary investigation and problem solving. There remains limited agreement as to how best to approach these issues. This module provides students with a background to the problems encompassed within the food security/food justice nexus by drawing on academic and policy debates that focus on both the macro as well as the micro impacts. By looking across food systems, the module also critically evaluates different strategies for mitigating the impacts of food insecurity and injustice.  In addition to academic, knowledge and critical thinking skills, the module will help students to develop the following attributes: Communication, Networking, Collaboration, Influencing, Inclusivity, Defining Purpose, and Growth Mindset.\n15 credits\n\n\nProfessional Skills for Development\n\n\nIn this module, which is taught across several departments drawing in a range of multi-disciplinary expertise, students gain a critically engaged understanding of professional practice in international development and develop a range of professional skills for future career paths.  Through the module students will learn to apply academic training to real-world situations, with a strong focus on employability-related skills.\n\n\n\nStudents will be taught about a set of key transferable and employability skills in keeping with the Sheffield Graduate Attributes before being given the option to choose between one of three specialist skill development tracks for hands-on group work.   The key transferable skills covered will include communications, project design and fundraising, policy analysis and consultancy work, ethics and cultural sensitivity.  Whichever of the specialist tracks they choose, students will work on a group-based project output and an individual written assessment.  While acquiring some specialist skills, all students will reflect on all key transferable skills offered in the first half of the module.\n15 credits\n\n\nThe Science of Environmental Change\n\n\nThis module gives students a critical understanding of the science behind historical and recent environmental change. The module covers the core debates in environmental change, the science behind these changes, methods for detecting environmental change, and the impacts of these changes, and projected future changes.\n15 credits\n\n\nEpidemiology\n\n\nEpidemiology is the discipline underpinning both effective public health practice and research into the causes, control and prevention of disease.  Knowledge and understanding of epidemiological concepts and methods is a basic requirement for effective public health practice. \n\nThis module will provide an introduction to epidemiology covering key epidemiological concepts; measures of disease; association and causation; confounding and bias.  It will also introduce research designs including cross-sectional, ecological, cohort, case-control and intervention studies and introduce population health measures such as screening.\n15 credits\n\n\nDisaster and Emergency Management\n\n\nDisasters and emergencies can strike any community.  It is not a question of whether a disaster will occur but when.  However, the likelihood, scale and impact of a disaster can be minimized through appropriate emergency planning, preparation and response by the community, governmental and non-governmental organisations.  This module will cover the key concepts of disaster and emergency management, explore some of the contemporary issues and develop students' knowledge and skills in this field.\n15 credits\n\n\nFoundations of GIS\n\n\nThis module introduces students to the core principles and skills of GIS. It covers the major sources of data used to study the lived environment and the variety of ways it can be displayed to aid both understanding and analysis. The module has a particular focus on techniques used in the analysis of socio-economic and demographic data and its potential applications. It is taught through a combination of lectures and practical workshops using ArcGIS software.\n15 credits\n\n\nThe Digital Self\n\n\nThis module explores how gender, age, race, class and other identities are being reimagined in what various commentators have called a 'social media age'. It provides students with an in-depth understanding of social media platforms, roles in people's identity negotiations, examining users' social media identities in different global contexts, and paying close attention to the intersections between different identities. It reviews debates about self and  identity formations from the earliest digital media moments and considers contemporary concerns, such as: anonymity and agency; selfies and influencers; online censorship, resistance and collective identities; social media fandoms; disconnection and digital detox\n15 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Optional modules:\n\n\nUK-Based Field Class\n\n\nThis optional, UK-based field class provides you with the opportunity to explore and engage with development issues through practical fieldwork experiences. Central to the module is a focus on developing critical reflectivity on the nature of development in a particular globalised and historicised context. You will have the opportunity to practise and build on research skills learnt in Semester 1 as well as dealing with issues of ethics, power and co-produced development research and practice. You will work in-person with UK partners or conduct remote or hybrid research with overseas partners, you will develop transferable skills through teamwork and engagement with a variety of stakeholders.\n\nFor field trips to run we require a minimum number of students to sign up for these modules. This varies depending on the specifics of individual field trips. If this number is not reached, the field trip will be cancelled. To assist with planning, this module must be selected by the end of the Semester One Add/Drop period.\n15 credits\n\n\nEnvironment, Society and Development: Key Issues, Debates and Concepts\n\n\nThis module engages critically with the key theoretical debates that shape the relationships between the environment, society and international development. By looking at current questions in development theory and their relationship to development practice in the context of the Anthropocene and environmental change, it encourages students to think critically about the ways in which interdisciplinary approaches define issues and problems, and the theoretical viewpoints that inform their actions. The module is taught primarily through seminars: these structure students' learning, and provide an environment in which they can develop their skills in researching, presenting and debating arguments drawn from the academic literature on international development.\n15 credits\n\n\nInternational Development Fieldclass\n\n\nThis optional field class module provides you with the opportunity to explore and engage with development issues through practical fieldwork experiences, and to enhance your understanding of grass-roots development organisations. \n\nCentral to the module is a focus on developing critical reflectivity on the nature of development in a particular globalised and historicised context. You will have the opportunity to practise and build on research skills learnt in Semester 1 as well as dealing with issues of ethics, power and co-produced development research and practice. \n\nYou will work with an International partner, and you will develop transferable skills through teamwork and engagement with a variety of stakeholders.\n\nFor field trips to run we require a minimum number of students to sign up for these modules. This varies depending on the specifics of individual field trips. If this number is not reached, the field trip will be cancelled. To assist with planning, this module must be selected by the end of the Semester One Add/Drop period.\n15 credits\n\n\nManaging Climate Change\n\n\nThis module aims to provide students with a strong understanding of the social and physical science of climate change with relevance to international development.  This understanding is then applied to consider the challenge of living with climate change in the Global South. The module is taught through seminars and lectures. Lectures introduce and impart factual knowledge while seminars allow discussion and an emphasis on applying key concepts to practical situations. Together these structure students' learning, and provide an environment in which they can develop their skills in researching, presenting and debating arguments drawn from the wide ranging literature on climate change.\n15 credits\n\n\nHealth Promotion\n\n\nHealth Promotion enables people to take control over and improve their own health.  It builds on knowledge from behavioural science that individual behaviour and health are determined by the social, physical and economic environment.  This module will consider the nature of health promotion from a global perspective, the associated ideological dilemmas, current understanding of individual and group behaviours, methods of promoting health and the evaluation of health promotion.  The module will use the 5 key principles within the Ottawa Charter applied to health promotion as a framework.  Case studies will be used to give students practical examples of health promotion in different countries.\n15 credits\n\n\nPublic Health Informatics\n\n\nPublic Health Informatics is a module designed to look at how informatics and information technology can be used to help address some of the major issues in public health. Public health informatics was traditionally defined as the systematic application of information and computer science and technology to public health practice, research, and learning (Yasnoff, 2000). In this module, we examine this rapidly changing field, using a combination of lectures, individual and group exercises and self directed learning. Key issues around the local, national and international contributions that technology can make to public health are critically examined and students are given a theoretical and practical grounding in this increasingly important discipline.\n15 credits\n\n\nCommunicable Disease Control\n\n\nHealth protection is one of the cornerstones of public health.  The control of communicable diseases is one of the major functions of health protection.  This module will cover the principles of surveillance, outbreak management, immunisation programmes, and prevention and control of infectious diseases.  It will also present a broad range of common infectious disease topics including HIV, tuberculosis, meningitis, diarrhoeal illnesses and hospital acquired infections.  This module would provide the essential foundations for students intending to undertake the Faculty of Public Health Part A/Diploma examination.\n15 credits\n\n\nUsing Policy to Strengthen Health Systems\n\n\nThe module seeks to build on students' own experiences and knowledge of policy and public health systems. During the module, you will work individually and also in groups to develop a critical understanding of policy within particular public health systems. You will consider how policy to strengthen public health systems is developed and how improvements might be targeted at any combination of the regional, national, district, and community levels.\n\nIn the module, policy is interpreted broadly as 'purposeful and deliberate actions' through which efforts can be made to reshape or address issues within public health systems and is about power and politics (cf. Gilson, 2012). Public health systems are understood both as public health systems (covering, for example, health protection, health promotion and health care public health) and, more narrowly, as health care systems. The module is suitable for students with a broad public health and health care knowledge, but also for those with more limited experience.\n15 credits\n\n\nCapitalism and Crisis\n\n\nDuring this module, you will explore the relationship between capitalism and crisis through the prism of the causes of, and fallout from, the 2008 crash.\n\nYou will unpack the core concepts of the module - capitalism and crisis - and gain a brief historical overview of pre-2008 economic crises to contextualise and compare the main content of the module. You shall then go on to survey competing explanations of the 2008 crisis, by starting narrow (i.e. regulation of banking) and then broadening out (i.e. evolution of capitalism).\n\nBy the end of the module, you will have examined the economic and political fallout of  the 2008 crisis, be able to debate the extent to which the crisis was truly global, and discuss the variety of political responses to the crash.\n30 credits\n\n\nCitizen Participation in Planning and Development\n\n\nRecent decades have seen a proliferation of initiatives to involve citizens in policy-making, planning and urban governance. There is widespread agreement that 'citizen engagement' can play a positive role in democratizing urban development. However, public participation raises a range of significant challenges for urban professional practice. This module will draw on critical debates about the roles citizens and publics can and should play in shaping the city to reflect on the theory and practice of participation. The module is taught through seminars which structure learning, and help students to research case studies of participatory initiatives.\n15 credits\n\n\nUrban Informality\n\n\nThe overall aim of this module is to critically examine informality, with a particular but not exclusive focus on cities of the Global South. The module relies on a mixture of lectures, seminars and student-led group work, with the latter focusing on an in-depth case study of a selected city. It explores patterns and causes of informality and discusses the strengths and limitations of a range of theoretical approaches. It also analyses the success of different real-world urban planning responses (understood in broad terms), including government-led, donor-led and community-focused ones, in addressing key urban issues in the context of informality.\n15 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Core modules - choose from:\n\n\nResearch Foundations with Placement\n\n\nThis module allows students to develop and manage an individual, interdisciplinary research project.  The module aims to help students to develop and apply research skills and an appreciation of the issues involved in managing a research project; to develop an understanding of the role of research in relation to theoretical and practical dimensions of the chosen discipline; and to further and deepen knowledge in their chosen area of international development. The module combines an independent research project with experience of working (in-person or virtually) with a development related organisation.  Students make a detailed analysis of an issue, topic or problem agreed with their host organisation, develop a research proposal, carry out research while on placement, and produce both a dissertation and a shorter consultancy-style report based on their dissertation findings. The module is supported by lectures, seminars, fieldwork and one-to-one supervision.  It includes core research methods required to undertake a dissertation at Masters level in the field of International Development, which are assessed through a 2,500-word research proposal in the Spring, and a final 10,000-word dissertation alongside the 2,500-word placement report at the end of Summer.\n60 credits\n\n\nResearch Foundations without Placement\n\n\nThis module allows students to develop and manage an individual, interdisciplinary research project.  The module aims to help students to develop and apply research skills and an appreciation of the issues involved in managing a research project; to develop an understanding of the role of research in relation to theoretical and practical dimensions of the chosen discipline; and to further and deepen knowledge in their chosen area of international development. The module involves a supervised research project carried out either independently or as an attachment to a wider UoS research project.  Students make a detailed analysis of an issue, topic or problem agreed with their dissertation supervisor, develop a research proposal, carry out research, and produce a dissertation.  In the case of students working with a UoS research project, they will also engage with the Research Lead (who will usually, but not always, be their supervisor). The module is supported by lectures, seminars, fieldwork and one-to-one supervision.  It includes core research methods required to undertake a dissertation at Masters level in the field of International Development, which are assessed through a 2,500-word research proposal in the Spring, and a final 12,500-word dissertation at the end of Summer.\n60 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content of our courses is reviewed annually to make sure it's up-to-date and relevant.

Students pursued research projects around themes of gender, health, migration, earthquake disaster recovery, community forestry and climate change. This research had a direct impact through a final dissemination event which in recent years involved national political and media attention as well as regional and local stakeholders.The field class is an amazing part of the masters programme, which allows you to consolidate the theory and ideas learnt in lectures, in the field. As well as preparing you for the dissertation it is also a great chance to meet and learn from students of different cultures in a new and interesting environment.HelenaTanzaniaThe Tanzania field class gave students practical experience of field research. Working with our NGO partner KEDA, students were based in rural communities around Mt Kilimanjaro.They researched a range of issues that affect local communities such as health, environmental change and poverty alleviation among smallholder farmers. Each year students fed back to district officials and previously had even been interviewed for National TV.The field class in Tanzania provided the incredible opportunity to bring case studies we had always read about in books and lectures to life through hands-on fieldwork. I was able to learn about issues in water, health and sanitation through the voices of local people. Conducting research in the rich and vibrant culture of Tanzania was an unforgettable experience.ShahreenEcuadorThe Ecuador field class gave students the opportunity to work closely with our local partner Intercultural Outreach Initiative, which is based on the Island Isabela in the Galapagos Islands. Our students gained experience in field research by exploring a range of issues that affect the local communities such as food security, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) issues and ocean plastic pollution. Each year students feed back to district officials and local stakeholders.You can read a blog from one of our students about a virtual field class.The virtual field class provided an opportunity to experience the challenges of international fieldwork, and allowed us to develop skills in adapting research to changing circumstances and using video interviews for data collection, which will be useful skills for the future! It was a great way to gain an understanding and insight into the situation around plastics in the Galapagos, despite not being able to visit!EllePlacement\n\n\nThe dissertation with placement gives you valuable practical experience of working in a development organisation and engaging with development issues.\nYou'll spend six to eight weeks in June or July based in a host organisation, where you'll carry out a research project identified by the organisation and approved by the University.

In relation to the sharing of experiences and expertise, and in stimulating engaged discussion, throughout the module you will be encouraged to develop and use a reflective learning approach to consider shifts in your perception and understanding of the issues raised.\n15 credits\n\n\nIdeas and Practice in International Development\n\n\nThis module introduces students to key theoretical debates in international development. Co-taught by the Departments of Geography, Politics, Urban Studies and Planning, and Sociological Studies, it takes an interdisciplinary approach to exploring how thinking about development has changed over time, and why it has changed. The module also encourages students to think about the relationship between development theory and development practice.  It is spread over two semesters, in order to maximise the synergies between the core content of this module and the various other core and optional modules that students will take across the year.  The first semester focuses on the overarching questions of how development has been understood and conceptualised from the colonial period to the present. The changing development paradigms presented through weekly lectures are explored in depth through fortnightly seminars, each of which focuses on a set of key questions about changing theoretical perspectives and their implications for policy. The second semester then shifts focus onto a set of critical issues for policy and practice, including (for example) global health, migration, technology, urbanization and development finance.  The overall aim of the module is to build students' understanding of the origins of the idea of international development, changing debates about its meaning and purpose, and the implications of these for policy and practice.\n30 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Optional modules:\n\n\nTheory and Debates in Food Security and Food Justice\n\n\nFood Security and Food Justice are areas of increasing importance at local, national, transnational and global scales. Political and non-political agents at multiple scales have recognised that Global Hunger and Food Security (of which Food Justice is a primary component) is a key challenge requiring urgent interdisciplinary investigation and problem solving. There remains limited agreement as to how best to approach these issues. This module provides students with a background to the problems encompassed within the food security/food justice nexus by drawing on academic and policy debates that focus on both the macro as well as the micro impacts. By looking across food systems, the module also critically evaluates different strategies for mitigating the impacts of food insecurity and injustice.  In addition to academic, knowledge and critical thinking skills, the module will help students to develop the following attributes: Communication, Networking, Collaboration, Influencing, Inclusivity, Defining Purpose, and Growth Mindset.\n15 credits\n\n\nProfessional Skills for Development\n\n\nIn this module, which is taught across several departments drawing in a range of multi-disciplinary expertise, students gain a critically engaged understanding of professional practice in international development and develop a range of professional skills for future career paths.  Through the module students will learn to apply academic training to real-world situations, with a strong focus on employability-related skills.\n\n\n\nStudents will be taught about a set of key transferable and employability skills in keeping with the Sheffield Graduate Attributes before being given the option to choose between one of three specialist skill development tracks for hands-on group work.   The key transferable skills covered will include communications, project design and fundraising, policy analysis and consultancy work, ethics and cultural sensitivity.  Whichever of the specialist tracks they choose, students will work on a group-based project output and an individual written assessment.  While acquiring some specialist skills, all students will reflect on all key transferable skills offered in the first half of the module.\n15 credits\n\n\nThe Science of Environmental Change\n\n\nThis module gives students a critical understanding of the science behind historical and recent environmental change. The module covers the core debates in environmental change, the science behind these changes, methods for detecting environmental change, and the impacts of these changes, and projected future changes.\n15 credits\n\n\nEpidemiology\n\n\nEpidemiology is the discipline underpinning both effective public health practice and research into the causes, control and prevention of disease.  Knowledge and understanding of epidemiological concepts and methods is a basic requirement for effective public health practice. \n\nThis module will provide an introduction to epidemiology covering key epidemiological concepts; measures of disease; association and causation; confounding and bias.  It will also introduce research designs including cross-sectional, ecological, cohort, case-control and intervention studies and introduce population health measures such as screening.\n15 credits\n\n\nDisaster and Emergency Management\n\n\nDisasters and emergencies can strike any community.  It is not a question of whether a disaster will occur but when.  However, the likelihood, scale and impact of a disaster can be minimized through appropriate emergency planning, preparation and response by the community, governmental and non-governmental organisations.  This module will cover the key concepts of disaster and emergency management, explore some of the contemporary issues and develop students' knowledge and skills in this field.\n15 credits\n\n\nFoundations of GIS\n\n\nThis module introduces students to the core principles and skills of GIS. It covers the major sources of data used to study the lived environment and the variety of ways it can be displayed to aid both understanding and analysis. The module has a particular focus on techniques used in the analysis of socio-economic and demographic data and its potential applications. It is taught through a combination of lectures and practical workshops using ArcGIS software.\n15 credits\n\n\nThe Digital Self\n\n\nThis module explores how gender, age, race, class and other identities are being reimagined in what various commentators have called a 'social media age'. It provides students with an in-depth understanding of social media platforms, roles in people's identity negotiations, examining users' social media identities in different global contexts, and paying close attention to the intersections between different identities. It reviews debates about self and  identity formations from the earliest digital media moments and considers contemporary concerns, such as: anonymity and agency; selfies and influencers; online censorship, resistance and collective identities; social media fandoms; disconnection and digital detox\n15 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Optional modules:\n\n\nUK-Based Field Class\n\n\nThis optional, UK-based field class provides you with the opportunity to explore and engage with development issues through practical fieldwork experiences. Central to the module is a focus on developing critical reflectivity on the nature of development in a particular globalised and historicised context. You will have the opportunity to practise and build on research skills learnt in Semester 1 as well as dealing with issues of ethics, power and co-produced development research and practice. You will work in-person with UK partners or conduct remote or hybrid research with overseas partners, you will develop transferable skills through teamwork and engagement with a variety of stakeholders.\n\nFor field trips to run we require a minimum number of students to sign up for these modules. This varies depending on the specifics of individual field trips. If this number is not reached, the field trip will be cancelled. To assist with planning, this module must be selected by the end of the Semester One Add/Drop period.\n15 credits\n\n\nEnvironment, Society and Development: Key Issues, Debates and Concepts\n\n\nThis module engages critically with the key theoretical debates that shape the relationships between the environment, society and international development. By looking at current questions in development theory and their relationship to development practice in the context of the Anthropocene and environmental change, it encourages students to think critically about the ways in which interdisciplinary approaches define issues and problems, and the theoretical viewpoints that inform their actions. The module is taught primarily through seminars: these structure students' learning, and provide an environment in which they can develop their skills in researching, presenting and debating arguments drawn from the academic literature on international development.\n15 credits\n\n\nInternational Development Fieldclass\n\n\nThis optional field class module provides you with the opportunity to explore and engage with development issues through practical fieldwork experiences, and to enhance your understanding of grass-roots development organisations. \n\nCentral to the module is a focus on developing critical reflectivity on the nature of development in a particular globalised and historicised context.

This understanding is then applied to consider the challenge of living with climate change in the Global South. The module is taught through seminars and lectures. Lectures introduce and impart factual knowledge while seminars allow discussion and an emphasis on applying key concepts to practical situations. Together these structure students' learning, and provide an environment in which they can develop their skills in researching, presenting and debating arguments drawn from the wide ranging literature on climate change.\n15 credits\n\n\nHealth Promotion\n\n\nHealth Promotion enables people to take control over and improve their own health.  It builds on knowledge from behavioural science that individual behaviour and health are determined by the social, physical and economic environment.  This module will consider the nature of health promotion from a global perspective, the associated ideological dilemmas, current understanding of individual and group behaviours, methods of promoting health and the evaluation of health promotion.  The module will use the 5 key principles within the Ottawa Charter applied to health promotion as a framework.  Case studies will be used to give students practical examples of health promotion in different countries.\n15 credits\n\n\nPublic Health Informatics\n\n\nPublic Health Informatics is a module designed to look at how informatics and information technology can be used to help address some of the major issues in public health. Public health informatics was traditionally defined as the systematic application of information and computer science and technology to public health practice, research, and learning (Yasnoff, 2000). In this module, we examine this rapidly changing field, using a combination of lectures, individual and group exercises and self directed learning. Key issues around the local, national and international contributions that technology can make to public health are critically examined and students are given a theoretical and practical grounding in this increasingly important discipline.\n15 credits\n\n\nCommunicable Disease Control\n\n\nHealth protection is one of the cornerstones of public health.  The control of communicable diseases is one of the major functions of health protection.  This module will cover the principles of surveillance, outbreak management, immunisation programmes, and prevention and control of infectious diseases.  It will also present a broad range of common infectious disease topics including HIV, tuberculosis, meningitis, diarrhoeal illnesses and hospital acquired infections.  This module would provide the essential foundations for students intending to undertake the Faculty of Public Health Part A/Diploma examination.\n15 credits\n\n\nUsing Policy to Strengthen Health Systems\n\n\nThe module seeks to build on students' own experiences and knowledge of policy and public health systems. During the module, you will work individually and also in groups to develop a critical understanding of policy within particular public health systems. You will consider how policy to strengthen public health systems is developed and how improvements might be targeted at any combination of the regional, national, district, and community levels.\n\nIn the module, policy is interpreted broadly as 'purposeful and deliberate actions' through which efforts can be made to reshape or address issues within public health systems and is about power and politics (cf. Gilson, 2012). Public health systems are understood both as public health systems (covering, for example, health protection, health promotion and health care public health) and, more narrowly, as health care systems. The module is suitable for students with a broad public health and health care knowledge, but also for those with more limited experience.\n15 credits\n\n\nCapitalism and Crisis\n\n\nDuring this module, you will explore the relationship between capitalism and crisis through the prism of the causes of, and fallout from, the 2008 crash.\n\nYou will unpack the core concepts of the module - capitalism and crisis - and gain a brief historical overview of pre-2008 economic crises to contextualise and compare the main content of the module. You shall then go on to survey competing explanations of the 2008 crisis, by starting narrow (i.e. regulation of banking) and then broadening out (i.e. evolution of capitalism).\n\nBy the end of the module, you will have examined the economic and political fallout of  the 2008 crisis, be able to debate the extent to which the crisis was truly global, and discuss the variety of political responses to the crash.\n30 credits\n\n\nCitizen Participation in Planning and Development\n\n\nRecent decades have seen a proliferation of initiatives to involve citizens in policy-making, planning and urban governance. There is widespread agreement that 'citizen engagement' can play a positive role in democratizing urban development. However, public participation raises a range of significant challenges for urban professional practice. This module will draw on critical debates about the roles citizens and publics can and should play in shaping the city to reflect on the theory and practice of participation. The module is taught through seminars which structure learning, and help students to research case studies of participatory initiatives.\n15 credits\n\n\nUrban Informality\n\n\nThe overall aim of this module is to critically examine informality, with a particular but not exclusive focus on cities of the Global South. The module relies on a mixture of lectures, seminars and student-led group work, with the latter focusing on an in-depth case study of a selected city. It explores patterns and causes of informality and discusses the strengths and limitations of a range of theoretical approaches. It also analyses the success of different real-world urban planning responses (understood in broad terms), including government-led, donor-led and community-focused ones, in addressing key urban issues in the context of informality.\n15 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Core modules - choose from:\n\n\nResearch Foundations with Placement\n\n\nThis module allows students to develop and manage an individual, interdisciplinary research project.  The module aims to help students to develop and apply research skills and an appreciation of the issues involved in managing a research project; to develop an understanding of the role of research in relation to theoretical and practical dimensions of the chosen discipline; and to further and deepen knowledge in their chosen area of international development. The module combines an independent research project with experience of working (in-person or virtually) with a development related organisation.  Students make a detailed analysis of an issue, topic or problem agreed with their host organisation, develop a research proposal, carry out research while on placement, and produce both a dissertation and a shorter consultancy-style report based on their dissertation findings. The module is supported by lectures, seminars, fieldwork and one-to-one supervision.  It includes core research methods required to undertake a dissertation at Masters level in the field of International Development, which are assessed through a 2,500-word research proposal in the Spring, and a final 10,000-word dissertation alongside the 2,500-word placement report at the end of Summer.\n60 credits\n\n\nResearch Foundations without Placement\n\n\nThis module allows students to develop and manage an individual, interdisciplinary research project.  The module aims to help students to develop and apply research skills and an appreciation of the issues involved in managing a research project; to develop an understanding of the role of research in relation to theoretical and practical dimensions of the chosen discipline; and to further and deepen knowledge in their chosen area of international development. The module involves a supervised research project carried out either independently or as an attachment to a wider UoS research project.  Students make a detailed analysis of an issue, topic or problem agreed with their dissertation supervisor, develop a research proposal, carry out research, and produce a dissertation.  In the case of students working with a UoS research project, they will also engage with the Research Lead (who will usually, but not always, be their supervisor). The module is supported by lectures, seminars, fieldwork and one-to-one supervision.  It includes core research methods required to undertake a dissertation at Masters level in the field of International Development, which are assessed through a 2,500-word research proposal in the Spring, and a final 12,500-word dissertation at the end of Summer.\n60 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content of our courses is reviewed annually to make sure it's up-to-date and relevant.

Students pursued research projects around themes of gender, health, migration, earthquake disaster recovery, community forestry and climate change. This research had a direct impact through a final dissemination event which in recent years involved national political and media attention as well as regional and local stakeholders.The field class is an amazing part of the masters programme, which allows you to consolidate the theory and ideas learnt in lectures, in the field. As well as preparing you for the dissertation it is also a great chance to meet and learn from students of different cultures in a new and interesting environment.Helena\nTanzania: The Tanzania field class gave students practical experience of field research. Working with our NGO partner KEDA, students were based in rural communities around Mt Kilimanjaro.They researched a range of issues that affect local communities such as health, environmental change and poverty alleviation among smallholder farmers. Each year students fed back to district officials and previously had even been interviewed for National TV.The field class in Tanzania provided the incredible opportunity to bring case studies we had always read about in books and lectures to life through hands-on fieldwork. I was able to learn about issues in water, health and sanitation through the voices of local people. Conducting research in the rich and vibrant culture of Tanzania was an unforgettable experience.Shahreen\nEcuador: The Ecuador field class gave students the opportunity to work closely with our local partner Intercultural Outreach Initiative, which is based on the Island Isabela in the Galapagos Islands. Our students gained experience in field research by exploring a range of issues that affect the local communities such as food security, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) issues and ocean plastic pollution. Each year students feed back to district officials and local stakeholders.You can read a blog from one of our students about a virtual field class.The virtual field class provided an opportunity to experience the challenges of international fieldwork, and allowed us to develop skills in adapting research to changing circumstances and using video interviews for data collection, which will be useful skills for the future! It was a great way to gain an understanding and insight into the situation around plastics in the Galapagos, despite not being able to visit!Elle\n[DEFINITION_LIST]\nRecent topics for the dissertation with placement: Exploring the impact of land certification programmes on land tenure security and land conflicts for peasants in IndonesiaInclusive education for students with visual, hearing and physical disabilities: Barriers and experiences in Gondar, Northern EthiopiaSustainable livelihoods and the urban poor: The importance of rural-urban connections for second generation rural-urban migrants in Kampala, UgandaShifting and negotiating identities: Shan refugees in Northern ThailandBreaking dichotomies and the process of social reproduction: A case study of urban market women in El AltoLife histories of giving: Individuals’ changing relationships with charities over time Governance and livelihoods: The future of aquaculture on Lake Bunot, San Pablo, PhilippinesExploration of how recognised factors affect public perceptions of climate change within the North of EnglandLearning from international emergency responses: a critical assessment of how the British Red Cross learns from its international emergency responses\n[DEFINITION_LIST]\nIntroduction to Research Methods: This module is offered across several programmes. Learning activities for the module are tailored to your individual specialist areas to provide learning that is relevant and specific to your chosen degree programme.\n\n\n\nThis module provides students with an introduction to quantitative and qualitative research methods; it covers all stages of the research process from planning and design and research ethics and public and patient involvement, through to data collection and analysis and dissemination stages. It is specifically designed for students who do not have prior research experience and would be suitable for students from a range of backgrounds, but is particularly relevant to those interested in applied health related research. The course also provides a foundation for further learning in specific research methods.\n15 credits\nCritical Reflections in Global Health: Global health has been described as the art and science of preventing disease, prolonging life, and promoting health through the organised efforts of society, with the goal being the attainment of biological, physical, and mental well-being of all members of society. In this module we take an inter-disciplinary approach to explore these themes.\n\nAligned with the themes of our key reader (7th edition of the Oxford Textbook of Global Public Health) we will consider some of the key concepts of global health, explore some of the determinants of health, and consider some of the key function / methods applied to address global health issues. We will then reflect on these themes in relation to the practice of global health through the lens of specific health challenges. Throughout the module themes such as inequalities in health, complexities in our response, and the political, social, and economic context within which we work will be repeatedly raised and discussed. \n\nIn delivering this module we are excited to have secured the expertise of regional, national, and international leaders and experts who will share their learnings on a diverse range of subjects that include socioeconomic and health inequalities, health intelligence, and sexual and reproductive health. In relation to the sharing of experiences and expertise, and in stimulating engaged discussion, throughout the module you will be encouraged to develop and use a reflective learning approach to consider shifts in your perception and understanding of the issues raised.\n15 credits\nIdeas and Practice in International Development: This module introduces students to key theoretical debates in international development.

Together these structure students' learning, and provide an environment in which they can develop their skills in researching, presenting and debating arguments drawn from the wide ranging literature on climate change.\n15 credits\nHealth Promotion: Health Promotion enables people to take control over and improve their own health.  It builds on knowledge from behavioural science that individual behaviour and health are determined by the social, physical and economic environment.  This module will consider the nature of health promotion from a global perspective, the associated ideological dilemmas, current understanding of individual and group behaviours, methods of promoting health and the evaluation of health promotion.  The module will use the 5 key principles within the Ottawa Charter applied to health promotion as a framework.  Case studies will be used to give students practical examples of health promotion in different countries.\n15 credits\nPublic Health Informatics: Public Health Informatics is a module designed to look at how informatics and information technology can be used to help address some of the major issues in public health. Public health informatics was traditionally defined as the systematic application of information and computer science and technology to public health practice, research, and learning (Yasnoff, 2000). In this module, we examine this rapidly changing field, using a combination of lectures, individual and group exercises and self directed learning. Key issues around the local, national and international contributions that technology can make to public health are critically examined and students are given a theoretical and practical grounding in this increasingly important discipline.\n15 credits\nCommunicable Disease Control: Health protection is one of the cornerstones of public health.  The control of communicable diseases is one of the major functions of health protection.  This module will cover the principles of surveillance, outbreak management, immunisation programmes, and prevention and control of infectious diseases.  It will also present a broad range of common infectious disease topics including HIV, tuberculosis, meningitis, diarrhoeal illnesses and hospital acquired infections.  This module would provide the essential foundations for students intending to undertake the Faculty of Public Health Part A/Diploma examination.\n15 credits\nUsing Policy to Strengthen Health Systems: The module seeks to build on students' own experiences and knowledge of policy and public health systems. During the module, you will work individually and also in groups to develop a critical understanding of policy within particular public health systems. You will consider how policy to strengthen public health systems is developed and how improvements might be targeted at any combination of the regional, national, district, and community levels.\n\nIn the module, policy is interpreted broadly as 'purposeful and deliberate actions' through which efforts can be made to reshape or address issues within public health systems and is about power and politics (cf. Gilson, 2012). Public health systems are understood both as public health systems (covering, for example, health protection, health promotion and health care public health) and, more narrowly, as health care systems. The module is suitable for students with a broad public health and health care knowledge, but also for those with more limited experience.\n15 credits\nCapitalism and Crisis: During this module, you will explore the relationship between capitalism and crisis through the prism of the causes of, and fallout from, the 2008 crash.\n\nYou will unpack the core concepts of the module - capitalism and crisis - and gain a brief historical overview of pre-2008 economic crises to contextualise and compare the main content of the module. You shall then go on to survey competing explanations of the 2008 crisis, by starting narrow (i.e. regulation of banking) and then broadening out (i.e. evolution of capitalism).\n\nBy the end of the module, you will have examined the economic and political fallout of  the 2008 crisis, be able to debate the extent to which the crisis was truly global, and discuss the variety of political responses to the crash.\n30 credits\nCitizen Participation in Planning and Development: Recent decades have seen a proliferation of initiatives to involve citizens in policy-making, planning and urban governance. There is widespread agreement that 'citizen engagement' can play a positive role in democratizing urban development. However, public participation raises a range of significant challenges for urban professional practice. This module will draw on critical debates about the roles citizens and publics can and should play in shaping the city to reflect on the theory and practice of participation. The module is taught through seminars which structure learning, and help students to research case studies of participatory initiatives.\n15 credits\nUrban Informality: The overall aim of this module is to critically examine informality, with a particular but not exclusive focus on cities of the Global South. The module relies on a mixture of lectures, seminars and student-led group work, with the latter focusing on an in-depth case study of a selected city. It explores patterns and causes of informality and discusses the strengths and limitations of a range of theoretical approaches. It also analyses the success of different real-world urban planning responses (understood in broad terms), including government-led, donor-led and community-focused ones, in addressing key urban issues in the context of informality.\n15 credits\n[DEFINITION_LIST]\nResearch Foundations with Placement: This module allows students to develop and manage an individual, interdisciplinary research project.  The module aims to help students to develop and apply research skills and an appreciation of the issues involved in managing a research project; to develop an understanding of the role of research in relation to theoretical and practical dimensions of the chosen discipline; and to further and deepen knowledge in their chosen area of international development. The module combines an independent research project with experience of working (in-person or virtually) with a development related organisation.  Students make a detailed analysis of an issue, topic or problem agreed with their host organisation, develop a research proposal, carry out research while on placement, and produce both a dissertation and a shorter consultancy-style report based on their dissertation findings. The module is supported by lectures, seminars, fieldwork and one-to-one supervision.  It includes core research methods required to undertake a dissertation at Masters level in the field of International Development, which are assessed through a 2,500-word research proposal in the Spring, and a final 10,000-word dissertation alongside the 2,500-word placement report at the end of Summer.\n60 credits\nResearch Foundations without Placement: This module allows students to develop and manage an individual, interdisciplinary research project.  The module aims to help students to develop and apply research skills and an appreciation of the issues involved in managing a research project; to develop an understanding of the role of research in relation to theoretical and practical dimensions of the chosen discipline; and to further and deepen knowledge in their chosen area of international development. The module involves a supervised research project carried out either independently or as an attachment to a wider UoS research project.  Students make a detailed analysis of an issue, topic or problem agreed with their dissertation supervisor, develop a research proposal, carry out research, and produce a dissertation.  In the case of students working with a UoS research project, they will also engage with the Research Lead (who will usually, but not always, be their supervisor). The module is supported by lectures, seminars, fieldwork and one-to-one supervision.  It includes core research methods required to undertake a dissertation at Masters level in the field of International Development, which are assessed through a 2,500-word research proposal in the Spring, and a final 12,500-word dissertation at the end of Summer.\n60 credits\n[CARD]\nInternational Development (Masters in Public Health)\nMPH\n2025-26 entry\nInternational Development (Masters in Public Health)\nMPH\n\n\n      \n            \n                \n      School of Geography and Planning,\n\n                  Faculty of Social Sciences\n\n\n      \n            \n                \n      School of Medicine and Population Health,\n\n                  Faculty of Health\n\n\n          Explore the intersections of international development and healthcare policy and practice, while developing the skills to work in health and development organisations around the world.\n    \n\n\nStart date\n\n          September 2025\n      \n\nDuration\n\n1 year\n\n\nAttendance\n\nFull-time\n\n\n\n Course fee\n\n\n\nApply for this course\nRegister for updates\n[CARD]\nExplore this course:\n[CARD]\nAn optional international field class encourages you to engage with overseas development and community organisations through an intensive week of activities.\nWe also offer a lower cost and more sustainable UK-based ‘hybrid’ field class as an alternative.\nInternational field class locations are subject to variation and subject to the number of students participating, but previous destinations have included Peru, Nepal and South Africa.\nThe costs of optional field classes modules and placements are not included in your tuition fees.

Learning activities for the module are tailored to your individual specialist areas to provide learning that is relevant and specific to your chosen degree programme.\n\n\n\nThis module provides students with an introduction to quantitative and qualitative research methods; it covers all stages of the research process from planning and design and research ethics and public and patient involvement, through to data collection and analysis and dissemination stages. It is specifically designed for students who do not have prior research experience and would be suitable for students from a range of backgrounds, but is particularly relevant to those interested in applied health related research. The course also provides a foundation for further learning in specific research methods.\n15 credits\n\n\nCritical Reflections in Global Health\n\n\nGlobal health has been described as the art and science of preventing disease, prolonging life, and promoting health through the organised efforts of society, with the goal being the attainment of biological, physical, and mental well-being of all members of society. In this module we take an inter-disciplinary approach to explore these themes.\n\nAligned with the themes of our key reader (7th edition of the Oxford Textbook of Global Public Health) we will consider some of the key concepts of global health, explore some of the determinants of health, and consider some of the key function / methods applied to address global health issues. We will then reflect on these themes in relation to the practice of global health through the lens of specific health challenges. Throughout the module themes such as inequalities in health, complexities in our response, and the political, social, and economic context within which we work will be repeatedly raised and discussed. \n\nIn delivering this module we are excited to have secured the expertise of regional, national, and international leaders and experts who will share their learnings on a diverse range of subjects that include socioeconomic and health inequalities, health intelligence, and sexual and reproductive health. In relation to the sharing of experiences and expertise, and in stimulating engaged discussion, throughout the module you will be encouraged to develop and use a reflective learning approach to consider shifts in your perception and understanding of the issues raised.\n15 credits\n\n\nIdeas and Practice in International Development\n\n\nThis module introduces students to key theoretical debates in international development. Co-taught by the Departments of Geography, Politics, Urban Studies and Planning, and Sociological Studies, it takes an interdisciplinary approach to exploring how thinking about development has changed over time, and why it has changed. The module also encourages students to think about the relationship between development theory and development practice.  It is spread over two semesters, in order to maximise the synergies between the core content of this module and the various other core and optional modules that students will take across the year.  The first semester focuses on the overarching questions of how development has been understood and conceptualised from the colonial period to the present. The changing development paradigms presented through weekly lectures are explored in depth through fortnightly seminars, each of which focuses on a set of key questions about changing theoretical perspectives and their implications for policy. The second semester then shifts focus onto a set of critical issues for policy and practice, including (for example) global health, migration, technology, urbanization and development finance.  The overall aim of the module is to build students' understanding of the origins of the idea of international development, changing debates about its meaning and purpose, and the implications of these for policy and practice.\n30 credits\n[CARD]\nUK-Based Field Class\n\n\nThis optional, UK-based field class provides you with the opportunity to explore and engage with development issues through practical fieldwork experiences. Central to the module is a focus on developing critical reflectivity on the nature of development in a particular globalised and historicised context. You will have the opportunity to practise and build on research skills learnt in Semester 1 as well as dealing with issues of ethics, power and co-produced development research and practice. You will work in-person with UK partners or conduct remote or hybrid research with overseas partners, you will develop transferable skills through teamwork and engagement with a variety of stakeholders.\n\nFor field trips to run we require a minimum number of students to sign up for these modules. This varies depending on the specifics of individual field trips. If this number is not reached, the field trip will be cancelled. To assist with planning, this module must be selected by the end of the Semester One Add/Drop period.\n15 credits\n\n\nEnvironment, Society and Development: Key Issues, Debates and Concepts\n\n\nThis module engages critically with the key theoretical debates that shape the relationships between the environment, society and international development. By looking at current questions in development theory and their relationship to development practice in the context of the Anthropocene and environmental change, it encourages students to think critically about the ways in which interdisciplinary approaches define issues and problems, and the theoretical viewpoints that inform their actions. The module is taught primarily through seminars: these structure students' learning, and provide an environment in which they can develop their skills in researching, presenting and debating arguments drawn from the academic literature on international development.\n15 credits\n\n\nInternational Development Fieldclass\n\n\nThis optional field class module provides you with the opportunity to explore and engage with development issues through practical fieldwork experiences, and to enhance your understanding of grass-roots development organisations. \n\nCentral to the module is a focus on developing critical reflectivity on the nature of development in a particular globalised and historicised context. You will have the opportunity to practise and build on research skills learnt in Semester 1 as well as dealing with issues of ethics, power and co-produced development research and practice. \n\nYou will work with an International partner, and you will develop transferable skills through teamwork and engagement with a variety of stakeholders.\n\nFor field trips to run we require a minimum number of students to sign up for these modules. This varies depending on the specifics of individual field trips. If this number is not reached, the field trip will be cancelled. To assist with planning, this module must be selected by the end of the Semester One Add/Drop period.\n15 credits\n\n\nManaging Climate Change\n\n\nThis module aims to provide students with a strong understanding of the social and physical science of climate change with relevance to international development.  This understanding is then applied to consider the challenge of living with climate change in the Global South. The module is taught through seminars and lectures. Lectures introduce and impart factual knowledge while seminars allow discussion and an emphasis on applying key concepts to practical situations. Together these structure students' learning, and provide an environment in which they can develop their skills in researching, presenting and debating arguments drawn from the wide ranging literature on climate change.\n15 credits\n\n\nHealth Promotion\n\n\nHealth Promotion enables people to take control over and improve their own health.  It builds on knowledge from behavioural science that individual behaviour and health are determined by the social, physical and economic environment.  This module will consider the nature of health promotion from a global perspective, the associated ideological dilemmas, current understanding of individual and group behaviours, methods of promoting health and the evaluation of health promotion.  The module will use the 5 key principles within the Ottawa Charter applied to health promotion as a framework.  Case studies will be used to give students practical examples of health promotion in different countries.\n15 credits\n\n\nPublic Health Informatics\n\n\nPublic Health Informatics is a module designed to look at how informatics and information technology can be used to help address some of the major issues in public health.

Throughout the module themes such as inequalities in health, complexities in our response, and the political, social, and economic context within which we work will be repeatedly raised and discussed. \n\nIn delivering this module we are excited to have secured the expertise of regional, national, and international leaders and experts who will share their learnings on a diverse range of subjects that include socioeconomic and health inequalities, health intelligence, and sexual and reproductive health. In relation to the sharing of experiences and expertise, and in stimulating engaged discussion, throughout the module you will be encouraged to develop and use a reflective learning approach to consider shifts in your perception and understanding of the issues raised.\nEpidemiology is the discipline underpinning both effective public health practice and research into the causes, control and prevention of disease.  Knowledge and understanding of epidemiological concepts and methods is a basic requirement for effective public health practice. \n\nThis module will provide an introduction to epidemiology covering key epidemiological concepts; measures of disease; association and causation; confounding and bias.  It will also introduce research designs including cross-sectional, ecological, cohort, case-control and intervention studies and introduce population health measures such as screening.\nYear two modules will vary depending on the specialisation and institution chosen, but you will complete your dissertation during this time.\nOptional modules:\n\n\nDisaster and Emergency Management\n\n\nDisasters and emergencies can strike any community.  It is not a question of whether a disaster will occur but when.  However, the likelihood, scale and impact of a disaster can be minimized through appropriate emergency planning, preparation and response by the community, governmental and non-governmental organisations.  This module will cover the key concepts of disaster and emergency management, explore some of the contemporary issues and develop students' knowledge and skills in this field.\n15 credits\n\n\nConfronting Public Health Problems\n\n\nScHARR is well known for its high-quality and impactful research. Engaging with the research process on relevant public health topics through problem-based learning will provide students with practical skills not just for future research but also transferable skills for other areas relating to public health, for example policy making and designing and implementing public health interventions. This module is offered as an optional module on the MPH, and it will complement the core modules in allowing students to concentrate on specific aspects of public health practice and research, and develop and advance transferable employability skills.\n15 credits\n\n\nFurther Statistics for Health Science Researchers\n\n\nThe unit covers fundamental statistical concepts, and both simple statistical methods and the more widely used advanced methods of multiple regression, survival analysis and generalised linear models. It will be a practical module, including the teaching of the statistical software SPSS, equipping students with the knowledge and skills necessary to design and analyse a study to answer specific research questions; to understand and critically appraise the literature; and to present research findings in a suitable fashion.\n15 credits\n\n\nCommunicable Disease Control\n\n\nHealth protection is one of the cornerstones of public health.  The control of communicable diseases is one of the major functions of health protection.  This module will cover the principles of surveillance, outbreak management, immunisation programmes, and prevention and control of infectious diseases.  It will also present a broad range of common infectious disease topics including HIV, tuberculosis, meningitis, diarrhoeal illnesses and hospital acquired infections.  This module would provide the essential foundations for students intending to undertake the Faculty of Public Health Part A/Diploma examination.\n15 credits\n\n\nEconomic Evaluation and Healthcare Financing\n\n\nThis module introduces the basic principles of economic evaluation as applied to healthcare interventions and health care financing. The core part of the course focuses on economic evaluation and covers the different types of evaluations that are available and the various stages and techniques that need to be applied to generate results. As alternative techniques are described, the strength and weakness of each will be highlighted, with the students being encouraged to critically appraise their appropriateness to different contexts. The course also introduces the concepts of markets and market failure, models of health care financing and objectives of health care systems. These topics draw on economic theory and use it to identify possible solutions to health system problems. Health system performance measurement will also be covered, linking the economic and health system content to empirical studies.\n15 credits\n\n\nHealth Promotion\n\n\nHealth Promotion enables people to take control over and improve their own health.  It builds on knowledge from behavioural science that individual behaviour and health are determined by the social, physical and economic environment.  This module will consider the nature of health promotion from a global perspective, the associated ideological dilemmas, current understanding of individual and group behaviours, methods of promoting health and the evaluation of health promotion.  The module will use the 5 key principles within the Ottawa Charter applied to health promotion as a framework.  Case studies will be used to give students practical examples of health promotion in different countries.\n15 credits\n\n\nPublic Health Informatics\n\n\nPublic Health Informatics is a module designed to look at how informatics and information technology can be used to help address some of the major issues in public health. Public health informatics was traditionally defined as the systematic application of information and computer science and technology to public health practice, research, and learning (Yasnoff, 2000). In this module, we examine this rapidly changing field, using a combination of lectures, individual and group exercises and self directed learning. Key issues around the local, national and international contributions that technology can make to public health are critically examined and students are given a theoretical and practical grounding in this increasingly important discipline.\n15 credits\n\n\nSystematic Reviews and Critical Appraisal Techniques\n\n\nTo familiarise students with principles of systematic reviews and critical appraisal and the acquisition of skills necessary to undertake such work.  The unit includes an introduction to information systems; principles of systematic literature reviews and critical appraisal; search strategies; computer-assisted search methods; practicalities of writing up the results of a systematic review; introduction to Meta- analysis; and dissemination of findings.\n15 credits\n\n\nQualitative Research Design and Analysis\n\n\nOn completing the module students will be expected to be able to: understand a range of qualitative research approaches, data collection methods and forms of analysis; plan and undertake a simple analysis of student-generated qualitative data; critically appraise the methods and results of qualitative research.\n15 credits\n\n\nFoundations in Health Policy, Leadership and Management\n\n\nThis campus-based module, integrates the principles of health policy with the foundations in leadership and associated management of health care teams, services and systems, in the context of rapid changes and advances locally, nationally and internationally. There will be a particular focus on public health and health system issues throughout the module. \n\nA number of different cases will be used to illustrate the complexity of developing (or not) health policy and how related health and public health services are then managed and evaluated. Students will be supported in developing critical thinking about the relative effectiveness of different approaches to policy development and analysis. They will learn key approaches to leadership and management of health teams, services and systems, as well as gain an understanding of the complex interplay of the different actors in the health systems. They will acquire an appreciation of some of the key challenges and issues encountered in contemporary health service and health system management. Through exploration of these topics and critical analysis, students will develop know how to systematically assess,  as well as management and improvement by analysing several health care services within the broader cultural, commercial and political contexts. Over the course of the module students will work in small groups  to gain practical understanding of how to apply management and leadership theories and styles in different health care contexts, from health care teams to public health and health systems. \n15 credits\n\n\nPsychological and sociological approaches to health\n\n\nThere is increasing awareness amongst health professionals of the need to focus on social and psychosocial aspects of illness, as well as biomedical. This module provides an introduction to contemporary research in the field of health psychology covering both traditional mainstream approaches and newly emerging critical studies. It combines this with a sociological approach, studying how society is structured by looking at the patterns of relationships that have an existence over and above individuals and how this influences health and illness.  In this respect it looks at how health is distributed as a consequence of how people are related to each other in a number of ways.  This involves looking at how, for example, social class and gender relations result in varying patterns and experiences of health.\n\nTopics covered include: approaches within health psychology, for example understanding and changing health behaviour, the role of psychology in health and illness, and the application and relevance of contemporary work in global and cultural context.  The approach to sociology involves understanding how people share and shape understandings of what it means to be healthy or ill. We will explore how the meaning of health can shape encounters with various health professionals and how concepts of health and illness can shape and control the behaviour of different populations.\n15 credits\nOptional modules:\nDisasters and emergencies can strike any community.

There may be changes before you start your course. From May of the year of entry, formal programme regulations will be available in our Programme Regulations Finder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Europubhealth modules\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Core modules:\n\n\nHealth Needs Assessment, Planning and Evaluation\n\n\nAssessing health needs and tackling health inequalities are key aspects of public health work at the local, national and international level.  This module will provide students with an understanding of the main approaches to, and methodologies for, conducting Health Needs Assessments and will equip them with an understanding of programme planning, and the monitoring and evaluation of programmes.\n15 credits\n\n\nIntroduction to Research Methods\n\n\nThis module is offered across several programmes. Learning activities for the module are tailored to your individual specialist areas to provide learning that is relevant and specific to your chosen degree programme.\n\n\n\nThis module provides students with an introduction to quantitative and qualitative research methods; it covers all stages of the research process from planning and design and research ethics and public and patient involvement, through to data collection and analysis and dissemination stages. It is specifically designed for students who do not have prior research experience and would be suitable for students from a range of backgrounds, but is particularly relevant to those interested in applied health related research. The course also provides a foundation for further learning in specific research methods.\n15 credits\n\n\nIntroduction to Statistics and Critical Appraisal\n\n\nThe unit introduces students to basic  concepts and techniques such as hypothesis testing and confidence interval estimation in statistics.  Students will learn some simple statistical methods and the principles behind some advanced methods such as regression.  It will equip students with the knowledge and skills necessary to understand and critically appraise statistics in research literature.The course is not aimed at 'doers' of statistics, that is, students who are going to design their own studies to collect and analyse their own data. It will not teach you how to analyse, present and report your own data.\n15 credits\n\n\nCritical Reflections in Global Health\n\n\nGlobal health has been described as the art and science of preventing disease, prolonging life, and promoting health through the organised efforts of society, with the goal being the attainment of biological, physical, and mental well-being of all members of society. In this module we take an inter-disciplinary approach to explore these themes.\n\nAligned with the themes of our key reader (7th edition of the Oxford Textbook of Global Public Health) we will consider some of the key concepts of global health, explore some of the determinants of health, and consider some of the key function / methods applied to address global health issues. We will then reflect on these themes in relation to the practice of global health through the lens of specific health challenges. Throughout the module themes such as inequalities in health, complexities in our response, and the political, social, and economic context within which we work will be repeatedly raised and discussed. \n\nIn delivering this module we are excited to have secured the expertise of regional, national, and international leaders and experts who will share their learnings on a diverse range of subjects that include socioeconomic and health inequalities, health intelligence, and sexual and reproductive health. In relation to the sharing of experiences and expertise, and in stimulating engaged discussion, throughout the module you will be encouraged to develop and use a reflective learning approach to consider shifts in your perception and understanding of the issues raised.\n15 credits\n\n\nEpidemiology\n\n\nEpidemiology is the discipline underpinning both effective public health practice and research into the causes, control and prevention of disease.  Knowledge and understanding of epidemiological concepts and methods is a basic requirement for effective public health practice. \n\nThis module will provide an introduction to epidemiology covering key epidemiological concepts; measures of disease; association and causation; confounding and bias.  It will also introduce research designs including cross-sectional, ecological, cohort, case-control and intervention studies and introduce population health measures such as screening.\n15 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Year two modules will vary depending on the specialisation and institution chosen, but you will complete your dissertation during this time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Optional modules:\n\n\nDisaster and Emergency Management\n\n\nDisasters and emergencies can strike any community.  It is not a question of whether a disaster will occur but when.  However, the likelihood, scale and impact of a disaster can be minimized through appropriate emergency planning, preparation and response by the community, governmental and non-governmental organisations.  This module will cover the key concepts of disaster and emergency management, explore some of the contemporary issues and develop students' knowledge and skills in this field.\n15 credits\n\n\nConfronting Public Health Problems\n\n\nScHARR is well known for its high-quality and impactful research. Engaging with the research process on relevant public health topics through problem-based learning will provide students with practical skills not just for future research but also transferable skills for other areas relating to public health, for example policy making and designing and implementing public health interventions. This module is offered as an optional module on the MPH, and it will complement the core modules in allowing students to concentrate on specific aspects of public health practice and research, and develop and advance transferable employability skills.\n15 credits\n\n\nFurther Statistics for Health Science Researchers\n\n\nThe unit covers fundamental statistical concepts, and both simple statistical methods and the more widely used advanced methods of multiple regression, survival analysis and generalised linear models. It will be a practical module, including the teaching of the statistical software SPSS, equipping students with the knowledge and skills necessary to design and analyse a study to answer specific research questions; to understand and critically appraise the literature; and to present research findings in a suitable fashion.\n15 credits\n\n\nCommunicable Disease Control\n\n\nHealth protection is one of the cornerstones of public health.  The control of communicable diseases is one of the major functions of health protection.  This module will cover the principles of surveillance, outbreak management, immunisation programmes, and prevention and control of infectious diseases.  It will also present a broad range of common infectious disease topics including HIV, tuberculosis, meningitis, diarrhoeal illnesses and hospital acquired infections.  This module would provide the essential foundations for students intending to undertake the Faculty of Public Health Part A/Diploma examination.\n15 credits\n\n\nEconomic Evaluation and Healthcare Financing\n\n\nThis module introduces the basic principles of economic evaluation as applied to healthcare interventions and health care financing. The core part of the course focuses on economic evaluation and covers the different types of evaluations that are available and the various stages and techniques that need to be applied to generate results. As alternative techniques are described, the strength and weakness of each will be highlighted, with the students being encouraged to critically appraise their appropriateness to different contexts. The course also introduces the concepts of markets and market failure, models of health care financing and objectives of health care systems. These topics draw on economic theory and use it to identify possible solutions to health system problems. Health system performance measurement will also be covered, linking the economic and health system content to empirical studies.\n15 credits\n\n\nHealth Promotion\n\n\nHealth Promotion enables people to take control over and improve their own health.  It builds on knowledge from behavioural science that individual behaviour and health are determined by the social, physical and economic environment.  This module will consider the nature of health promotion from a global perspective, the associated ideological dilemmas, current understanding of individual and group behaviours, methods of promoting health and the evaluation of health promotion.  The module will use the 5 key principles within the Ottawa Charter applied to health promotion as a framework.  Case studies will be used to give students practical examples of health promotion in different countries.\n15 credits\n\n\nPublic Health Informatics\n\n\nPublic Health Informatics is a module designed to look at how informatics and information technology can be used to help address some of the major issues in public health. Public health informatics was traditionally defined as the systematic application of information and computer science and technology to public health practice, research, and learning (Yasnoff, 2000). In this module, we examine this rapidly changing field, using a combination of lectures, individual and group exercises and self directed learning. Key issues around the local, national and international contributions that technology can make to public health are critically examined and students are given a theoretical and practical grounding in this increasingly important discipline.\n15 credits\n\n\nSystematic Reviews and Critical Appraisal Techniques\n\n\nTo familiarise students with principles of systematic reviews and critical appraisal and the acquisition of skills necessary to undertake such work.  The unit includes an introduction to information systems; principles of systematic literature reviews and critical appraisal; search strategies; computer-assisted search methods; practicalities of writing up the results of a systematic review; introduction to Meta- analysis; and dissemination of findings.\n15 credits\n\n\nQualitative Research Design and Analysis\n\n\nOn completing the module students will be expected to be able to: understand a range of qualitative research approaches, data collection methods and forms of analysis; plan and undertake a simple analysis of student-generated qualitative data; critically appraise the methods and results of qualitative research.\n15 credits\n\n\nFoundations in Health Policy, Leadership and Management\n\n\nThis campus-based module, integrates the principles of health policy with the foundations in leadership and associated management of health care teams, services and systems, in the context of rapid changes and advances locally, nationally and internationally. There will be a particular focus on public health and health system issues throughout the module. \n\nA number of different cases will be used to illustrate the complexity of developing (or not) health policy and how related health and public health services are then managed and evaluated. Students will be supported in developing critical thinking about the relative effectiveness of different approaches to policy development and analysis. They will learn key approaches to leadership and management of health teams, services and systems, as well as gain an understanding of the complex interplay of the different actors in the health systems. They will acquire an appreciation of some of the key challenges and issues encountered in contemporary health service and health system management. Through exploration of these topics and critical analysis, students will develop know how to systematically assess,  as well as management and improvement by analysing several health care services within the broader cultural, commercial and political contexts. Over the course of the module students will work in small groups  to gain practical understanding of how to apply management and leadership theories and styles in different health care contexts, from health care teams to public health and health systems. \n15 credits\n\n\nPsychological and sociological approaches to health\n\n\nThere is increasing awareness amongst health professionals of the need to focus on social and psychosocial aspects of illness, as well as biomedical. This module provides an introduction to contemporary research in the field of health psychology covering both traditional mainstream approaches and newly emerging critical studies. It combines this with a sociological approach, studying how society is structured by looking at the patterns of relationships that have an existence over and above individuals and how this influences health and illness.  In this respect it looks at how health is distributed as a consequence of how people are related to each other in a number of ways.  This involves looking at how, for example, social class and gender relations result in varying patterns and experiences of health.\n\nTopics covered include: approaches within health psychology, for example understanding and changing health behaviour, the role of psychology in health and illness, and the application and relevance of contemporary work in global and cultural context.  The approach to sociology involves understanding how people share and shape understandings of what it means to be healthy or ill. We will explore how the meaning of health can shape encounters with various health professionals and how concepts of health and illness can shape and control the behaviour of different populations.\n15 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content of our courses is reviewed annually to make sure it's up-to-date and relevant.

This module will provide students with an understanding of the main approaches to, and methodologies for, conducting Health Needs Assessments and will equip them with an understanding of programme planning, and the monitoring and evaluation of programmes.\n15 credits\n\n\nIntroduction to Research Methods\n\n\nThis module is offered across several programmes. Learning activities for the module are tailored to your individual specialist areas to provide learning that is relevant and specific to your chosen degree programme.\n\n\n\nThis module provides students with an introduction to quantitative and qualitative research methods; it covers all stages of the research process from planning and design and research ethics and public and patient involvement, through to data collection and analysis and dissemination stages. It is specifically designed for students who do not have prior research experience and would be suitable for students from a range of backgrounds, but is particularly relevant to those interested in applied health related research. The course also provides a foundation for further learning in specific research methods.\n15 credits\n\n\nIntroduction to Statistics and Critical Appraisal\n\n\nThe unit introduces students to basic  concepts and techniques such as hypothesis testing and confidence interval estimation in statistics.  Students will learn some simple statistical methods and the principles behind some advanced methods such as regression.  It will equip students with the knowledge and skills necessary to understand and critically appraise statistics in research literature.The course is not aimed at 'doers' of statistics, that is, students who are going to design their own studies to collect and analyse their own data. It will not teach you how to analyse, present and report your own data.\n15 credits\n\n\nCritical Reflections in Global Health\n\n\nGlobal health has been described as the art and science of preventing disease, prolonging life, and promoting health through the organised efforts of society, with the goal being the attainment of biological, physical, and mental well-being of all members of society. In this module we take an inter-disciplinary approach to explore these themes.\n\nAligned with the themes of our key reader (7th edition of the Oxford Textbook of Global Public Health) we will consider some of the key concepts of global health, explore some of the determinants of health, and consider some of the key function / methods applied to address global health issues. We will then reflect on these themes in relation to the practice of global health through the lens of specific health challenges. Throughout the module themes such as inequalities in health, complexities in our response, and the political, social, and economic context within which we work will be repeatedly raised and discussed. \n\nIn delivering this module we are excited to have secured the expertise of regional, national, and international leaders and experts who will share their learnings on a diverse range of subjects that include socioeconomic and health inequalities, health intelligence, and sexual and reproductive health. In relation to the sharing of experiences and expertise, and in stimulating engaged discussion, throughout the module you will be encouraged to develop and use a reflective learning approach to consider shifts in your perception and understanding of the issues raised.\n15 credits\n\n\nEpidemiology\n\n\nEpidemiology is the discipline underpinning both effective public health practice and research into the causes, control and prevention of disease.  Knowledge and understanding of epidemiological concepts and methods is a basic requirement for effective public health practice. \n\nThis module will provide an introduction to epidemiology covering key epidemiological concepts; measures of disease; association and causation; confounding and bias.  It will also introduce research designs including cross-sectional, ecological, cohort, case-control and intervention studies and introduce population health measures such as screening.\n15 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Year two modules will vary depending on the specialisation and institution chosen, but you will complete your dissertation during this time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Optional modules:\n\n\nDisaster and Emergency Management\n\n\nDisasters and emergencies can strike any community.  It is not a question of whether a disaster will occur but when.  However, the likelihood, scale and impact of a disaster can be minimized through appropriate emergency planning, preparation and response by the community, governmental and non-governmental organisations.  This module will cover the key concepts of disaster and emergency management, explore some of the contemporary issues and develop students' knowledge and skills in this field.\n15 credits\n\n\nConfronting Public Health Problems\n\n\nScHARR is well known for its high-quality and impactful research. Engaging with the research process on relevant public health topics through problem-based learning will provide students with practical skills not just for future research but also transferable skills for other areas relating to public health, for example policy making and designing and implementing public health interventions. This module is offered as an optional module on the MPH, and it will complement the core modules in allowing students to concentrate on specific aspects of public health practice and research, and develop and advance transferable employability skills.\n15 credits\n\n\nFurther Statistics for Health Science Researchers\n\n\nThe unit covers fundamental statistical concepts, and both simple statistical methods and the more widely used advanced methods of multiple regression, survival analysis and generalised linear models. It will be a practical module, including the teaching of the statistical software SPSS, equipping students with the knowledge and skills necessary to design and analyse a study to answer specific research questions; to understand and critically appraise the literature; and to present research findings in a suitable fashion.\n15 credits\n\n\nCommunicable Disease Control\n\n\nHealth protection is one of the cornerstones of public health.  The control of communicable diseases is one of the major functions of health protection.  This module will cover the principles of surveillance, outbreak management, immunisation programmes, and prevention and control of infectious diseases.  It will also present a broad range of common infectious disease topics including HIV, tuberculosis, meningitis, diarrhoeal illnesses and hospital acquired infections.  This module would provide the essential foundations for students intending to undertake the Faculty of Public Health Part A/Diploma examination.\n15 credits\n\n\nEconomic Evaluation and Healthcare Financing\n\n\nThis module introduces the basic principles of economic evaluation as applied to healthcare interventions and health care financing. The core part of the course focuses on economic evaluation and covers the different types of evaluations that are available and the various stages and techniques that need to be applied to generate results. As alternative techniques are described, the strength and weakness of each will be highlighted, with the students being encouraged to critically appraise their appropriateness to different contexts. The course also introduces the concepts of markets and market failure, models of health care financing and objectives of health care systems. These topics draw on economic theory and use it to identify possible solutions to health system problems. Health system performance measurement will also be covered, linking the economic and health system content to empirical studies.\n15 credits\n\n\nHealth Promotion\n\n\nHealth Promotion enables people to take control over and improve their own health.  It builds on knowledge from behavioural science that individual behaviour and health are determined by the social, physical and economic environment.  This module will consider the nature of health promotion from a global perspective, the associated ideological dilemmas, current understanding of individual and group behaviours, methods of promoting health and the evaluation of health promotion.  The module will use the 5 key principles within the Ottawa Charter applied to health promotion as a framework.  Case studies will be used to give students practical examples of health promotion in different countries.\n15 credits\n\n\nPublic Health Informatics\n\n\nPublic Health Informatics is a module designed to look at how informatics and information technology can be used to help address some of the major issues in public health. Public health informatics was traditionally defined as the systematic application of information and computer science and technology to public health practice, research, and learning (Yasnoff, 2000). In this module, we examine this rapidly changing field, using a combination of lectures, individual and group exercises and self directed learning. Key issues around the local, national and international contributions that technology can make to public health are critically examined and students are given a theoretical and practical grounding in this increasingly important discipline.\n15 credits\n\n\nSystematic Reviews and Critical Appraisal Techniques\n\n\nTo familiarise students with principles of systematic reviews and critical appraisal and the acquisition of skills necessary to undertake such work.  The unit includes an introduction to information systems; principles of systematic literature reviews and critical appraisal; search strategies; computer-assisted search methods; practicalities of writing up the results of a systematic review; introduction to Meta- analysis; and dissemination of findings.\n15 credits\n\n\nQualitative Research Design and Analysis\n\n\nOn completing the module students will be expected to be able to: understand a range of qualitative research approaches, data collection methods and forms of analysis; plan and undertake a simple analysis of student-generated qualitative data; critically appraise the methods and results of qualitative research.\n15 credits\n\n\nFoundations in Health Policy, Leadership and Management\n\n\nThis campus-based module, integrates the principles of health policy with the foundations in leadership and associated management of health care teams, services and systems, in the context of rapid changes and advances locally, nationally and internationally. There will be a particular focus on public health and health system issues throughout the module. \n\nA number of different cases will be used to illustrate the complexity of developing (or not) health policy and how related health and public health services are then managed and evaluated. Students will be supported in developing critical thinking about the relative effectiveness of different approaches to policy development and analysis. They will learn key approaches to leadership and management of health teams, services and systems, as well as gain an understanding of the complex interplay of the different actors in the health systems. They will acquire an appreciation of some of the key challenges and issues encountered in contemporary health service and health system management. Through exploration of these topics and critical analysis, students will develop know how to systematically assess,  as well as management and improvement by analysing several health care services within the broader cultural, commercial and political contexts. Over the course of the module students will work in small groups  to gain practical understanding of how to apply management and leadership theories and styles in different health care contexts, from health care teams to public health and health systems. \n15 credits\n\n\nPsychological and sociological approaches to health\n\n\nThere is increasing awareness amongst health professionals of the need to focus on social and psychosocial aspects of illness, as well as biomedical. This module provides an introduction to contemporary research in the field of health psychology covering both traditional mainstream approaches and newly emerging critical studies. It combines this with a sociological approach, studying how society is structured by looking at the patterns of relationships that have an existence over and above individuals and how this influences health and illness.  In this respect it looks at how health is distributed as a consequence of how people are related to each other in a number of ways.  This involves looking at how, for example, social class and gender relations result in varying patterns and experiences of health.\n\nTopics covered include: approaches within health psychology, for example understanding and changing health behaviour, the role of psychology in health and illness, and the application and relevance of contemporary work in global and cultural context.  The approach to sociology involves understanding how people share and shape understandings of what it means to be healthy or ill. We will explore how the meaning of health can shape encounters with various health professionals and how concepts of health and illness can shape and control the behaviour of different populations.\n15 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content of our courses is reviewed annually to make sure it's up-to-date and relevant.

This module will provide students with an understanding of the main approaches to, and methodologies for, conducting Health Needs Assessments and will equip them with an understanding of programme planning, and the monitoring and evaluation of programmes.\n15 credits\n\n\nIntroduction to Research Methods\n\n\nThis module is offered across several programmes. Learning activities for the module are tailored to your individual specialist areas to provide learning that is relevant and specific to your chosen degree programme.\n\n\n\nThis module provides students with an introduction to quantitative and qualitative research methods; it covers all stages of the research process from planning and design and research ethics and public and patient involvement, through to data collection and analysis and dissemination stages. It is specifically designed for students who do not have prior research experience and would be suitable for students from a range of backgrounds, but is particularly relevant to those interested in applied health related research. The course also provides a foundation for further learning in specific research methods.\n15 credits\n\n\nIntroduction to Statistics and Critical Appraisal\n\n\nThe unit introduces students to basic  concepts and techniques such as hypothesis testing and confidence interval estimation in statistics.  Students will learn some simple statistical methods and the principles behind some advanced methods such as regression.  It will equip students with the knowledge and skills necessary to understand and critically appraise statistics in research literature.The course is not aimed at 'doers' of statistics, that is, students who are going to design their own studies to collect and analyse their own data. It will not teach you how to analyse, present and report your own data.\n15 credits\n\n\nCritical Reflections in Global Health\n\n\nGlobal health has been described as the art and science of preventing disease, prolonging life, and promoting health through the organised efforts of society, with the goal being the attainment of biological, physical, and mental well-being of all members of society. In this module we take an inter-disciplinary approach to explore these themes.\n\nAligned with the themes of our key reader (7th edition of the Oxford Textbook of Global Public Health) we will consider some of the key concepts of global health, explore some of the determinants of health, and consider some of the key function / methods applied to address global health issues. We will then reflect on these themes in relation to the practice of global health through the lens of specific health challenges. Throughout the module themes such as inequalities in health, complexities in our response, and the political, social, and economic context within which we work will be repeatedly raised and discussed. \n\nIn delivering this module we are excited to have secured the expertise of regional, national, and international leaders and experts who will share their learnings on a diverse range of subjects that include socioeconomic and health inequalities, health intelligence, and sexual and reproductive health. In relation to the sharing of experiences and expertise, and in stimulating engaged discussion, throughout the module you will be encouraged to develop and use a reflective learning approach to consider shifts in your perception and understanding of the issues raised.\n15 credits\n\n\nEpidemiology\n\n\nEpidemiology is the discipline underpinning both effective public health practice and research into the causes, control and prevention of disease.  Knowledge and understanding of epidemiological concepts and methods is a basic requirement for effective public health practice. \n\nThis module will provide an introduction to epidemiology covering key epidemiological concepts; measures of disease; association and causation; confounding and bias.  It will also introduce research designs including cross-sectional, ecological, cohort, case-control and intervention studies and introduce population health measures such as screening.\n15 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Year two modules will vary depending on the specialisation and institution chosen, but you will complete your dissertation during this time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Optional modules:\n\n\nDisaster and Emergency Management\n\n\nDisasters and emergencies can strike any community.  It is not a question of whether a disaster will occur but when.  However, the likelihood, scale and impact of a disaster can be minimized through appropriate emergency planning, preparation and response by the community, governmental and non-governmental organisations.  This module will cover the key concepts of disaster and emergency management, explore some of the contemporary issues and develop students' knowledge and skills in this field.\n15 credits\n\n\nConfronting Public Health Problems\n\n\nScHARR is well known for its high-quality and impactful research. Engaging with the research process on relevant public health topics through problem-based learning will provide students with practical skills not just for future research but also transferable skills for other areas relating to public health, for example policy making and designing and implementing public health interventions. This module is offered as an optional module on the MPH, and it will complement the core modules in allowing students to concentrate on specific aspects of public health practice and research, and develop and advance transferable employability skills.\n15 credits\n\n\nFurther Statistics for Health Science Researchers\n\n\nThe unit covers fundamental statistical concepts, and both simple statistical methods and the more widely used advanced methods of multiple regression, survival analysis and generalised linear models. It will be a practical module, including the teaching of the statistical software SPSS, equipping students with the knowledge and skills necessary to design and analyse a study to answer specific research questions; to understand and critically appraise the literature; and to present research findings in a suitable fashion.\n15 credits\n\n\nCommunicable Disease Control\n\n\nHealth protection is one of the cornerstones of public health.  The control of communicable diseases is one of the major functions of health protection.  This module will cover the principles of surveillance, outbreak management, immunisation programmes, and prevention and control of infectious diseases.  It will also present a broad range of common infectious disease topics including HIV, tuberculosis, meningitis, diarrhoeal illnesses and hospital acquired infections.  This module would provide the essential foundations for students intending to undertake the Faculty of Public Health Part A/Diploma examination.\n15 credits\n\n\nEconomic Evaluation and Healthcare Financing\n\n\nThis module introduces the basic principles of economic evaluation as applied to healthcare interventions and health care financing. The core part of the course focuses on economic evaluation and covers the different types of evaluations that are available and the various stages and techniques that need to be applied to generate results. As alternative techniques are described, the strength and weakness of each will be highlighted, with the students being encouraged to critically appraise their appropriateness to different contexts. The course also introduces the concepts of markets and market failure, models of health care financing and objectives of health care systems. These topics draw on economic theory and use it to identify possible solutions to health system problems. Health system performance measurement will also be covered, linking the economic and health system content to empirical studies.\n15 credits\n\n\nHealth Promotion\n\n\nHealth Promotion enables people to take control over and improve their own health.  It builds on knowledge from behavioural science that individual behaviour and health are determined by the social, physical and economic environment.  This module will consider the nature of health promotion from a global perspective, the associated ideological dilemmas, current understanding of individual and group behaviours, methods of promoting health and the evaluation of health promotion.  The module will use the 5 key principles within the Ottawa Charter applied to health promotion as a framework.  Case studies will be used to give students practical examples of health promotion in different countries.\n15 credits\n\n\nPublic Health Informatics\n\n\nPublic Health Informatics is a module designed to look at how informatics and information technology can be used to help address some of the major issues in public health. Public health informatics was traditionally defined as the systematic application of information and computer science and technology to public health practice, research, and learning (Yasnoff, 2000). In this module, we examine this rapidly changing field, using a combination of lectures, individual and group exercises and self directed learning. Key issues around the local, national and international contributions that technology can make to public health are critically examined and students are given a theoretical and practical grounding in this increasingly important discipline.\n15 credits\n\n\nSystematic Reviews and Critical Appraisal Techniques\n\n\nTo familiarise students with principles of systematic reviews and critical appraisal and the acquisition of skills necessary to undertake such work.  The unit includes an introduction to information systems; principles of systematic literature reviews and critical appraisal; search strategies; computer-assisted search methods; practicalities of writing up the results of a systematic review; introduction to Meta- analysis; and dissemination of findings.\n15 credits\n\n\nQualitative Research Design and Analysis\n\n\nOn completing the module students will be expected to be able to: understand a range of qualitative research approaches, data collection methods and forms of analysis; plan and undertake a simple analysis of student-generated qualitative data; critically appraise the methods and results of qualitative research.\n15 credits\n\n\nFoundations in Health Policy, Leadership and Management\n\n\nThis campus-based module, integrates the principles of health policy with the foundations in leadership and associated management of health care teams, services and systems, in the context of rapid changes and advances locally, nationally and internationally. There will be a particular focus on public health and health system issues throughout the module. \n\nA number of different cases will be used to illustrate the complexity of developing (or not) health policy and how related health and public health services are then managed and evaluated. Students will be supported in developing critical thinking about the relative effectiveness of different approaches to policy development and analysis. They will learn key approaches to leadership and management of health teams, services and systems, as well as gain an understanding of the complex interplay of the different actors in the health systems. They will acquire an appreciation of some of the key challenges and issues encountered in contemporary health service and health system management. Through exploration of these topics and critical analysis, students will develop know how to systematically assess,  as well as management and improvement by analysing several health care services within the broader cultural, commercial and political contexts. Over the course of the module students will work in small groups  to gain practical understanding of how to apply management and leadership theories and styles in different health care contexts, from health care teams to public health and health systems. \n15 credits\n\n\nPsychological and sociological approaches to health\n\n\nThere is increasing awareness amongst health professionals of the need to focus on social and psychosocial aspects of illness, as well as biomedical. This module provides an introduction to contemporary research in the field of health psychology covering both traditional mainstream approaches and newly emerging critical studies. It combines this with a sociological approach, studying how society is structured by looking at the patterns of relationships that have an existence over and above individuals and how this influences health and illness.  In this respect it looks at how health is distributed as a consequence of how people are related to each other in a number of ways.  This involves looking at how, for example, social class and gender relations result in varying patterns and experiences of health.\n\nTopics covered include: approaches within health psychology, for example understanding and changing health behaviour, the role of psychology in health and illness, and the application and relevance of contemporary work in global and cultural context.  The approach to sociology involves understanding how people share and shape understandings of what it means to be healthy or ill. We will explore how the meaning of health can shape encounters with various health professionals and how concepts of health and illness can shape and control the behaviour of different populations.\n15 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content of our courses is reviewed annually to make sure it's up-to-date and relevant.

This module will provide students with an understanding of the main approaches to, and methodologies for, conducting Health Needs Assessments and will equip them with an understanding of programme planning, and the monitoring and evaluation of programmes.\n15 credits\n\n\nIntroduction to Research Methods\n\n\nThis module is offered across several programmes. Learning activities for the module are tailored to your individual specialist areas to provide learning that is relevant and specific to your chosen degree programme.\n\n\n\nThis module provides students with an introduction to quantitative and qualitative research methods; it covers all stages of the research process from planning and design and research ethics and public and patient involvement, through to data collection and analysis and dissemination stages. It is specifically designed for students who do not have prior research experience and would be suitable for students from a range of backgrounds, but is particularly relevant to those interested in applied health related research. The course also provides a foundation for further learning in specific research methods.\n15 credits\n\n\nIntroduction to Statistics and Critical Appraisal\n\n\nThe unit introduces students to basic  concepts and techniques such as hypothesis testing and confidence interval estimation in statistics.  Students will learn some simple statistical methods and the principles behind some advanced methods such as regression.  It will equip students with the knowledge and skills necessary to understand and critically appraise statistics in research literature.The course is not aimed at 'doers' of statistics, that is, students who are going to design their own studies to collect and analyse their own data. It will not teach you how to analyse, present and report your own data.\n15 credits\n\n\nCritical Reflections in Global Health\n\n\nGlobal health has been described as the art and science of preventing disease, prolonging life, and promoting health through the organised efforts of society, with the goal being the attainment of biological, physical, and mental well-being of all members of society. In this module we take an inter-disciplinary approach to explore these themes.\n\nAligned with the themes of our key reader (7th edition of the Oxford Textbook of Global Public Health) we will consider some of the key concepts of global health, explore some of the determinants of health, and consider some of the key function / methods applied to address global health issues. We will then reflect on these themes in relation to the practice of global health through the lens of specific health challenges. Throughout the module themes such as inequalities in health, complexities in our response, and the political, social, and economic context within which we work will be repeatedly raised and discussed. \n\nIn delivering this module we are excited to have secured the expertise of regional, national, and international leaders and experts who will share their learnings on a diverse range of subjects that include socioeconomic and health inequalities, health intelligence, and sexual and reproductive health. In relation to the sharing of experiences and expertise, and in stimulating engaged discussion, throughout the module you will be encouraged to develop and use a reflective learning approach to consider shifts in your perception and understanding of the issues raised.\n15 credits\n\n\nEpidemiology\n\n\nEpidemiology is the discipline underpinning both effective public health practice and research into the causes, control and prevention of disease.  Knowledge and understanding of epidemiological concepts and methods is a basic requirement for effective public health practice. \n\nThis module will provide an introduction to epidemiology covering key epidemiological concepts; measures of disease; association and causation; confounding and bias.  It will also introduce research designs including cross-sectional, ecological, cohort, case-control and intervention studies and introduce population health measures such as screening.\n15 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Year two modules will vary depending on the specialisation and institution chosen, but you will complete your dissertation during this time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Optional modules:\n\n\nDisaster and Emergency Management\n\n\nDisasters and emergencies can strike any community.  It is not a question of whether a disaster will occur but when.  However, the likelihood, scale and impact of a disaster can be minimized through appropriate emergency planning, preparation and response by the community, governmental and non-governmental organisations.  This module will cover the key concepts of disaster and emergency management, explore some of the contemporary issues and develop students' knowledge and skills in this field.\n15 credits\n\n\nConfronting Public Health Problems\n\n\nScHARR is well known for its high-quality and impactful research. Engaging with the research process on relevant public health topics through problem-based learning will provide students with practical skills not just for future research but also transferable skills for other areas relating to public health, for example policy making and designing and implementing public health interventions. This module is offered as an optional module on the MPH, and it will complement the core modules in allowing students to concentrate on specific aspects of public health practice and research, and develop and advance transferable employability skills.\n15 credits\n\n\nFurther Statistics for Health Science Researchers\n\n\nThe unit covers fundamental statistical concepts, and both simple statistical methods and the more widely used advanced methods of multiple regression, survival analysis and generalised linear models. It will be a practical module, including the teaching of the statistical software SPSS, equipping students with the knowledge and skills necessary to design and analyse a study to answer specific research questions; to understand and critically appraise the literature; and to present research findings in a suitable fashion.\n15 credits\n\n\nCommunicable Disease Control\n\n\nHealth protection is one of the cornerstones of public health.  The control of communicable diseases is one of the major functions of health protection.  This module will cover the principles of surveillance, outbreak management, immunisation programmes, and prevention and control of infectious diseases.  It will also present a broad range of common infectious disease topics including HIV, tuberculosis, meningitis, diarrhoeal illnesses and hospital acquired infections.  This module would provide the essential foundations for students intending to undertake the Faculty of Public Health Part A/Diploma examination.\n15 credits\n\n\nEconomic Evaluation and Healthcare Financing\n\n\nThis module introduces the basic principles of economic evaluation as applied to healthcare interventions and health care financing. The core part of the course focuses on economic evaluation and covers the different types of evaluations that are available and the various stages and techniques that need to be applied to generate results. As alternative techniques are described, the strength and weakness of each will be highlighted, with the students being encouraged to critically appraise their appropriateness to different contexts. The course also introduces the concepts of markets and market failure, models of health care financing and objectives of health care systems. These topics draw on economic theory and use it to identify possible solutions to health system problems. Health system performance measurement will also be covered, linking the economic and health system content to empirical studies.\n15 credits\n\n\nHealth Promotion\n\n\nHealth Promotion enables people to take control over and improve their own health.  It builds on knowledge from behavioural science that individual behaviour and health are determined by the social, physical and economic environment.  This module will consider the nature of health promotion from a global perspective, the associated ideological dilemmas, current understanding of individual and group behaviours, methods of promoting health and the evaluation of health promotion.  The module will use the 5 key principles within the Ottawa Charter applied to health promotion as a framework.  Case studies will be used to give students practical examples of health promotion in different countries.\n15 credits\n\n\nPublic Health Informatics\n\n\nPublic Health Informatics is a module designed to look at how informatics and information technology can be used to help address some of the major issues in public health. Public health informatics was traditionally defined as the systematic application of information and computer science and technology to public health practice, research, and learning (Yasnoff, 2000). In this module, we examine this rapidly changing field, using a combination of lectures, individual and group exercises and self directed learning. Key issues around the local, national and international contributions that technology can make to public health are critically examined and students are given a theoretical and practical grounding in this increasingly important discipline.\n15 credits\n\n\nSystematic Reviews and Critical Appraisal Techniques\n\n\nTo familiarise students with principles of systematic reviews and critical appraisal and the acquisition of skills necessary to undertake such work.  The unit includes an introduction to information systems; principles of systematic literature reviews and critical appraisal; search strategies; computer-assisted search methods; practicalities of writing up the results of a systematic review; introduction to Meta- analysis; and dissemination of findings.\n15 credits\n\n\nQualitative Research Design and Analysis\n\n\nOn completing the module students will be expected to be able to: understand a range of qualitative research approaches, data collection methods and forms of analysis; plan and undertake a simple analysis of student-generated qualitative data; critically appraise the methods and results of qualitative research.\n15 credits\n\n\nFoundations in Health Policy, Leadership and Management\n\n\nThis campus-based module, integrates the principles of health policy with the foundations in leadership and associated management of health care teams, services and systems, in the context of rapid changes and advances locally, nationally and internationally. There will be a particular focus on public health and health system issues throughout the module. \n\nA number of different cases will be used to illustrate the complexity of developing (or not) health policy and how related health and public health services are then managed and evaluated. Students will be supported in developing critical thinking about the relative effectiveness of different approaches to policy development and analysis. They will learn key approaches to leadership and management of health teams, services and systems, as well as gain an understanding of the complex interplay of the different actors in the health systems. They will acquire an appreciation of some of the key challenges and issues encountered in contemporary health service and health system management. Through exploration of these topics and critical analysis, students will develop know how to systematically assess,  as well as management and improvement by analysing several health care services within the broader cultural, commercial and political contexts. Over the course of the module students will work in small groups  to gain practical understanding of how to apply management and leadership theories and styles in different health care contexts, from health care teams to public health and health systems. \n15 credits\n\n\nPsychological and sociological approaches to health\n\n\nThere is increasing awareness amongst health professionals of the need to focus on social and psychosocial aspects of illness, as well as biomedical. This module provides an introduction to contemporary research in the field of health psychology covering both traditional mainstream approaches and newly emerging critical studies. It combines this with a sociological approach, studying how society is structured by looking at the patterns of relationships that have an existence over and above individuals and how this influences health and illness.  In this respect it looks at how health is distributed as a consequence of how people are related to each other in a number of ways.  This involves looking at how, for example, social class and gender relations result in varying patterns and experiences of health.\n\nTopics covered include: approaches within health psychology, for example understanding and changing health behaviour, the role of psychology in health and illness, and the application and relevance of contemporary work in global and cultural context.  The approach to sociology involves understanding how people share and shape understandings of what it means to be healthy or ill. We will explore how the meaning of health can shape encounters with various health professionals and how concepts of health and illness can shape and control the behaviour of different populations.\n15 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content of our courses is reviewed annually to make sure it's up-to-date and relevant. Individual modules are occasionally updated or withdrawn. This is in response to discoveries through our world-leading research; funding changes; professional accreditation requirements; student or employer feedback; outcomes of reviews; and variations in staff or student numbers.

When this is ready we'll send you an email containing your applicant and choice numbers. You should normally receive this email within two working days. We'll then send your application for academic consideration.\nYou can check the progress of your application at any time simply by logging back into your online application.\nIf we need to contact you we'll do so by email, so please make sure that you check the email account you used for your application, and that this account is set to trust messages coming from @shef.ac.uk and @sheffield.ac.uk addresses. You may wish to add admissions@sheffield.ac.uk to your address book to avoid important messages being marked as spam.\nIf you change your email address, please let us know by emailing us at admissions@sheffield.ac.uk, including your full name and applicant number.\nIt normally takes academic departments around six weeks to make decisions on research applications. It can take longer at busy times.\nIf you haven't received a decision on your application after eight weeks, we recommend that you contact the academic department directly. You can find their contact details via our find a PhD webpage.\nBefore we make our decision, we may invite you to attend an interview with staff from your academic department. You can find information on what to expect in an interview in our guidance:\nWhen we've made our decision, it will appear in your online application, and we'll also send you an email to confirm this.\nIf we've offered you a study place, we'll provide you with an official electronic offer letter detailing any conditions and the amount payable for the tuition fees. The offer letter will be attached to our email and also available for you to download from your online application.\nIf we haven't offered you a study place and you would like feedback on this decision, you should contact the academic department directly in writing.\nIf we make you an offer, it will be either Conditional or Unconditional.\nA Conditional offer means there are requirements that you need to meet before you can start the course, for example a certain English language score, or a minimum grade in your current studies.\nAn Unconditional offer means there are no further academic requirements that you need to meet.\nIf we've made you a Conditional offer, the conditions will be stated in your offer letter. When you've met these conditions, you should upload to your online application documents that prove it. When you've met all the conditions of your offer, we'll provide you with a new, Unconditional offer letter.\nThe standard deadlines for meeting the conditions of an offer are provided on our key dates and deadlines page.\nIf you have any problems attaching documents to your online application, please contact us.\nWe normally determine the final mark of an international degree by calculating the average of all the module marks, weighted by credit value. For module marks assigned as a range, we use the mid-point of the range. Note that the average we calculate may differ from the average shown on your transcript.\nAn Unconditional offer has no conditions. You just need to let us know whether or not you want to accept or decline our offer of a study place.\nIn most cases, you can accept or decline the offer of a study place via your online application. If you're not able to do this, please let us know your decision by emailing us at admissions@sheffield.ac.uk. When you accept an offer, you also accept our Terms and Conditions upon Acceptance of an Offer.\nExcept where indicated in the offer letter, there are no specific deadlines for accepting an offer. However, we encourage applicants to make a decision within three months of receiving an offer. Also, the sooner you accept an offer, the sooner you'll be able to make other arrangements (for example your accommodation or visa).\nYou can accept only one Unconditional offer of a place. If you've received Unconditional offers for more than one course, you'll need to choose which course to accept. You should then decline the other offers.\nIf you want to withdraw from the application process, please contact us. We'll then update your application record.\nIf we've offered you a study place and for unforeseen circumstances you can't attend at the start of your course, you can ask to defer your entry.\nYou can request a deferral through your original online application, by clicking on the 'Request Deferral' link in the 'Your Applications' section. Your request will be forwarded to the academic selectors for a decision. A change of start date is at the discretion of the University.

For students from England, the agency is Student Finance England.\nWhether you qualify for a postgraduate doctoral loan depends on your course, your age, and your nationality or residency status.\nYou will not be able to get a postgraduate doctoral loan if you already have a doctoral degree, or a qualification that’s equivalent or higher. You will also not be able to get a postgraduate doctoral loan if you’ve received or will receive Research Council funding (for example, studentships, stipends, scholarships and tuition fee support).\nThere are additional criteria that may mean you are not eligible for a postgraduate doctoral loan. For more information about eligibility, please refer to the government website.\nGov.uk - Doctoral loan - Eligibility\nYour course must be a full, standalone doctoral course, have started on or after 1 August 2018, last between 3 to 8 academic years, and be provided by a university in the UK with research degree awarding powers.\nIt can be full-time or part-time and taught or research-based (or a combination of both).\nYou can apply for a loan if your doctoral programme includes an integrated master’s degree (even if you already have a master’s degree).

If you are starting your course in the academic year 2025-2026, you can borrow up to £30,301.\nA lower amount of loan is available if you are already registered on a course:\nYou can apply for a postgraduate doctoral loan in any year of your course but if you apply after your first year, you might not get the maximum amount.\nFor more information on what you’ll get, please refer to the government website.\nGov.uk - Doctoral loan - What you’ll get\nThe loan will be divided equally across each year of your course. The loan will be paid directly to you.\nAfter your application has been approved, you’ll be sent a letter with your payment dates. You can also check them in your online account. The loan will be paid directly to you in three instalments of 33%, 33% and 34% each year. You get the first payment after your course start date, once the University confirms that you’ve registered.\nApplications usually open in the May or June before you start your course.\nYou only need to apply once for a postgraduate doctoral loan for your course.\nYou need to apply within 9 months of the first day of the last academic year of the course.\nFor more information, please refer to the government website.\nGov.uk - Doctoral loan - How to apply\nLoan repayments will usually commence from the April after course completion at the earliest (or the April 4 years after the course started if you’re studying part-time and your course is longer than 4 years) and only when your income is over the repayment threshold set by the government: this is currently £21,000 a year for postgraduate loan repayment plans.\nGov.uk - Repaying your student loan - When you start repaying\nYour repayments will be taken out of your salary at the same time as tax and National Insurance if you’re an employee. Your payslips will show how much has been deducted. If you're self-employed, you'll pay through HM Revenue and Customs.\nGov.uk - Repaying your student loan - How to repay\nHow much you repay depends on your income. You’ll repay a percentage of your income over the repayment threshold set by the government (currently £21,000 for postgraduate loan repayment plans).\nThe doctoral loan repayment will be calculated at 6% of income above the repayment threshold.\nRepayments will be made concurrently alongside repayment of any outstanding undergraduate student loan.\nYour repayments are based on what you earn, not what you owe. If your wages drop, this is reflected in your repayments. For more information, please refer to the government website.\nGov.uk - Repaying your student loan - How much you repay\nYou can choose to make extra repayments towards your student loan. For more information, please refer to the government website.\nGov.uk - Repaying your student loan - Make extra repayments\nYour postgraduate doctoral loan will be written off 30 years after the April you were first due to repay.\nThe loan's interest rate will usually be calculated at the Retail Price Index (RPI) plus 3%. This interest will accrue from the date the first loan instalment is paid.\nFor more information about how the interest is calculated, please refer to the government website.\nGov.uk - How interest is calculated - Postgraduate loan\nAs a reminder, the information on this page relates to Student Finance England.\nStudents from Wales can find out more information online:\nWales - Student Finance Wales - Disabled Students' Allowance\nIf you have a disability or specific learning difficulty, such as dyslexia, you can apply for Disabled Students’ Allowance (DSA).\nThis can be on its own or in addition to any student finance you get, though you must at least be eligible to receive student finance.\nThe type of support and how much you get depends on your individual needs - not your household income. For part-time students, your ‘course intensity’ can affect how much DSA you get (‘course intensity’ means how long your course takes to complete each year compared to an equivalent full-time course).\nGov.uk - Disabled Students’ Allowance\nPostgraduate students will need to fill in a form.

You get the first payment after your course start date, once the University confirms that you’ve registered. \n\nHow to apply\nApplications usually open in the May or June before you start your course. \nYou only need to apply once for a postgraduate doctoral loan for your course.\nYou need to apply within 9 months of the first day of the last academic year of the course.\nFor more information, please refer to the government website.\nGov.uk - Doctoral loan - How to apply\n\nPaying back your loan\nWhen do I pay back my loan?\nLoan repayments will usually commence from the April after course completion at the earliest (or the April 4 years after the course started if you’re studying part-time and your course is longer than 4 years) and only when your income is over the repayment threshold set by the government: this is currently £21,000 a year for postgraduate loan repayment plans. \nFor more information, please refer to the government website.\nGov.uk - Repaying your student loan - When you start repaying\nHow do I pay back my loan?\nYour repayments will be taken out of your salary at the same time as tax and National Insurance if you’re an employee. Your payslips will show how much has been deducted. If you're self-employed, you'll pay through HM Revenue and Customs.\nFor more information, please refer to the government website.\nGov.uk - Repaying your student loan - How to repay\nHow much will I pay?\nHow much you repay depends on your income. You’ll repay a percentage of your income over the repayment threshold set by the government (currently £21,000 for postgraduate loan repayment plans).\nThe doctoral loan repayment will be calculated at 6% of income above the repayment threshold.\nRepayments will be made concurrently alongside repayment of any outstanding undergraduate student loan.\nYour repayments are based on what you earn, not what you owe. If your wages drop, this is reflected in your repayments. For more information, please refer to the government website.\nGov.uk - Repaying your student loan - How much you repay\nYou can choose to make extra repayments towards your student loan. For more information, please refer to the government website.\nGov.uk - Repaying your student loan - Make extra repayments\nYour postgraduate doctoral loan will be written off 30 years after the April you were first due to repay.\nWhat about interest?\nThe loan's interest rate will usually be calculated at the Retail Price Index (RPI) plus 3%. This interest will accrue from the date the first loan instalment is paid.\nFor more information about how the interest is calculated, please refer to the government website.\nGov.uk - How interest is calculated - Postgraduate loan\n\nSupport for students with a disability\n\n\nAs a reminder, the information on this page relates to Student Finance England. \nStudents from Wales can find out more information online:\nWales - Student Finance Wales - Disabled Students' Allowance\n\n\nIf you have a disability or specific learning difficulty, such as dyslexia, you can apply for Disabled Students’ Allowance (DSA).\nThis can be on its own or in addition to any student finance you get, though you must at least be eligible to receive student finance.\nThe type of support and how much you get depends on your individual needs - not your household income. For part-time students, your ‘course intensity’ can affect how much DSA you get (‘course intensity’ means how long your course takes to complete each year compared to an equivalent full-time course).\nGov.uk - Disabled Students’ Allowance\nPostgraduate students will need to fill in a form. Find out more information on the government website.\nGov.uk - Disabled Students’ Allowance - How to apply\nMore information about the support available for disabled students at the University of Sheffield can be found on the Disability and Dyslexia Support Service (DDSS) web pages.\nDisability and Dyslexia Support Service (DDSS)\n\nAdditional information\nFor more information about paying your tuition fees as a postgraduate research student using a doctoral loan, refer to our web pages.\nTuition fees for postgraduate research home students\nGuidance about additional funding and how to manage your money can be found on our web pages.\nLiving costs\nAdditional funding for postgraduate study\nIf you need to discuss your financial situation with someone, you can contact the Student Advice Centre in the Students' Union (both prospective students with an offer and current students). \nStudent Advice Centre\nThey have also provided some useful money management information online, available to all.\nStudent Advice Centre - Money Management\nIf you are a prospective student and have any other general enquiries, find out more about how you can contact us.\n\n\n\nContact us about fees and fundingWe're here to help.If it's urgent or you can't find answers, call +44 114 222 9754We're available from 10am until 4pm, Monday to Friday.

You may wish to add admissions@sheffield.ac.uk to your address book to avoid important messages being marked as spam.\nIf you change your email address, please let us know by emailing us at admissions@sheffield.ac.uk, including your full name and applicant number.\nFor most taught courses, it normally takes academic departments around four weeks to make decisions on applications. It can take longer at busy times.\nFor some of our courses, we may invite you to attend an interview with staff from your academic department. You can find information on what to expect in an interview in our guidance:\nWhen we've made our decision, it will appear in your online application, and we'll also send you an email to confirm this.\nIf we've offered you a study place, we'll provide you with an official electronic offer letter detailing any conditions and the amount payable for the tuition fees. The offer letter will be attached to our email and also available for you to download from your online application.\nIf we haven't offered you a study place and you would like feedback on this decision, you should contact the academic department directly in writing. You can find their contact details under the relevant entry in our postgraduate taught course listings.\nIf we make you an offer, it will be either Conditional or Unconditional.\nA Conditional offer means that there are requirements that you need to meet before you can start the course, for example a certain English language score, or a minimum grade in your current studies.\nAn Unconditional offer means that there are no further academic requirements that you need to meet.\nIf we've made you a Conditional offer, the conditions will be stated in your offer letter. When you've met these conditions, you should upload to your online application documents that prove it. When you've met all the conditions of your offer, we'll provide you with a new, Unconditional offer letter.\nThe standard deadlines for meeting the conditions of your offer are provided on our key dates and deadlines page. A few courses use different deadlines. If this is the case for your course, it will be indicated in your offer letter.\nIf you have any problems attaching documents to your online application, please contact us.\nWe normally determine the final mark of an international degree by calculating the average of all the module marks, weighted by credit value. For module marks assigned as a range, we use the mid-point of the range. Note that the average we calculate may differ from the average shown on your transcript.\nAn Unconditional offer has no conditions. You just need to let us know whether or not you want to accept or decline our offer of a study place.\nIn most cases, you can accept or decline the offer of a study place via your online application. If you're not able to do this, please let us know your decision by emailing us at admissions@sheffield.ac.uk. When you accept an offer, you also accept our Terms and Conditions upon Acceptance of an Offer.\nExcept where indicated in the offer letter, there are no specific deadlines for accepting an offer. However, we encourage applicants to make a decision within three months of receiving an offer. Also, the sooner you accept an offer, the sooner you'll be able to make other arrangements (for example your accommodation or visa).\nYou can accept only one Unconditional offer of a place. If you've received Unconditional offers for more than one course, you'll need to choose which course to accept. You should then decline the other offers.\nIf you're an International applicant, we'll normally ask you to pay a deposit on your tuition fee after you accept an Unconditional offer. We'll tell you more about this, including how you can pay, in your Unconditional offer letter.\nTuition fee deposits\nIf you want to withdraw from the application process, please contact us. We'll then update your application record.\nIf we've offered you a study place and you will be unable to attend at the start of your course, you may be able to defer your entry to the next admission point. Most postgraduate taught courses have one admission per year, at the start of the autumn semester in September/October.\nFor most courses, you can request a deferral through your original online application by clicking on the 'Request Deferral' link in the 'Your Applications' section. Requesting a deferral will deactivate your current offer, so you should only request one when you're sure that you can't start on the original start date. If you aren't sure, we would advise you to submit a new application for the next admission point, when applications open for that year.\nIf the academic selectors approve your request, we'll send you an amended offer letter with a deferred start date.\nYou should submit your deferral request by the deadline published on our key dates webpage. You can defer your application a maximum of two times. If want to defer for a third time, we'll ask you to re-apply.\nDeferral requests are reviewed by our admissions selectors, then we'll let you know the decision. Please note that we can't always review deferral requests when we receive them, and we can't issue deferred offers until after the new admissions year has begun, usually in September. We'll acknowledge receipt of your request within two weeks.\nUniversity of Sheffield offer-holders are entitled to access the members area of our website, MUSE (My University of Sheffield Environment). Using MUSE is the easiest way to book to attend departmental open days, apply for University accommodation and scholarships and, when the time comes, complete pre-registration tasks.\nAfter we've issued your offer, we'll email you with a username and invite you to activate your account. More information is available on our webpages:\nMUSE for offer-holders\nWhen you have accepted your Conditional or Unconditional offer, you can apply online for University accommodation. You can find more information, and view the full range of accommodation available for postgraduates, on our webpages:\nAccommodation\nIf you'll need a visa to study in the UK, you can find more information about when and how we'll arrange your CAS on our CAS Application webpages:\nCAS application\nThis page also includes links to further information about the visa application process.\nIf your offer letter says you'll require ATAS clearance to study on your course, you can find more information on our ATAS webpages:\nAcademic Technology Approval Scheme (ATAS).\nIf you've accepted your Unconditional offer, we'll email you with pre-registration information about four weeks before the start date of your course. You can also access pre-registration tasks via your MUSE account.\nIf you have not received your pre-registration email by three weeks before your course starts, please contact preregistration@sheffield.ac.uk.\nStart a conversation with us\nA masters from Sheffield means in-depth knowledge, advanced skills and the confidence to achieve your ambitions.\n[GRID_TABLE]\nAfter you apply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n                  On\n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\nAcknowledging your applicationAfter we receive your application, we'll create an applicant record for you.

For module marks assigned as a range, we use the mid-point of the range. Note that the average we calculate may differ from the average shown on your transcript.Unconditional offersAn Unconditional offer has no conditions. You just need to let us know whether or not you want to accept or decline our offer of a study place.Replying to your offerIn most cases, you can accept or decline the offer of a study place via your online application. If you're not able to do this, please let us know your decision by emailing us at admissions@sheffield.ac.uk. When you accept an offer, you also accept our Terms and Conditions upon Acceptance of an Offer.Except where indicated in the offer letter, there are no specific deadlines for accepting an offer. However, we encourage applicants to make a decision within three months of receiving an offer. Also, the sooner you accept an offer, the sooner you'll be able to make other arrangements (for example your accommodation or visa).You can accept only one Unconditional offer of a place.
