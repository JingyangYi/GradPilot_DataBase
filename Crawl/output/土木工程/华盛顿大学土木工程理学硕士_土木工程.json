A number of resources are available to help graduate students fund college, from financial aid to research assistantships to various fellowships.\nPh.D. students are fully funded with research or teaching assistantships, departmental support, and fellowships from a variety of organizations, such as the National Science Foundation, Achievement Rewards for College Scientists, and many more.\nFunding for the master’s degree program depends on whether students pursue the Professional Master's Program or research track. Professional Master's Program students are self-funded while the majority of research track students are fully funded with research assistantships or fellowships.\nProfessional Master's Program students are self-funded. The cost per-credit is the same for Washington state residents and non-residents, including international students. Below is information about tuition rates for the 2024-2025 academic year.\nThe majority of students in the research track master’s program are fully funded through fellowships and research and teaching assistantships.\nFull-time Ph.D. students and many research track master’s students are funded through research assistantships and teaching assistantships. For master’s students, priority is given to students who plan to continue on to a Ph.D. degree. Research and teaching assistants receive a monthly salary and tuition waiver as well as medical and dental insurance. The student is responsible for student fees.\nResearch assistantships: The number of research assistantships awarded varies depending on the status of research grants in the department. Some interest areas hire research assistants at the master’s level, while others typically only fund Ph.D. students. Students hired as a research assistant conduct research under the supervision of a faculty member, who is the principal investigator on the grant. Duties vary depending on the nature of the project, but require about 20 hours per week of service.\nIf you are interested in working as a research assistant, explore the faculty pages to learn about research in your interest area.\nTeaching assistantships: Funding in the form of a teaching assistantship is highly competitive and awarded to the most outstanding applicants. Typically, only the Structural Engineering group awards Teaching Assistantships to incoming students. Duties vary from course to course, but include conducting laboratory sessions, holding office hours for students and grading homework and exams. Teaching assistantships require about 20 hours per week of service.\nFunding for research and teaching assistantships is limited and competitive. Awards are made on a competitive basis by departmental faculty in each research area. To be considered for funding, answer “yes” on the financial aid section of the Graduate School’s online application. In your statement of purpose, which will be included in your application materials, please specify if you would like to be considered for a research or teaching assistantship.\nA variety of fellowships are available for graduate students interested in research. Below are a few to consider:\n• $732.00 per credit; 42 credits required\n• $30,744.00 total, plus student fees/quarter\n• PacTrans Fellowship Program\n• Valle Fellowship Program\n• National Science Foundation Fellowships\n• UW Graduate School Fellowship Information and List of Fellowships\n• Graduate Funding Information Service (UW Libraries)",

The MSCE degree can increase competitiveness in the job market, advance an existing career, or serve as a gateway to a Ph.D. degree. Master’s degree students include recent undergraduates who seek a specialized focus, engineers who want to advance their career and people from other backgrounds who are looking for a new and rewarding career.\nThe master’s program offers two degree options, depending on whether students want to pursue research prior to doctorate studies or professional practice. All master’s students receive a Master of Science in Civil Engineering degree regardless of which track they pursue.\nProfessional Master’s Program (PMP): This coursework-based option is for students who would like to hone their expertise before entering the workforce, as well as experienced professionals who desire job advancement. Students pursuing this degree are not expected to complete a thesis. Depending on the focus area, students can select from in-person or online courses or a combination.\nResearch-intensive academic track: This option is for students who plan to pursue Ph.D. studies or who are interested in participating in research prior to professional practice. The majority of students who pursue the research track are fully funded with research assistantships or fellowships. If your application is competitive, but funding is not available for research track admittance, your application will be considered for the Professional Master’s Program. Learn more about graduate student research.\nUW CEE offers master's degree programs in six specialty areas. Depending on the specialty area, students can select from in-person or online courses or a combination.\nIn partnership with the College of Environment, the College of Engineering, the eScience Institute, EarthLab and the Freshwater Initiative at UW, CEE is excited to offer a unique training and mentorship program called The Future Rivers NSF Research and Training Program (Future Rivers NRT). Interested graduate applicants should apply to both the graduate program (M.S. or Ph.D.) and to the Future Rivers NRT where they may be selected for financial support. Applicants should mention if they intend to apply to the Future Rivers NRT with a brief description of why in the CEE application material.
