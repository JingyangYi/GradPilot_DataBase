In addition to developing a close relationship with my professors, Course 1 stimulates me to think outside the box and to apply myself to real world problems. ”\n[HEADING] Our faculty make every effort to get to know students as people and learn about what makes them tick. The professors know you by name, and ask how your weekend or break was when they pass you in the hallway, even years after taking their class. Our classes encourage us to work in teams and groups, some of which have fostered my best friendships at MIT. We’re a friendly, happy major that supports each other both in and out of the classroom ”\n[HEADING] My favorite thing about being a MIT CEE grad student is being able to collaborate, network, and develop friendships with some of the smartest, driven, talented, and creative individuals. It really is a special feeling to be surrounded by people all with different groundbreaking ideas, passions, or goals. ”\n[HEADING] I wanted to find solutions for the future, ensuring that the infrastructure we build today is sustainable and long lasting. This program offered the perfect combination to improve my technical skills and focus on sustainability. ”\n[HEADING] It feels like someone in CEE touches every corner of climate change, from atmospheric chemistry to transportation systems and everything in between.

A scanned copy of your transcripts uploaded to the online system is sufficient.\nWe will ask all admitted applicants for an official transcript. Any discrepancies between the transcripts in your application and the hard copies may result in a candidate’s rejection or withdrawal of our admission offer.\nGMAT or GRE scores\nStandardized tests, specifically the GMAT (Focus Edition and 10th Edition) and GRE are a critical component of the application process and play an important role in our holistic evaluation process. The Admissions Committee expects that you will submit a GMAT (Focus Edition and 10th Edition) or GRE score to be reviewed as part of your application. Both the remote and in-person versions of these exams are accepted with no preference. \nWe will accept self-reported test scores by the application deadline, and welcome either the traditional or online version of exams. Test scores must be valid by the application deadline. Official scores should also be sent using the following school codes:\n\nTo share your GMAT score, please enter Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) – MIT Sloan School of Management\nTo share your GRE score, please use the MIT Sloan GRE School Code: 3791\n\nWhen you send your official scores, please review MIT Sloan’s directions for more information.\nResume\nUpload a business resume that lists your employment history, educational record, and any other appropriate information. We recommend you follow the general rules and guidelines for an American-style resume: ideally no more than one page long and in reverse chronological order.\nCover Letter\nMIT LGO seeks students whose personal characteristics demonstrate that they will make the most of the incredible opportunities at MIT, both academic and non-academic. We seek thoughtful leaders with exceptional intellectual abilities and the drive and determination to put their stamp on the world. We welcome people who are independent, authentic, and fearlessly creative — true doers. We want people who can redefine solutions to conventional problems, and strive to preempt unconventional dilemmas with cutting-edge ideas.\nTaking the above into consideration, please submit a cover letter seeking a place in the MIT LGO Program. Your letter should conform to a standard business correspondence, include one or more examples that illustrate why you meet the desired criteria above, and be addressed to Dr. Thomas Roemer, Executive Director of the LGO program. (300 words or fewer, excluding address and salutation).\nStatement of Purpose\nWrite a short description outlining why you would like to enroll in the engineering department you chose. Feel free to explain your academic/research interests, career goals, and why the department’s relationship with LGO fits you. We ask that you to keep your statement to 300 words.\nVideo Question 1\nPlease introduce yourself to your future classmates via a brief video statement. You will upload your video file to the application system and will receive detailed instructions on how to record your statement in the application. It’s fine to record this 60-second video at your desk or table at home. We’re looking for how you present yourself, not for your video editing skills. A head shot from the shoulders up is best and please make sure your audio is clearly able to be heard.\nVideo Question 2\nAll LGO applicants will be prompted to respond to a randomly generated, open-ended question. The question is designed to help us get to know you better; to see how you express yourself and to assess fit with the MIT Sloan culture. It does not require prior preparation. \nVideo Essay 2 is part of your required application materials and will appear as a page within the application, once the other parts of your application are completed. Applicants are given 5 seconds to prepare for a 60-second response.\nShort Answer Question\nThe Admissions Committee is excited to learn more about you and your background. In 250 words, please respond to the following short answer question:\nHow has the world you come from shaped who you are today? For example, your family, culture, community, all help to shape aspects of your life experiences and perspective. Please use this opportunity to share more about your background.\nOrganizational Chart\nTo help us better understand your current role and the impact that you have on your team and department, please submit an organizational chart. We should be able to clearly understand the internal structure of your organization, where you sit in your organization, and your line of reporting. You can learn more about the specifics of the organizational chart on Sloan’s MBA application instructions.\nLetters of recommendation\nLGO applicants must submit two letters of recommendation, one professional and one technical, with the option of submitting a third additional technical recommendation letter.\nOne professional recommendation is required from an individual who is able to speak with certainty about your professional achievements and potential. Your professional recommendation should reflect your leadership and teamwork skills and should follow the recommendation guidelines on the Sloan application site.\nYour second recommendation should be a technical reference from someone who has worked with you on significant engineering and technical projects or coursework, and can speak to your ability to carry out advanced engineering research and projects. Examples of recommenders for the technical reference include a previous professor, a manager or senior colleague who is in a technical role such as chief engineer or data scientist. We prefer and encourage an academic source when possible. Your recommender should assess your academic and technical skills, particularly regarding analytical acumen, technical expertise and depth, quantitative problem solving, and the ability to look deeply into a technical problem. This letter can follow the MIT Sloan recommendation prompts, but we are looking for answers specifically to the following additional questions:\n\nPlease give an example of an engineering/technical project or challenge that the applicant faced, and the resources they used in addressing it.\nAssess this applicant’s ability to continue graduate education in an engineering field, based on your observations of how this candidate addresses advanced technical coursework and problems.\n\nPlease navigate to the Recommendation Letter section of the application and add your recommender’s contact information; they will be sent instructions on how to submit their letter.\nPlease note: We strongly encourage submitting an additional technical letter of recommendation if feasible. Additional insights into your technical abilities and problem solving skills can further strengthen your application, as long as they are from a recommender who can provide specific examples. Keep in mind we will review all submitted material as is and without negative inferences if candidates do not submit a 3rd recommendation.\n[CARD]\nInterviews\nInterviews will be scheduled by invitation only, after an initial evaluation of a complete application. We only interview a select number of candidates who apply, but receiving an invitation to interview does not guarantee admission. For the foreseeable future all admission interviews will be conducted virtually, and we will contact you with more information.\nThose invited to interview will be prompted to submitted two short essay questions in advance of the interview. More details will be shared in the interview invitation.\n[CARD]\nInterviews\nInterviews\n[CARD]\nInterviews\n[CARD]\nInterviews will be scheduled by invitation only, after an initial evaluation of a complete application.

Goody Award to support her thesis project focused on reusing steel studs to build load-bearing steel frame walls, using geometry and multi-objective optimization in a top-down design approach.\nFontaine is pursuing a Master of Engineering in the Structural Mechanics and Design Track, working under the guidance of Caitlin Mueller, associate professor in the departments of civil and environmental engineering and architecture, and director of the Digital Structures Lab. Previously, Fontaine studied architecture at the ENSA Paris-Belleville in Paris, France.\nThe Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry produces 40 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, while steel studs, a common material used in construction, can account for up to 10 percent of site waste. By reusing discarded studs within a stock-limited framework, it is possible to construct sustainable and efficient structures. Through her research, Fontaine aims to address the role that AEC industry plays in climate change, while addressing global housing and infrastructure needs and reducing emissions.\n“I am delighted that Anouk has been recognized with the Marvin E. Goody Award for her innovative research,” says Professor Caitlin Mueller. “This achievement reflects her commitment to addressing critical challenges in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction industry. Her work exploring the practice of reuse builds upon the current research and has the potential to transform how we approach material reuse and industry standard practices.”\nThe Marvin E. Goody Award, sponsored by the Department of Architecture, is given each term to a student in any department at MIT expected to complete their SM Thesis or equivalent at the end of the following term. The award, established in 1983, aims to extend the horizons of existing building techniques and use of materials, to encourage links between the academic world and the building industry, and to increase appreciation of the bond between good design and good building.\n• Alumni\n• Awards\n• CEE Profiles\n• Classes\n• Events\n• Faculty Spotlight\n• Fieldwork\n• Graduate Spotlight\n• IAP\n• Internships\n• MEng\n• mini-UROP\n• MIT News\n• News\n• Obituary\n• ONE-MA3\n• Postdoc Spotlight\n• Research\n• Staff Spotlight\n• Study Abroad\n• TREX\n• Undergraduate Spotlight\n• Undergraduate Student Life\n[GRID_TABLE]\nAwards\nSubscribe Browse\n[GRID_TABLE]\nAlumni\nAwards\nCEE Profiles\nClasses\nEvents\nFaculty Spotlight\nFieldwork\nGraduate Spotlight\nInternships\nmini-UROP\nMIT News\nObituary\nONE-MA3\nPostdoc Spotlight\nResearch\nStaff Spotlight\nStudy Abroad\nUndergraduate Spotlight\nUndergraduate Student Life\n[GRID_TABLE]\nMIT Civil and Environmental Engineering graduate student Anouk Fontaine receives Marvin E.

It ended up being the only undergraduate program Pittman applied to. “I just wanted to be part of something bigger than myself, and all the opportunity West Point could give was pretty incredible,” she says.\nPittman’s parents also recognized her passion for design and encouraged her to consider a career in architecture. Although West Point didn’t offer an architecture program, she chose civil engineering, a field that allowed her to combine her love of math and design.\nAfter graduating, she was commissioned as an engineer officer in the U.S. Army and has served for over seven years. She is now pursuing her graduate education at MIT in structural engineering with advisor John Ochsendorf, professor of civil and environmental engineering and architecture. Pittman is researching Gothic-style infrastructure for its masonry resiliency and stability over time, specifically Beauvais Cathedral and its structural safety. One of the reasons she chose to pursue her graduate studies in CEE was the department’s openness to explore diverse research opportunities.\n“I was really drawn to the ability to carve my own research niche and have the freedom to figure out what really interests me, rather than being presented with a limited set of research options,” says Pittman.\nAfter receiving her master’s degree, Pittman will return to West Point as a faculty member for three years and then continue her service obligation in the Army. She credits her mentors at West Point as being instrumental in her academic and professional journey and hopes to play a role in shaping the lives of future generations of cadets.\n“I have incredible mentors that I still talk to, and I really wanted to be able to go back and give back to a place, and the people that gave me so much support and room to grow and find my passion. Every step has been made in my career so far to get back to West Point and teach in the civil engineering department.”\nPittman also acknowledges and values the Army for the opportunities it has provided her, particularly the chance to pursue her master’s degree at MIT, the relationships she has built along the way and career path it has opened.\n“I’ve enjoyed getting to know the soldiers from all over the world and seeing them in this environment where you might give each other a hard time, but at the end of the day you know that you have each other’s back.”\nJacqueline Orr, also a U.S. Military Academy graduate, is currently pursuing a master’s degree in structural engineering under the guidance of Josephine Carstensen, the Gilbert W. Winslow Career Development Associate Professor for Civil and Environmental Engineering. Inspired by her father to pursue a strong foundation in math and science, she earned a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering. After graduation, she fulfilled her service obligation and served for six years as a member of the 173rd Airborne Brigade based in Vicenza, Italy — a unit renowned for its history, combat readiness, and crucial part of the Army’s joint integration with NATO.\nReflecting on her experience, Orr says, “Airborne units, like many great units in the Army, require overcoming an additional litmus test — in this case, conquering the fear of jumping from high-performance aircraft, hundreds of feet above the ground.”\nWhile she enjoyed her time in the Army, her experiences ultimately led her to pursue a career more closely aligned with her passion for engineering. “When I was studying mechanical engineering, I developed a strong interest in structures during my senior design project,” she says.\nShe particularly enjoyed learning how to model structures and analyze how they respond to various forces. She felt that the traditional methods taught in her classes lacked an optimization component, which sparked her interest in topology optimization as a potential solution.\nThis desire to further explore topology optimization — specifically in relation to structures and their behavior under different forces — motivated her to seek graduate programs specializing in this field. Orr applied for and was awarded a Department of Defense (DoD) SMART Scholarship that brought her to MIT to study topology optimization in the Carstensen Lab.\n“MIT was the ideal institution to pursue this research due to Professor Carstensen’s expertise and innovative work happening in the civil and environmental engineering department,” Orr says.\nLooking ahead, Orr plans to apply the knowledge gained at MIT to a research-oriented career as part of her obligation as a DoD SMART Scholar. But for now, she’s adjusting to life as a graduate student. “I’m really enjoying my classes and getting to know people in the lab — it’s been an amazing experience,” she adds.\n• Alumni\n• Awards\n• CEE Profiles\n• Classes\n• Events\n• Faculty Spotlight\n• Fieldwork\n• Graduate Spotlight\n• IAP\n• Internships\n• MEng\n• mini-UROP\n• MIT News\n• News\n• Obituary\n• ONE-MA3\n• Postdoc Spotlight\n• Research\n• Staff Spotlight\n• Study Abroad\n• TREX\n• Undergraduate Spotlight\n• Undergraduate Student Life\n[GRID_TABLE]\nGraduate Spotlight\nSubscribe Browse\n[GRID_TABLE]\nAlumni\nAwards\nCEE Profiles\nClasses\nEvents\nFaculty Spotlight\nFieldwork\nGraduate Spotlight\nInternships\nmini-UROP\nMIT News\nObituary\nONE-MA3\nPostdoc Spotlight\nResearch\nStaff Spotlight\nStudy Abroad\nUndergraduate Spotlight\nUndergraduate Student Life\n[GRID_TABLE]\nBridging military service and engineering Written by: CEE Chief EditorHome » News » MIT News » Bridging military service and engineering\nPublished on: Nov 08, 2024 Nov 08 2024",

Goody Award\n[HEADING] Making airfield assessments automatic, remote, and safe\n[HEADING] Puzzling out climate change\nGraduate student Kirby Heck’s interest in physics and fluid mechanics led him to study engineering mechanics at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. He had always been drawn to the aesthetic aspects of the subject, and while aerodynamics is typically applied to airplanes and rockets, wind turbines depend on the same fundamental principles.\nNow, as a fourth-year graduate student working under the guidance of Assistant Professor Michael Howland, Heck studies the interactions between atmospheric turbulence and wind farms. “Wind turbines extract power from the wind and convert it into electricity, and this energy is replenished downwind by large-scale mixing of the atmosphere,” he explains. “How mixing and turbulent motions depend on current atmospheric dynamics in wind farms is not well understood. Furthermore, current models, which inform the construction and operation of wind farms, often neglect these physics.”\nIn his research, Heck uses computational fluid dynamics to set up experiments for improving models of turbulence and mixing in wind farms and in the atmosphere. He co-authored a recent paper in Nature Communications, which reports a new model that accurately represents the airflow around rotors, even in extreme operating conditions. The model could not only improve the way rotors themselves are designed, but also the way wind farms are laid out and operated.\nHeck has always been passionate about climate solutions, an interest which has only grown since coming to MIT. “When I first came here, I believed energy and decarbonization was the most pressing issue regarding climate change but being in the civil and environmental engineering department has opened me up to the depth of climate solutions happening at MIT.”\nBeyond his research, Heck has become a valuable member of the CEE community, contributing his knowledge and leadership skills to various student organizations and initiatives.\nAs a member of the CEE Graduate Committee, a student group committed to enriching graduate student experiences through educational development, professional development, and community outreach, Heck was inspired to start the Graduate Student Seminar Series after seeing the success of the department’s Faculty Seminar Series. “I started the Graduate Seminar Series as a way of showcasing the diverse work of students in the different labs and areas of CEE,” he says.\nHeck is also president and graduate student advisor of the MIT Wind team, an Edgerton Center build team that he founded in 2022. The team will participate in the 2025 Department of Energy (DOE) Collegiate Wind Competition (CWC). “Our goal this year is to advance to the finals with our model turbine prototype and our project development plan for a hypothetical, utility-scale offshore wind farm,” he says.\nIn addition, he has taken a leadership role in organizing K-12 outreach activities within CEE, volunteering at the Cambridge Science Festival and multiple K-12 outreach programs, teaching young students and community members about the benefits of wind turbines and renewable energy.\n“I really enjoy exploring science and technology with young people and community members,” he says. “We recently had a table about harnessing power from the wind at Cambridge Science Festival where we made over 100 small wind turbines that participants could take home. Outreach fuels me to keep learning and experimenting with effectively communicating science to the public.”\nThis passion for educating the younger generation about renewable energy and climate technology inspired Heck to develop an active learning game for middle schoolers to engage them in the challenges of decarbonizing the electricity sector.\n“The goal is to allow students to discover the trade-offs between traditional fossil fuel-based electricity generation and variable renewable sources of electricity by role playing a decarbonizing power grid,” he explains.\nThe game requires participants to work cooperatively to effectively spend their revenue to mitigate polluting the environment while maintaining constant electricity supply to their towns. “The game never fails to get a room full of creative minds working toward a common goal of engineering new solutions to climate change.”\nHeck’s game was tested at MIT Spark in 2024 under the title “Watt’s the solution?” and will continue to be developed in partnership with Cambridge Public Schools this winter.\nWhile he is still deciding what life will look like after graduation, he is leaning towards a career in academia, “I love teaching engineering physics, like fluid and solid mechanics, to undergraduate and graduate students,” he says. “It would be amazing to hold a faculty role and build a career around learning alongside my future students.”\nHeck often finds himself inspired by the intellectual diversity and wide range of research topics studied in the department. “It feels like someone in CEE touches every corner of climate change, from atmospheric chemistry to transportation systems and everything in between. It’s why we started the graduate student seminar series, and I’m always excited to hear what my neighbors in the office are working on.”\n• Alumni\n• Awards\n• CEE Profiles\n• Classes\n• Events\n• Faculty Spotlight\n• Fieldwork\n• Graduate Spotlight\n• IAP\n• Internships\n• MEng\n• mini-UROP\n• MIT News\n• News\n• Obituary\n• ONE-MA3\n• Postdoc Spotlight\n• Research\n• Staff Spotlight\n• Study Abroad\n• TREX\n• Undergraduate Spotlight\n• Undergraduate Student Life\n[GRID_TABLE]\nGraduate Spotlight\nSubscribe Browse\n[GRID_TABLE]\nAlumni\nAwards\nCEE Profiles\nClasses\nEvents\nFaculty Spotlight\nFieldwork\nGraduate Spotlight\nInternships\nmini-UROP\nMIT News\nObituary\nONE-MA3\nPostdoc Spotlight\nResearch\nStaff Spotlight\nStudy Abroad\nUndergraduate Spotlight\nUndergraduate Student Life\n[GRID_TABLE]\nEngineering the future of wind power Written by: Callie AyoubHome » News » Graduate Spotlight » Engineering the future of wind power\nPublished on: Dec 06, 2024 Dec 06 2024",

Now he incorporates design as an iterative process in the writing of algorithms that perfectly balance the forces involved in discrete portions of a structure to create an overall design that optimizes function, minimizes carbon footprint, and still produces a manufacturable result.\nWhile this may sound like an obvious goal in structural design, it’s not. It’s new. It’s a more holistic way of looking at the design process that can optimize even down to the materials, angles, and number of elements in the nodes or joints that connect the larger components of a building, bridge, tower, etc.\nAccording to Schemmer, there hasn’t been much progress on optimizing structural design to minimize embodied carbon, and the work that exists often results in designs that are “too complex to be built in real life,” he says. The embodied carbon of a structure is the total carbon dioxide emissions of its life cycle: from the extraction or manufacture of its materials to their transport and use and through the demolition of the structure and disposal of the materials. Schemmer, who works with Josephine V. Carstensen, the Gilbert W. Winslow Career Development Associate Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering at MIT, is focusing on the portion of that cycle that runs through construction.\nIn September, at the IASS 2024 symposium “Redefining the Art of Structural Design in Zurich,” Schemmer and Carstensen presented their work on Discrete Topology Optimization algorithms that are able to minimize the embodied carbon in a bridge or other structure by up to 20 percent. This comes through materials selection that considers not only a material’s appearance and its ability to get the job done, but also the ease of procurement, its proximity to the building site, and the carbon embodied in its manufacture and transport.\n“The real novelty of our algorithm is its ability to consider multiple materials in a highly constrained solution space to produce manufacturable designs with a user-specified force flow,” Schemmer says. “Real-life problems are complex and often have many constraints associated with them. In traditional formulations, it can be difficult to have a long list of complicated constraints. Our goal is to incorporate these constraints to make it easier to take our designs out of the computer and create them in real life.”\nTake, for instance, a steel tower, which could be a “super lightweight, efficient design solution,” Schemmer explains. Because steel is so strong, you don’t need as much of it compared to concrete or timber to build a big building. But steel is also very carbon-intensive to produce and transport. Shipping it across the country or especially from a different continent can sharply increase its embodied carbon price tag. Schemmer’s topology optimization will replace some of the steel with timber elements or decrease the amount of steel in other elements to create a hybrid structure that will function effectively and minimize the carbon footprint. “This is why using the same steel in two different parts of the world can lead to two different optimized designs,” he explains.\nSchemmer, who grew up in the mountains of Utah, earned a BS and MS in civil and environmental engineering from University of California at Berkeley, where his graduate work focused on seismic design. He describes that education as providing a “very traditional, super-strong engineering background that tackled some of the toughest engineering problems,” along with knowledge of structural engineering’s traditions and current methods.\nBut at MIT, he says, a lot of the work he sees “looks at removing the constraints of current societal conventions of doing things, and asks how could we do things if it was in a more ideal form; what are we looking at then? Which I think is really cool,” he says. “But I think sometimes too, there’s a jump between the most-perfect version of something and where we are now, that there needs to be a bridge between those two. And I feel like my education helps me see that bridge.”\nThe bridge he’s referring to is the topology optimization algorithms that make good designs better in terms of decreased global warming potential.\n“That’s where the optimization algorithm comes in,” Schemmer says. “In contrast to a standard structure designed in the past, the algorithm can take the same design space and come up with a much more efficient material usage that still meets all the structural requirements, be up to code, and have everything we want from a safety standpoint.”\nThat’s also where the MAD Design Fellowship comes in. The program provides yearlong fellowships with full financial support to graduate students from all across the Institute who network with each other, with the MAD faculty, and with outside speakers who use design in new ways in a surprising variety of fields. This helps the fellows gain a better understanding of how to use iterative design in their own work.\n“Usually people think of their own work like, ‘Oh, I had this background. I’ve been looking at this one way for a very long time.’ And when you look at it from an outside perspective, I think it opens your mind to be like, ‘Oh my God. I never would have thought about doing this that way. Maybe I should try that.’ And then we can move to new ideas, new inspiration for better work,” Schemmer says.\nHe chose civil and structural engineering over architecture some seven years ago, but says that “100 years ago, I don’t think architecture and structural engineering were two separate professions. I think there was an understanding of how things looked and how things worked, and it was merged together. Maybe from an efficiency standpoint, it’s better to have things done separately. But I think there’s something to be said for having knowledge about how the whole system works, potentially more intermingling between the free-form architectural design and the mathematical design of a civil engineer. Merging it back together, I think, has a lot of benefits.”\nWhich brings us back to the Golden Gate Bridge, Schemmer’s longtime favorite. You can still hear that excited 3-year-old in his voice when he talks about it.\n“It’s so iconic,” he says. “It’s connecting these two spits of land that just rise straight up out of the ocean. There’s this fog that comes in and out a lot of days. It’s a really magical place, from the size of the cable strands and everything. It’s just, ‘Wow.’ People built this over 100 years ago, before the existence of a lot of the computational tools that we have now. So, all the math, everything in the design, was all done by hand and from the mind. Nothing was computerized, which I think is crazy to think about.”\nAs Schemmer continues work on his doctoral degree at MIT, the MAD fellowship will expose him to many more awe-inspiring ideas in other fields, leading him to incorporate some of these in some way with his engineering knowledge to design better ways of building bridges and other structures.\n• Alumni\n• Awards\n• CEE Profiles\n• Classes\n• Events\n• Faculty Spotlight\n• Fieldwork\n• Graduate Spotlight\n• IAP\n• Internships\n• MEng\n• mini-UROP\n• MIT News\n• News\n• Obituary\n• ONE-MA3\n• Postdoc Spotlight\n• Research\n• Staff Spotlight\n• Study Abroad\n• TREX\n• Undergraduate Spotlight\n• Undergraduate Student Life\n[GRID_TABLE]\nCEE Profiles\nSubscribe Browse\n[GRID_TABLE]\nAlumni\nAwards\nCEE Profiles\nClasses\nEvents\nFaculty Spotlight\nFieldwork\nGraduate Spotlight\nInternships\nmini-UROP\nMIT News\nObituary\nONE-MA3\nPostdoc Spotlight\nResearch\nStaff Spotlight\nStudy Abroad\nUndergraduate Spotlight\nUndergraduate Student Life\n[GRID_TABLE]\nMinimizing the carbon footprint of bridges and other structures Written by: CEE Chief EditorHome » News » MIT News » Minimizing the carbon footprint of bridges and other structures\nPublished on: Jan 10, 2025 Jan 10 2025",

For hours, his team walked over the area in chemical protection gear, radioing in geocoordinates as they documented damage and looked for threats like unexploded munitions.\nThe work is standard for all Air Force engineers before they deploy, but it held special significance for Pietersen, who has spent the last five years developing faster, safer approaches for assessing airfields as a master’s student and now a PhD candidate and MathWorks Fellow at MIT. For Pietersen, the time-intensive, painstaking, and potentially dangerous work underscored the potential for his research to enable remote airfield assessments.\n“That experience was really eye-opening,” Pietersen says. “We’ve been told for almost a decade that a new, drone-based system is in the works, but it is still limited by an inability to identify unexploded ordnances; from the air, they look too much like rocks or debris. Even ultra-high-resolution cameras just don’t perform well enough. Rapid and remote airfield assessment is not the standard practice yet. We’re still only prepared to do this on foot, and that’s where my research comes in.”\nPietersen’s goal is to create drone-based automated systems for assessing airfield damage and detecting unexploded munitions. This has taken him down a number of research paths, from deep learning to small uncrewed aerial systems to “hyperspectral” imaging, which captures passive electromagnetic radiation across a broad spectrum of wavelengths. Hyperspectral imaging is getting cheaper, faster, and more durable, which could make Pietersen’s research increasingly useful in a range of applications including agriculture, emergency response, mining, and building assessments.\nFinding computer science and community\nGrowing up in a suburb of Sacramento, California, Pietersen gravitated toward math and physics in school. But he was also a cross country athlete and an Eagle Scout, and he wanted a way to put his interests together.\n“I liked the multifaceted challenge the Air Force Academy presented,” Pietersen says. “My family doesn’t have a history of serving, but the recruiters talked about the holistic education, where academics were one part, but so was athletic fitness and leadership. That well-rounded approach to the college experience appealed to me.”\nPietersen majored in civil engineering as an undergrad at the Air Force Academy, where he first began learning how to conduct academic research. This required him to learn a little bit of computer programming.\n“In my senior year, the Air Force research labs had some pavement-related projects that fell into my scope as a civil engineer,” Pietersen recalls. “While my domain knowledge helped define the initial problems, it was very clear that developing the right solutions would require a deeper understanding of computer vision and remote sensing.”\nThe projects, which dealt with airfield pavement assessments and threat detection, also led Pietersen to start using hyperspectral imaging and machine learning, which he built on when he came to MIT to pursue his master’s and PhD in 2020.\n“MIT was a clear choice for my research because the school has such a strong history of research partnerships and multidisciplinary thinking that helps you solve these unconventional problems,” Pietersen says. “There’s no better place in the world than MIT for cutting-edge work like this.”\nBy the time Pietersen got to MIT, he’d also embraced extreme sports like ultra-marathons, skydiving, and rock climbing. Some of that stemmed from his participation in infantry skills competitions as an undergrad. The multiday competitions are military-focused races in which teams from around the world traverse mountains and perform graded activities like tactical combat casualty care, orienteering, and marksmanship.\n“The crowd I ran with in college was really into that stuff, so it was sort of a natural consequence of relationship-building,” Pietersen says. “These events would run you around for 48 or 72 hours, sometimes with some sleep mixed in, and you get to compete with your buddies and have a good time.”\nSince coming to MIT with his wife and two children, Pietersen has embraced the local running community and even worked as an indoor skydiving instructor in New Hampshire, though he admits the East Coast winters have been tough for him and his family to adjust to.\nPietersen went remote between 2022 to 2024, but he wasn’t doing his research from the comfort of a home office. The training that showed him the reality of airfield assessments took place in Florida, and then he was deployed to Saudi Arabia. He happened to write one of his PhD journal publications from a tent in the desert.\nNow back at MIT and nearing the completion of his doctorate this spring, Pietersen is thankful for all the people who have supported him in throughout his journey.\n“It has been fun exploring all sorts of different engineering disciplines, trying to figure things out with the help of all the mentors at MIT and the resources available to work on these really niche problems,” Pietersen says.\nResearch with a purpose\nIn the summer of 2020, Pietersen did an internship with the HALO Trust, a humanitarian organization working to clear landmines and other explosives from areas impacted by war. The experience demonstrated another powerful application for his work at MIT.\n“We have post-conflict regions around the world where kids are trying to play and there are landmines and unexploded ordnances in their backyards,” Pietersen says. “Ukraine is a good example of this in the news today. There are always remnants of war left behind. Right now, people have to go into these potentially dangerous areas and clear them, but new remote-sensing techniques could speed that process up and make it far safer.”\nAlthough Pietersen’s master’s work primarily revolved around assessing normal wear and tear of pavement structures, his PhD has focused on ways to detect unexploded ordnances and more severe damage.\n“If the runway is attacked, there would be bombs and craters all over it,” Pietersen says. “This makes for a challenging environment to assess. Different types of sensors extract different kinds of information and each has its pros and cons. There is still a lot of work to be done on both the hardware and software side of things, but so far, hyperspectral data appears to be a promising discriminator for deep learning object detectors.”\nAfter graduation, Pietersen will be stationed in Guam, where Air Force engineers regularly perform the same airfield assessment simulations he participated in in Florida. He hopes someday soon, those assessments will be done not by humans in protective gear, but by drones.\n“Right now, we rely on visible lines of site,” Pietersen says. “If we can move to spectral imaging and deep-learning solutions, we can finally conduct remote assessments that make everyone safer.”\n• Alumni\n• Awards\n• CEE Profiles\n• Classes\n• Events\n• Faculty Spotlight\n• Fieldwork\n• Graduate Spotlight\n• IAP\n• Internships\n• MEng\n• mini-UROP\n• MIT News\n• News\n• Obituary\n• ONE-MA3\n• Postdoc Spotlight\n• Research\n• Staff Spotlight\n• Study Abroad\n• TREX\n• Undergraduate Spotlight\n• Undergraduate Student Life\n[GRID_TABLE]\nGraduate Spotlight\nSubscribe Browse\n[GRID_TABLE]\nAlumni\nAwards\nCEE Profiles\nClasses\nEvents\nFaculty Spotlight\nFieldwork\nGraduate Spotlight\nInternships\nmini-UROP\nMIT News\nObituary\nONE-MA3\nPostdoc Spotlight\nResearch\nStaff Spotlight\nStudy Abroad\nUndergraduate Spotlight\nUndergraduate Student Life\n[GRID_TABLE]\nMaking airfield assessments automatic, remote, and safe Written by:\n Zach WinnHome » News » MIT News » Making airfield assessments automatic, remote, and safe\nPublished on: Mar 13, 2025 Mar 13 2025",
