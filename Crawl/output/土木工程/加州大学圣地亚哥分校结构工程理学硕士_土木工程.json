Currently, the department has three MS programs:\nThe doctor of philosophy (Ph.D.) degree program is intended to prepare students for careers in teaching, research, and/or in their chosen professional specialties. The Ph.D. program requires a departmental comprehensive examination, a Ph.D. candidacy examination, a Ph.D. dissertation based on new and unique research, and a dissertation defense. The student is required to closely work with a faculty advisor.\nAll of the degrees offer opportunities for training in one or more of the following primary research areas within our department:\nAll accepted PhD students will be offered a financial support package in accordance to the Graduate Funding Reform Policy.  This policy currently states: \"Effective winter quarter (2020), Doctoral and MFA students who were admitted with a guarantee of support must be supported at the minimum of the equivalent of a 50% Teaching Assistantship.\" For the Department of Structural Engineering, this support will be for the duration of our PhD program, typically up to five years.\nFinancial support may come in the forms of university fellowships, research assistantships, and Teaching Assistantships. The fellowships include the Department fellowships and those provided by the Jacobs School of Engineering and the Office of Graduate Studies. The fellowship award normally starts in October through the end of September. The Jacobs School of Engineering fellowships are reserved for first-year Ph.D. students only.\nIncoming M.S. students in the Comprehensive Exam program Structural Engineering are not offered financial support when admitted into the program. M.S. students enrolled in the Thesis program may be supported by their research advisors and paid as a Graduate Student Researcher, but will not be offered financial support when admitted. Additionally, the funding may not start until after the M.S. student completes coursework and is ready to start the research.\nTeaching Assistantships are available on a quarterly basis to Ph.D. students. All graduate student TA’s & Reader’s employed at 25% time or more are eligible for Partial Tuition fee remission that will reduce their Registration fees quarterly. Non-resident tuition is usually paid by the student if they are only supported by a 25% time Teaching Assistantship.\nContinuing and incoming Ph.D. students that are employed as Graduate Student Researchers will have the opportunity to receive pay increases after passing the Candidacy examination. The maximum stipend allowed by the department for students employed as Graduate Student Researcher is 49% rate at Step 7. The faculty research advisor in charge of the funded research project assigns the duties of a GSR. These appointments are subject to the availability of research funds each year.\nFINANCIAL AID: http://students.ucsd.edu/finances/financial-ai\n\tGraduate Financial Support Page: https://grad.ucsd.edu/financial/index.html\nIn 2023-2024 full-time students who are California Residents pay an estimated $6,315.12 per quarter in registration fees. Non-residents pay an estimated total of $11,349.12 per quarter for registration, supplement tuition, and incidental fees. There is a reduced-fee structure for students enrolled on a half-time basis. Costs are subject to change.  For more information, please review the Graduate Division Office's tuition and fees.\nNon-residents of the state of California must establish residency immediately upon entering the State. If students do not establish residency by the end of their first year of study, out of state tuition WILL NOT BE COVERED UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. This means that even if a student holds a TA or Graduate Student Researcher position, the out of state tuition will not be covered under these jobs.\nUCSD provides apartments for graduate students. There is also a variety of off-campus housing in the surrounding communities.

This unique facility consists of a set of large-scale testing laboratories where full-scale structural systems ranging from bridges and buildings, ship hulls and deck structures, to aircraft wings and structural systems can be tested using state-of-the-art computer-controlled equipment.\nThe Structural Systems Laboratory houses a 15-m tall reaction wall and a 37-m long strong floor, while the Structural Components Laboratory has a 9-m tall by 19-m wide strong wall with a 14.3 -by 21.3-m strong floor, and the Composites Structures Laboratory has a 9-m tall by 5.5-m wide strong wall with a 14.3 -by 7.2-m strong floor. The facility also includes a high-capacity shake table and a geotechnical laboratory including a centrifuge and soil boxes. The research facilities also include state-of-the-art nano-materials characterization facilities, polymer and composite characterization and processing laboratories, composites and aerospace structures laboratories, non-destructive evaluation laboratories, structural dynamics laboratory, a unique 6-DOF seismic response modification device test facility, and other unique facilities.\nThe Englekirk Structural Engineering Center is equipped with the world's first outdoor shake table adjacent to the country's largest soil-structure interaction test facility, allowing researchers to perform dynamic earthquake safety tests on full-scale structural systems. It also houses a blast simulator, which is the world’s first facility designed to study structural response to, and damage caused by, bomb blasts without creating actual explosions. Besides enabling one-of-a-kind experiments, the laboratory facilities enable the validation of sophisticated design and analysis models, which are subsequently used for design, numerical prediction, and detailed parametric studies.
