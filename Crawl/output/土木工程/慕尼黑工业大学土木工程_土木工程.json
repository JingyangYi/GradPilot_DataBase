Sc.\n[HEADING] What you'll learn for your future?\n[HEADING] Study Information\n[HEADING] Facts and Structure\n[HEADING] Course Content\n[HEADING] Going Abroad\n[HEADING] Application and Admission\nIn the Master's degree course in Civil Engineering, you will deepen the specialist and methodological knowledge you have already acquired in the Bachelor's degree course in Civil Engineering or a related course. The course offers a variety of in-depth and specialization modules.\nThe tasks in civil engineering are wide-ranging in terms of ecological and economic aspects. Environmental engineering, for example, is a rapidly growing field of application.\nCivil engineers work as employees, freelancers and civil servants in construction companies, public administrations, engineering offices, transport companies, in the real estate industry and in many interdisciplinary fields of work. They work in teams and often organize the collaboration of different disciplines.\nCivil engineers deal with the design, planning, construction and the operation of building structures and infrastructure (roads, water and sewage systems) from an engineering science perspective. Conceptualizing, planning, calculating, designing, and organizing are important job characteristics for a civil engineer. Typical work fields are:\nMore information on the M.Sc. Civil Engineering can be found on our TUM Civil Engineering Wiki.\nType of Study: Full TimeStandard Duration of Studies: 4 SemesterCredits: 120 ECTSMain Locations: MunichAdmission Category: Aptitude Assessment for MasterStart of Degree Program: Summer and Winter SemesterApplication Period: Winter semester: 01.04. – 31.05. and Summer semester: 01.11. – 15.01.Required Language Proficiency: English or GermanTuition Fees: for Students from Non-EU Countries\nThe master's degree program in civil engineering consists of four semesters, in the course of which 120 ECTS credits have to be earned. The master's thesis accounts for 30 of these credits.\nThe program offers both German and English modules. The language of the course depends on the module. Students are free in their choice of modules and usually choose based on their interests and goals rather than the language of the module. Students do not have to choose one language for all of their courses. Depending on which modules they choose, students can, however, study in only German or English or combine the languages.\nCivil engineering is a very broad field, which is reflected in the range of courses offered. In order to do this justice, 22 fields of specialization are offered. Students create their individual course profile by choosing four fields of specialization. The fourth field of specialization can be replaced with an individual specialization.\nThe specialization can, for example, be in architecture, mechanical engineering or even IT. It can also be used to complement the other three fields of specialization with further useful civil engineering modules.\nIn order to provide students with the best possible support during their studies, one of the fields of specialization is chosen as their major subject. The supervisor for this field takes on a mentor role, supporting and advising the students in particular when it comes to choosing the right fields of specialization. However, this mentor not only makes sure that the course contents match the occupational profile but also, for example, that the selected courses and modules are suitable for a stay abroad and that they match the students' professional visions. This is particularly important when choosing a specialization as in this case compulsory and elective modules have to be approved by the mentor.\nEvery field of specialization is made up of compulsory and elective modules. Compulsory modules are reflected in the compulsory module catalog, which accounts for 12 credits. This catalog guarantees that the basic knowledge in the field of specialization is acquired. This basic knowledge can be expanded upon with elective modules in the field. The elective modules chosen in each field of specialization have to add up to at least 6 credits in order to ensure that in-depth expertise is gained in addition to basic knowledge. For specialization, compulsory modules have to account for 12 ECTS credits and elective modules for 9 credits.\nIn addition to the ECTS credits obtained in the elective modules in the fields of specialization, students need to acquire 12 credits from the entire catalog of civil engineering elective modules. Students who have chosen an interdisciplinary specialization only need to acquire 9 credits. This gives students the opportunity to deepen their knowledge in other fields of civil engineering that are not part of the fields of specialization and to acquire skills that go beyond the field of civil engineering. In order to guarantee the general education component in civil engineering, 6 credits are to be selected from the overall TUM course offer. Students often choose language courses that contribute to their ability to communicate, especially in an international context.\nThe master's program is completed with the master's thesis, which students write in one of their fields of specialization.\nThere are many ways to spend a shorter or longer period abroad during the Master’s studies - for studying or an internship.\nApart from the well-known Erasmus + program, there are a number of other exchange opportunities available for TUM students. Detailed information can be found on the website of the Department for Study- Wiki.\nA recognition of modules from a stay abroad can be achieved in four ways: recognition as equivalent and free elective credits.\nThe recognition as equivalent means that a module from the TUM-study programme is replaced by an identical module from the partner university. The decision upon this equivalence is taken by the professor responsible for the course at TUM based on the module descriptions. The forms for the recognition are provided by the examination officer.\nA recognition as a partner university modul, in the personalized specialication or in the supplementary subjects does not require a full equivalence of the modules. If they fit in the thematic scope of the study programme and they are not overlapping with already passed modules at TUM, they can be transferred directly. In this case please consult with the student advisor of the master’s programme. In the master’s programme students can bring in up to 30 credits from the partner university as electives (this applies also to the cross cutting methods ) through this procedure.  Students staying abroad with a leave of absence can bring in up to 20 credits per semester from the partner university without a cancellation of the leave of absence.\nAn internship abroad qualifies for the bachelor’s programme if it fulfils the requirements for the required internship. Please consult with the internship office in advance to get a confirmation.\nPlease apply through the TUMonline application portal and upload your application documents.\nFor information about the general application procedure at TUM, please visit the following website: Applying for a Master's Program at TUM.\nThe Master’s Programme in Civil Engineering offers admissions every semester.

In this case please consult with the student advisor of the master’s programme. In the master’s programme students can bring in up to 30 credits from the partner university as electives (this applies also to the cross cutting methods ) through this procedure.  Students staying abroad with a leave of absence can bring in up to 20 credits per semester from the partner university without a cancellation of the leave of absence. \nAn internship abroad qualifies for the bachelor’s programme if it fulfils the requirements for the required internship. Please consult with the internship office in advance to get a confirmation.\nGoing Abroad\nThere are many ways to spend a shorter or longer period abroad during the Master’s studies - for studying or an internship.\nApart from the well-known Erasmus + program, there are a number of other exchange opportunities available for TUM students. Detailed information can be found on the website of the Department for Study- Wiki.\nA recognition of modules from a stay abroad can be achieved in four ways: recognition as equivalent and free elective credits.\nThe recognition as equivalent means that a module from the TUM-study programme is replaced by an identical module from the partner university. The decision upon this equivalence is taken by the professor responsible for the course at TUM based on the module descriptions. The forms for the recognition are provided by the examination officer.\nA recognition as a partner university modul, in the personalized specialication or in the supplementary subjects does not require a full equivalence of the modules.
