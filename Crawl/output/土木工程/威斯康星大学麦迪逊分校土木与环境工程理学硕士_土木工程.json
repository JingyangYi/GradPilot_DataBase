MS research degree candidates will choose a pathway for their program of study: thesis or advanced independent study.\nStudents who do not have a bachelor's degree from an ABET-accredited engineering program, or from a recognized international institution, may be required to complete deficiency coursework in addition to completing either the thesis or advanced independent study curriculum requirements. Selection of a pathway is dependent upon the educational objectives of the candidate.\nPlease consult the table below for key information about this degree program’s admissions requirements. The program may have more detailed admissions requirements, which can be found below the table or on the program’s website.\nGraduate admissions is a two-step process between academic programs and the Graduate School. Applicants must meet the minimum requirements of the Graduate School as well as the program(s). Once you have researched the graduate program(s) you are interested in, apply online.\nAll applicants must meet the Graduate School's admission requirements to be considered for admission.  Departmental admission is by committee review.  Applications submitted after the fall deadline through March 15 will be reviewed if complete and will be considered for admission by the department if space is still available. To check if space is available, please email: ceegradadmission@engr.wisc.edu.\nIn addition, applicants must also meet the department's requirements listed below to be considered for admission:\nA minimum undergraduate grade-point average (GPA) of 3.00 (on a 4.00 scale) on the equivalent of the last 60 semester hours (approximately two years of work) or a master’s degree with a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.00 is required. Applicants from an international institution must demonstrate strong academic achievement comparable to a 3.00 for an undergraduate or master’s degree. The Graduate School will use your institution’s grading scale. Do not convert your grades to a 4.00 scale.\nA bachelor's degree from an ABET-accredited engineering program or from a recognized international institution is required. Applicants who do not have a bachelor's degree as specified above may study for the master of science in civil and environmental engineering (Pathway C). To do so, applicants must meet the department's deficiency requirements, some of which may be completed after admission. Generally, applicants with more than 12 credits of deficiencies are not admitted to the graduate program. Rather, they are encouraged to enroll as University Special students until most deficiencies are satisfied. All plans of study within this pathway must be approved by the department faculty. The deficiency requirements for applicants following Pathway C must be obtained directly from the department.\nFunded offers for MS (research) and PhD admitted applicants, in the form of research assistantships, project assistantships, and/or teaching assistantships come directly from individual faculty members.  Please contact interested faculty before or after you have applied to inquire about assistantship opportunities. Funding is not guaranteed with admission. Faculty will contact successful applicants directly regarding funding opportunities.\nA complete graduate application is required before an application will be reviewed by the faculty. A complete graduate application contains the following:\nApplicants must submit an online application to the UW–Madison Graduate School. See Graduate School Admissions to apply.\nSubmit a statement of purpose of 1,000 words or less in the online application. This statement should cover your technical areas of interest, coursework emphasis, research experience, professional goals, faculty members you are interested in working with, and any other items relevant to your qualifications for graduate school. See the Graduate School for additional guidelines for the Statement of Purpose (scroll to bottom of page).\nThree letters of recommendation must be submitted through the online application. These letters should be from people who can judge the applicant’s academic, research, and/or work performance.  See the Graduate School for FAQs regarding these letters.\nUpload the most recent copies of your transcripts to the online application, from each institution attended. Study abroad transcripts are not required if coursework is reflected on the degree granting university's transcript. Unofficial copies of transcripts will be accepted for departmental review. If the applicant is recommended for admission, then the Graduate School will follow-up with instructions for official transcript submission. Please do not send transcripts or any other application materials to the Graduate School or the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering unless requested.\nUpload your most recent resume or curriculum vitae in the online application.\nRefer to the Graduate School: Minimum Requirements for Admission policy.\nA one-time application fee is required. See the Graduate School frequently asked questions for fee information. Fee grants are offered by the Graduate School on a limited basis and under certain conditions, as outlined here. The department does not offer an application fee waiver due to the large volume of applications received. However, if you are working with a specific faculty member, then they may offer you a fee voucher.\nThe Bursar’s Office provides information about tuition and fees associated with being a graduate student. Resources to help you afford graduate study might include assistantships, fellowships, traineeships, and financial aid. Further funding information is available from the Graduate School. Be sure to check with your program for individual policies and restrictions related to funding.\nFinancial support is available through fellowships, project/program assistantships (PA), research assistantships (RA), and teaching assistantships (TA). Faculty will contact successful MS/PhD applicants directly regarding funding opportunities. Admission is not a guarantee of funding.\nReview the Graduate School minimum degree requirements and policies, in addition to the program requirements listed below.\nAccelerated: Accelerated programs are offered at a fast pace that condenses the time to completion. Students typically take enough credits aimed at completing the program in a year or two.\nEvening/Weekend: ​Courses meet on the UW–Madison campus only in evenings and/or on weekends to accommodate typical business schedules.  Students have the advantages of face-to-face courses with the flexibility to keep work and other life commitments.\nFace-to-Face: Courses typically meet during weekdays on the UW-Madison Campus.\nHybrid: These programs combine face-to-face and online learning formats.  Contact the program for more specific information.\nOnline: These programs are offered 100% online.  Some programs may require an on-campus orientation or residency experience, but the courses will be facilitated in an online format.\nStudents who wish to do advanced work and research in a well-defined area of specialization are encouraged to pursue this program.\nThis option requires a minimum of 30 credits of graduate work including:\nThese pathways are internal to the program and represent different curricular paths a student can follow to earn this degree. Pathway names do not appear in the Graduate School admissions application, and they will not appear on the transcript.\nSome courses numbered 300 or above may require special faculty approval.\nThis pathway requires a minimum of 30 credits of graduate work including:\nThis program is designed for students without an engineering bachelor’s degree. Prior to beginning the program, the student will meet with their faculty advisor to determine the courses and total credits required to fulfill the deficiency requirements. Generally, a student with more than 12 credits in deficiencies is not admitted to the program. Rather, they are encouraged to enroll as a University Special student until most of their deficiencies are satisfied. Some deficiency course requirements may be completed after admission. The exact number of deficiency courses and credits completed before and after admission will be determined by the faculty advisor. All prerequisite courses must be taken for a letter grade. In addition to the total deficiency credit requirement, Pathway C requires a minimum of 30 credits of graduate work. Students can select either Thesis Pathway A or Advanced Independent Study Pathway B, consistent with the requirements described above, to complete the non-deficiency requirements of Pathway C. Students should meet with their faculty advisor to determine which pathway is most appropriate for their degree plan. Deficiency credits cannot satisfy the minimum credit requirement.\nThe Graduate School’s Academic Policies and Procedures serve as the official document of record for Graduate School academic and administrative policies and procedures and are updated continuously. Note some policies redirect to entries in the official UW-Madison Policy Library. Programs may set more stringent policies than the Graduate School. Policies set by the academic degree program can be found below.\nRefer to the Graduate School: Transfer Credits for Prior Coursework policy.\nUpon approval from a student’s graduate advisor and the graduate program chair, the Civil and Environmental Engineering program may decide to transfer up to seven credits from another institution or numbered 300 or above from the undergraduate career completed at UW–Madison. Exceptions to this limit must be approved by the Graduate School. Transfer credits from other institutions must be equivalent to the rigor of UW-Madison courses numbered 300 and above. These credits are not allowed to count toward the 50% graduate coursework minimum unless numbered 700 or above from UW- Madison. The credits are noted on the transcript in the graduate career as transfer credits, but the courses remain in the undergraduate career if taken at UW-Madison.\nRefer to the Graduate School: Probation policy.\nRefer to the Graduate School: Advisor and Graduate School: Committees (Doctoral/Master’s/MFA) policies.\n15 credit maximum. Refer to the Graduate School: Maximum Credit Loads and Overload Requests policy.\nRefer to the Graduate School: Time Limits policy.\nThese resources may be helpful in addressing your concerns:\nStudents who feel that they have been treated unfairly have the right to a prompt hearing of their grievance.

In most cases, grievances can be resolved at this level.\n• Should a satisfactory resolution not be achieved, the student should contact the program’s Grievance Advisor to discuss the grievance. Currently, the Civil and Environmental Engineering Grievance Advisors are:\n• The Grievance Advisor is responsible for facilitating any complaints or issues of students. The Grievance Advisor first attempts to help students informally address the grievance prior to any formal complaint. Students are also encouraged to talk with their faculty advisors regarding concerns or difficulties if necessary. University resources for sexual harassment concerns can be found on the UW Office of Compliance website and are included in the next section.\n• If the issue is not resolved to the student’s satisfaction the student can submit the grievance to the Grievance Advisor in writing, within 60 calendar days of the alleged unfair treatment.\n• On receipt of a written complaint, a faculty committee will be convened by the Grievance Advisor to manage the grievance. The program faculty committee will obtain a written response from the person toward whom the complaint is directed. This response will be shared with the person filing the grievance.\n• The faculty committee will determine a decision regarding the grievance. The Grievance Advisor will report on the action taken by the committee in writing to both the student and the party toward whom the complaint was directed within 15 working days from the date the complaint was received.\n• At this point, if either party (the student or the person toward whom the grievance is directed) is unsatisfied with the decision of the faculty committee, the party may file a written appeal. Either party has 10 working days to file a written appeal to the College of Engineering.\n• Documentation of the grievance will be stored for at least 7 years. Significant grievances that set a precedent will be stored indefinitely.\n• Overview\n• Admissions\n• Funding\n• Requirements\n• Policies\n• Professional Development\n• Print page\n• Download page\n•

Such information pertains to:\nTo meet the requirement, information for the University of Wisconsin-Madison is provided on the Consumer Information webpage.\nUW-Madison complies with the requirements and standards set by the National Council for State Authorization Reciprocity Agreements (NC-SARA).\nDisclosures and information related to distance education at UW-Madison is available on the Distance Education, State Authorization, and Disclosures webpage.\nThe University of Wisconsin-Madison is a public institution registered as a \"Private Institution\" with the Minnesota Office of Higher Education pursuant to sections 136A.61 to 136A.71. Registration is not an endorsement of the institution. Credits earned at the institution may not transfer to all other institutions.\nThe University of Wisconsin-Madison is committed to providing equal opportunity and equal access in compliance with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations and Universities of Wisconsin and university non-discrimination policies and procedures.\nThe Office of Compliance promotes ethical conduct and compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and UW-Madison policies. UW-Madison’s non-discrimination statement, contact information for the university’s Equal Opportunity Investigations Administrator, Title IX Coordinator, ADA Coordinator as well as information regarding UW-Madison’s Equal Opportunity Complaint process is available on the Office of Compliance’s website.\nThe McBurney Disability Resource Center is an office within the Division of Student Affairs that views disability as an important aspect of the diversity of UW-Madison. The Center is committed to creating an accessible and inclusive educational experience for students, by partnering with students, faculty, and staff to design accessible environments and to provide academic accommodations so that students can engage, explore and participate in the Wisconsin Idea.\nThe Center works with UW-Madison students with physical, learning, hearing, vision, psychological, health and other disabilities substantially affecting a major life activity (e.g., walking, communicating, learning, seeing, breathing, reading, etc.). Many students have non-apparent disabilities such as depression, anxiety, autism spectrum, learning disabilities, AD/HD and health conditions such as Crohn’s disease or fibromyalgia.\nCommon accommodations include extended time and/or small group environment for exams, note taking support, sign language interpreting, real time and media captioning, and conversion of printed materials to accessible formats. McBurney Center staff members also collaborate with students and faculty to determine reasonable flexibility with regard to attendance, participation, and deadlines for conditions that fluctuate in severity over the course of enrollment. The Center makes referrals to other campus offices or community resources for non-classroom accommodations related to housing, transportation, personal care needs, and so on. Students should contact the Center upon admission to begin the eligibility for services process. Early notice is essential in order to have accommodations in place prior to the start of the semester.

Students are responsible for knowing current university regulations. University offices can provide current information about possible changes.\nStudents seeking to earn a bachelor’s degree from the University of Wisconsin–Madison will apply for admission through the Office of Admissions and Recruitment. Undergraduate admission is competitive and selective; professional admissions counselors review applications using a holistic process. We focus on academic excellence, reviewing high school and college coursework (when applicable), the courses students have chosen to take, the rigor and breadth of the curriculum, and how the student has performed in their coursework. We also consider written essays, letters of recommendation, extracurricular involvement, and optional test scores.\nOur review process is designed to help us identify students who are not only academically stellar but also have qualities such as leadership, concern for humanity, and achievement in the arts, athletics, and other areas. We also seek diversity in personal background and experience for potential contribution to the University of Wisconsin–Madison community.\nWe invite and encourage all students considering the University of Wisconsin–Madison to join us on campus for a visit. There are many options to explore and discover what UW–Madison has in store.\nTo submit an application for admission, review the application dates and deadlines, as well as the required application materials listed on our website.\nDeadlines\nFirst-Year Applicants\nTransfer Applicants\nReentry Applicants\nSecond Degree Applicants\nCompetitive first-year applicants have taken advantage of the rigor offered at their high schools and have performed well in challenging courses. Beyond academic excellence, we are looking for students who demonstrate leadership, community engagement, and passion.\nStudents are considered first-year applicants if they have not yet completed high school (secondary-level education); have not earned a GED/HSED (but will by the time they enroll at UW–Madison); or have not enrolled in a college or university in a degree-granting program since graduating high school or earning a GED/HSED. For more information about admission requirements and expectations of first-year applicants, please see our website.\nSuccessful transfer applicants will have a consistently high or upward grade trend; a strong cumulative grade point average; and rigorous coursework in English composition, college-level math, science, social science, humanities, literature, and foreign language. Admission to the university does not guarantee acceptance to an intended major, which is a separate process from undergraduate admission.\nStudents are considered transfer applicants if they have enrolled in an accredited college or university in a degree-granting program after graduating from high school or earning a GED/HSED. Students must have 24 transferable credits earned at a college or university after high school graduation to be eligible for admission as a transfer applicant. For more information about admission requirements and expectations of transfer applicants, please see our website.\nProspective transfer students can begin satisfying UW–Madison general education and degree requirements before transferring. Transfer credit is generally given for college-level courses taken at a degree-granting institution accredited by a CHEA-recognized organization. Courses must be similar in nature, level, and content to UW–Madison undergraduate courses and apply to a UW–Madison academic program. Students may wish to consult the UW–Madison Transfer Credit Policy for more details.\nA transfer articulation agreement defines accepted transfer courses/credits between two institutions, promoting the successful transfer of completed coursework into UW-Madison required coursework.\nUW-Madison currently participates in two transfer articulation agreements with the Wisconsin Technical College System.\nStudents previously registered at UW–Madison in an undergraduate degree program who wish to resume undergraduate study after an absence of a semester or more are considered reentry students.

Click here to view the official policy in its entirety in the UW-Madison Policy Library.\nEach student comes to UW–Madison with a unique set of skills and academic preparation. To assess where each student stands in beginning to meet their General Education Requirements, placement tests provide academic advisors with the tools to help determine in which courses students should enroll. Placement tests are required of all incoming first-year and some transfer students.  Transfer students may be exempt from placement testing based on their transfer credit. Other exams such as ACT, SAT, SAT II, TOEFL, Advanced Placement (AP), International Baccalaureate (IB), etc. do not satisfy the requirement of placement tests, however, scores on these exams may assist in appropriate course enrollment advising.\nUW System Placement tests are developed by faculty and instructional staff from various UW System campuses and led by Testing and Evaluation Services (T&E). T&E conducts studies to support the development of these tests and effectively uses the results to place incoming students into appropriate levels of English, math, Spanish, French and German. Outlined below are the situations typical for requiring placement tests.\nA first-year student with previous experience in French, German, or Spanish or a transfer student without transfer credit in the language who plans to enroll in one or more of these languages must take a placement test to qualify for enrollment in courses beyond the entry level language course. If you are interested in taking a course in another language, see the available Departmental Placement Exams below. Previous experience may include native speakers and those who have previous coursework in the language.\nNote: If your score is between 0-149 or 851-999, please consult the German advisor. These scores are not valid, and something was entered incorrectly on your record.\nNote: If your score is between 0-149 or 851-999, please consult the Spanish advisor. These scores are not valid, and something was entered incorrectly on your record.\nThis test is required for students admitted to undergraduate degree granting programs who is:\nIt is assumed that a transfer student with one of the direct equivalent MATH courses in progress at the time of admission will successfully complete the course, and will not be required to take the placement test. If the student does not complete or pass the course, the student may be required to take the placement test to demonstrate minimum math proficiency.\nFor more detailed information on math course sequencing and placement, please see the information available on the Math Department website. Students should discuss course selection based on math placement test scores with an advisor if they have any questions.\nThere are two tests used to determine the placement of a student into courses focused on the development of skills needed for success in college-level communications:\nThis test is required for a student admitted to undergraduate degree-granting programs who is (one of the following):\nNote: If your score is 0 or between 851-999, please consult your advisor. These scores are not valid, and something was entered incorrectly on your record.\nThis test is required for an undergraduate student who must submit a Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), International English Language Testing System (IELTS) or Duolingo English Test (DET) score for admission to UW-Madison.\nFirst-year applicants educated in non-English speaking countries must submit an official TOEFL, IELTS, or DET score, unless English was the primary language of instruction in all four years of secondary school. Transfer applicants may have the test waived if English was the primary language of instruction in all four years of secondary school or a college-level English composition course was successfully completed at an accredited U.S. institution. This requirement will not be waived for Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or A-level scores.\nThe MSNESLAT is designed to evaluate English language proficiency, and to place a student into English as a Second Language courses that focus on written and spoken English used in academic contexts. A student who takes the MSNESLAT and obtains a score of less than 99 (Exempt) must satisfy the university’s expectation of college-level English language proficiency by completing ESL 118   Academic Writing II.\nNote: If your score is between 1-98 or 119-999, please consult your advisor. These scores are not valid, and something was entered incorrectly on your record.\nAcademic units that offer a sequence of courses may choose to propose and offer a placement test to determine which course in the sequence is an appropriate starting point for an individual student.\nUndergraduates at UW-Madison who have gained prior knowledge in a language other than English may be eligible to earn retrocredits. To earn these credits, students must take a language course at UW-Madison above the first-semester level in which they have some proficiency.\nThe course must be designated with the Foreign Language attribute of 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th semester language course and must be the first course in that language taken by the student after graduating from high school. Students interested in taking one of these courses may need to take a placement test and should consult with a language advisor at SOAR.\nTo be eligible, students must enroll in the language course prior to earning 30-degree credits and earn a grade of B or better. While transfer credits are included in the 30 credits, credits earned by students admitted as first-year students who took college level credits while in high school are not included. Test and other credit such as AP, CLEP or retrocredits from another language are also not included.\nNative speakers of a language are not eligible to earn retro credits in that language.\nUW–Madison honors retro credits earned at previous UW institutions if the student enrolled in the course prior to earning 30 credits and earned a grade of B or better.\nUW–Madison offers degree credit for Advanced Placement (AP) Exams. AP exams must be taken before graduation from high school or obtaining an equivalent credential. Students who receive credit for a particular course through AP and take the same course at UW–Madison will not receive degree credit twice; however, the grade in the UW–Madison course will be included in the overall grade point average.\nA maximum of 9 credits will be awarded between AP Calculus AB, AB Subscore, and BC.\nStudents may earn credit for either AP Physics 1 or AP Physics C Mechanics. Students may also earn credit for either AP Physics 2 or AP Physics C Electricity and Magnetism.\nUW–Madison offers degree credit for International Baccalaureate Higher Level (IB) Exams. IB Higher Level exams must be taken before graduation from high school or obtaining an equivalent credential. Students who receive credit for a particular course through IB and take the same course at UW–Madison will not receive degree credit twice; however, the grade in the UW–Madison course will be included in the overall grade point average.\nStudents who receive an IB Diploma with a minimum score of 28 are eligible for 3 additional elective credits.\nThe Math and Math with Further Math IB exams have been discontinued and are no longer being offered. Credit will still be given for these exams.\nAdvanced Level examinations, or A-Levels, are a key aspect of the British education system, serving as subject-specific qualifications usually taken by students in the final two years of secondary education. These exams are highly regarded internationally for their academic rigor. Credit is earned from A-Levels exams with grades ranging from A to E. Advanced Subsidiary (AS) Levels are not eligible for credit.\nThe UW-Madison credit earned from A-Level exams is determined by faculty review. For A-Level exams not listed in our current table, students can seek credit evaluation. In these instances, they are advised to contact the Office of the Registrar Credit Evaluation Services to begin the faculty review process, which may lead to credit approval for these additional exams.\nThe College-Level Examination Program (CLEP) allows students who have gained college-level knowledge outside the classroom to take examinations for possible college credit. To qualify for credit, students achieve a minimum score of 65 and take their CLEP examination before they accumulate 16 semester credits post-graduation from high school or after obtaining an equivalent credential.\nThe following credits are excluded from the 16-credit limit for CLEP eligibility:\nThis is a summary of the Credit by Exam policy.

All schools and colleges at UW-Madison use DARS to audit the progress of most undergraduate degree programs and certificates.\nDARS reports indicate which requirements are completed, which are complete with in-progress and planned courses, and which remain unsatisfied. For most undergraduate programs, DARS is the tool used to determine completion of the program and/or eligibility to graduate.\nStudents can request and review their DARS via the Course Search & Enroll app. They should contact their assigned advisor(s) for help reading and interpreting their DARS report.\nThe Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC) prepares students to become commissioned officers in the U.S. Air Force, Army, Navy, or Marines, as well as for civilian careers. Students may be enrolled in ROTC while pursuing a degree at UW–Madison. ROTC courses are open to all undergraduates who have met the prerequisites. The number of ROTC credits that count toward a UW–Madison degree can vary by department and school or college. Prospective and registered students should contact the military program offices listed in this section of the catalog for information about regular course offerings, summer camp programs, and scholarships.\nThe Air Force ROTC (AFROTC) program is the primary path available to enter the U.S. Air Force or U.S. Space Force as an officer. Students enroll in the AFROTC program while working toward a bachelor's degree in any major they choose. They attend an aerospace studies class each semester, a hands-on leadership laboratory, and weekly physical fitness sessions, while learning about how the Air Force and Space Force work and deciding which job fields match their interests. Upon graduating, they enter active duty service as second lieutenants, in leadership and management roles in the Air Force or Space Force.\nMost career fields have an active-duty commitment of four years after college. If students choose to separate from the Air Force or Space Force at that time, they can pursue other careers with experience and the distinction of \"military officer\" on their resumes.\nAFROTC is designed for students with three or more years remaining until graduation. To receive an officer's commission, AFROTC cadets must complete all necessary requirements for a degree as well as courses specified by the Air Force.

It offers the opportunity to earn a commission as a Second Lieutenant for Active Duty, Army Reserve, or Army National Guard while pursuing an academic degree. It enables young men and women to prepare themselves to be leaders in the Army or the civilian career field of their choice. The traditional four-year Army ROTC Program is divided into a two-year Basic Course and a two-year Advanced Course. A non-contracted student enrolled in the Basic Course does not incur a military service obligation. All Military Science classes are taught in person on campus.\nThis instruction introduces the student to fundamental military and leadership subjects. It is normally taken over four successive semesters, but may be completed in as few as two semesters. Students should discuss available options with the Scholarship & Enrollment Officer before registering for courses if they have fewer than four semesters to complete the Basic Course.\nThe regular curriculum consists of a lecture and lab each semester. Freshmen are encouraged to take our class and lab with no military obligation. Students can enroll in a lecture without enrolling in the lab, but cannot enroll in a lab without the corresponding lecture. Labs are intended to provide practical leadership experience and military skills training such as map reading, land navigation, field training, and rifle marksmanship. Additionally, students who start in the Aerospace Studies or Naval Science programs can switch to Military Science and continue on toward graduation with no penalty.\nStudents who have completed the Basic Course or an equivalency (see Two-Year Program) and have passed all enrollment eligibility criteria continue on into the Advanced Course. This course consists of the following lectures, leadership labs, a separate military history course, physical fitness training sessions, and a four-week paid leadership capstone (Advance Camp) at Fort Knox, Ky. Students normally attend Advance Camp between their junior and senior years of Military Science. During labs and physical training sessions students are provided practical leadership opportunities to prepare them for Advance Camp and their future military careers. Students must complete all components of this course to earn a commission.\nCadets are to take and pass one history course that meets the ROTC Military History requirement for commissioning:\nStudents who are veterans, members of the Army National Guard/Army Reserve, or who have participated in the Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps Program in high school may qualify for direct entry into the Advanced Course. Students who did not complete the ROTC Basic Course (see above), to include graduate and doctoral students, but have two years of academic study remaining may be eligible to attend Basic Camp. This option compresses the Basic Course curriculum into a paid four-week summer leadership professional development course held at Fort Knox, KY prior to starting the Advanced Course. Students who believe they qualify for this program should consult with the Scholarship & Enrollment Officer for more information.\nQualified students may compete for Army ROTC scholarships ranging from two to three years in duration. High school students can apply for a four year scholarship during their senior year of high school. Students must be enrolled and participating in Army ROTC to be eligible for scholarships. Scholarships are merit based and pay full tuition & fees (both in and out-of-state) or room and board (capped at $6,000/semester) but not both, $600/semester for textbooks and laboratory expenses, and a tax fee subsistence stipend of $420 for each month of the regular school year. Interested students should consult with the Scholarship & Enrollment Officer for more detailed information concerning the scholarship eligibility requirements. For additional information about Army ROTC, students may contact Craig Giese in the Department of Military Science, 1910 Linden Drive, 608-262-3411, armyrotc@mailplus.wisc.edu.\nThe Naval ROTC Program was established to develop future officers mentally, morally and physically and to instill in them the highest ideals of duty, and loyalty, and with the core values of honor, courage and commitment in order to commission college graduates as Naval officers who possess a basic professional background, are motivated toward careers in the Naval service, and have a potential for future development in mind and character so as to assume the highest responsibilities of command, citizenship and government.\nThe purpose of the Naval ROTC Program is to educate and train qualified young men and women for service as commissioned officers in the Navy's unrestricted line, and the Marine Corps. As the largest single source of Navy and Marine Corps officers, the Naval ROTC Scholarship Program plays an important role in preparing mature young men and women for leadership and management positions in an increasingly technical Navy and Marine Corps.\nSelected applicants for the four-year Naval ROTC Scholarship Program are awarded scholarships through a highly competitive national selection process, and receive full tuition, books stipend, educational fees and other financial benefits. Upon graduation, midshipmen are commissioned as active duty officers in the Navy’s unrestricted line or the Marine Corps.\nThe four-year Naval ROTC Scholarship Program is available to qualified students who graduate from high school before August 1 of the year they intend to start college, and have earned less than 30 credit hours of college-level courses.\nStudents may affiliate with the Naval ROTC program, with the approval of the Professor of Naval Science, as College Program midshipmen, but receive none of the monetary benefits of scholarship students.  College program midshipmen may apply and compete for 3-, 2-, or 1-year NROTC scholarships in each of their freshman, sophomore and junior academic years.\nStudents selected for the Navy ROTC Scholarship Program make their own arrangements for college enrollment and room and board, and take the normal course load required by the college or university for degree completion.\nUpon graduation, midshipmen who complete all academic requirements in the Navy ROTC program are commissioned as an Ensign in the Navy or a 2nd Lieutenant in the Marine Corps and will be required to serve a minimum of five years of active military service. (Additional service requirements may apply for specific service assignments; e.g., pilot, nuclear power officer.)\nNavy Option\nMarine Option\nA significant portion of a midshipman's professional training during their four-year curriculum is received during summer training.\nNavy option midshipmen attend summer training, to include Career Orientation and Training for Midshipmen (CORTRAMID) for rising sophomores, and Fleet Exposure Cruises for rising juniors and seniors.\nMarine Corps option summer training includes Career Orientation and Training for Midshipmen (CORTRAMID) for rising sophomores, and Fleet Exposure Cruises for rising juniors. All rising senior Marine option midshipmen attend the 6-week Marine Corps Officer Candidates School in Quantico, VA.\nMidshipmen must ultimately make decisions as to which warfare area they will request to be commissioned into; CORTRAMID and the various summer training programs are designed to instill awareness of these areas and provide midshipmen with the background necessary to make informed decisions regarding their career choice. Midshipmen select their order of preference of available warfare communities and are ultimately assigned based on their class rank and the needs of the Navy and Marine Corps.\nAir Force ROTC—Aerospace Studies: Lieutenant Colonel Scott Gross, Professor of Aerospace Studies/Department Chair/Detachment Commander; Major Jeremy Ware, Assistant Professor of Aerospace Studies/Recruiting Officer; Major Ryan Hansen, Assistant Professor of Aerospace Studies/Education Officer; Captain Kaitlynn Williams, Assistant Professor of Aerospace Studies/Operations Flight Commander.\nMilitary Science—Army ROTC: Please refer to our website for current cadre and staff.\nNaval Science—Professor, CAPT Barnett; Associate Professor, CDR Mascotti; Assistant Professors LCDR Adam Stroik, LT Michael Breslin, and Marine 1st Lt.

Tied to the Wisconsin Idea and steeped in our long-standing institutional values—the commitment to the truth, shared participation in decision-making, and service to local and global communities—the Wisconsin Experience describes how students develop and integrate these core values across their educational experience.\nThrough the Wisconsin Experience, our students will engage in the following areas of intellectual and personal growth.\nEmpathy and Humility\nRelentless Curiosity\nIntellectual Confidence\nPurposeful Action\nStudent engagement and activism are deeply rooted in UW–Madison’s rich history of academic and research excellence. Occasionally, students are expected to help the university better understand and improve student learning by participating in evaluative activities, which include surveys, focus groups, and questionnaires, and by providing examples of their work through presentations, posters, demonstrations, and writing samples. We rely on the student perspective when assessing the effectiveness of academic and co-curricular programs. By participating, students help improve their own educational and related experiences and contribute to better educational experiences for future students.\nUW–Madison offers students many ways to enrich their academic program, regardless of the major field of study they choose to pursue. Engaging in research, studying abroad, being part of learning communities, participating in university honors, becoming a student leader, engaging in service learning—these are all vital components that enhance and strengthen classroom learning. This partnership between in- and out-of-classroom learning form the foundation of the Wisconsin Experience. The university encourages students to take advantage of opportunities to integrate their learning experiences.\nHonors programs, which vary slightly among the schools and colleges, are designed for students who wish to undertake work that is more intensive than regular coursework. High grade point averages are required to maintain honors student standing. Students should refer to Honors Programs for more information including specific school or college programs or to contact an honors advisor.\nOne of the most exciting things in life is to discover something new. UW–Madison provides unique opportunities to learn from and work with some of the world’s leading researchers and scholars. Options range from assisting with professors’ ongoing research to designing and directing one's own projects. For many examples, see Undergraduate Research Opportunities. The Undergraduate Research Scholars Program is one opportunity available in the first or second year of study. Students may cap off their undergraduate degree with a senior thesis or senior honors thesis and are encouraged to present their work at the Undergraduate Symposium. For program descriptions, see Undergraduate Symposium. For a sampling of the many grants and awards available to support and honor this work, visit the Undergraduate Academic Awards Office.\nUndergraduates have access to more than 100 community-based learning courses each year. These courses emphasize hands-on experiences that address real-world issues as a venue for educational growth.

Each year UW–Madison sends more than 2,500 students on study abroad programs around the globe, including international internships and domestic study away options within the United States.\nInternational Academic Programs (IAP) serves as the central study abroad office on campus, offering more than 300 programs in over 80 countries around the world. IAP program offerings, available to all majors for students at all levels, range from short-term faculty-led opportunities to intensive language study, internships, a semester or a year at a university abroad, service-learning, and programs with special themes. Students can visit the Study Abroad Resource Center, 301 Red Gym, to meet with advisors who can help students prepare and research study abroad options.\nAdditionally, in partnership with IAP, the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences, the College of Engineering, and the School of Business offer programs geared specifically for their academic disciplines. All approved UW–Madison programs share policies, procedures, and best practices, and are featured on the Program Search page.\nEmployers are increasingly looking for workers who not only have technical knowledge, but also “soft skills” such as critical thinking, problem solving, time management, and communication skills deemed necessary for success in a global workforce. Study abroad is one of the best ways students can acquire global skills and stand out to potential employers. Study abroad alumni have better job prospects. Based on a survey conducted by IES Abroad, 90 percent of study abroad alumni found their first job within six months of graduation. In addition to being able to experience new customs, cultures, interests, and food, alumni have reported that study abroad increased their confidence and had a lasting impact on their worldview.\nRegardless of major, students will find that study abroad has much to offer. The variety of program sites and durations (semester, spring break, summer, winter, year) allow students to select programs based on individual academic interests and personal goals and objectives.\nIn general, credits earned abroad can count toward fulfilling college and major requirements in any UW–Madison school or college. Seniors in most schools and colleges who complete their major and degree requirements while abroad on a UW–Madison program can graduate at the end of their study abroad program. Seniors who wish to graduate abroad should work closely with their academic advisors to ensure all degree requirements will be met.\nEach study program has its own eligibility requirements. Students are encouraged to talk with their academic advisors early in their academic careers about how study abroad can fit into their academic plans and future career goals. We are also working with departments to create Major Advising Pages to highlight programs that work best for students' degree plans.\nStudents who are thinking about studying abroad or have already decided to do so may be concerned about how they will fund the experience. We frequently hear from students that the program cost is a primary factor in deciding whether they are able to pursue studying abroad. Instead of tuition, students pay a program fee to cover the actual costs of the experience, which is unique to each program. Programs vary widely in cost, so it is likely that we have a program for every budget. Sometimes studying abroad is no more expensive than studying on campus, and other times the cost can be higher. We work with students to create funding plans for their time abroad.\nStudents who study abroad in UW–Madison-sponsored programs may be eligible to use federal financial aid toward the costs of the program. Students should meet with the UW–Madison Office of Student Financial Aid to discuss eligibility requirements. In addition, students can apply for scholarships specifically designated for use with study abroad programs. These include UW–Madison, national, and international scholarship opportunities. Students can also use most campus and academic department scholarships for UW–Madison-sponsored study abroad programs and should talk with their scholarship sponsor about that.\nStudy Abroad staff are committed to providing quality study abroad and domestic study away programs for every UW–Madison student. We work strategically to identify, address, and remove barriers that may prevent participation and to provide a welcoming and inclusive environment for students. Our team actively engages with students, faculty, and staff from diverse backgrounds and prioritizes the continuous development of our knowledge and cultural competence. We also recognize the importance of increasing access to study abroad for historically underrepresented student populations. We are committed to diversity and inclusion so that every student can engage with and understand their identity through a new lens and continue to develop and make progress on their personal, professional, and academic goals.\nThis is a summary of the Requirements for Undergraduate Degrees policy. Click here to view the official policy in its entirety in the UW-Madison Policy Library.\nThe University of Wisconsin-Madison sets minimum standards that must be met by all students pursuing an undergraduate degree. The information in the following paragraphs provides general information about study at UW-Madison. Requirements may vary among the schools and colleges, and for specific programs. Students should learn about and understand the specific requirements for their program of study.\nTo receive a bachelor's degree from UW-Madison, students must earn a minimum of 120 degree credits (which includes AP, IB and other test credit, transfer credit, and retroactive credit). Requirements for some programs may exceed 120 degree credits. Students should consult with their college or department advisor for information on specific credit requirements. Undergraduate Majors.\nDegree candidates are required to earn a minimum of 30 credits in residence at UW-Madison. \"In residence\" means on the UW–Madison campus with an undergraduate degree classification. “In residence” credit also includes UW-Madison courses offered in distance or online formats, as credits earned in UW-Madison Study Abroad/Study Away programs. Some schools and colleges may have additional requirements concerning courses taken in residence; students should refer to the specific school or college section of the Guide or consult with an advisor.\nThis is a summary of the Undergraduate Major Declaration policy. Click here to view the official policy in its entirety in the UW-Madison Policy Library.\nUndergraduate degrees at UW-Madison presume that students are completing a program of study that consists of a degree program that combines the requirements for the degree with focused study in a discipline, or that combines school or collegewide requirements with an undergraduate major in which they pursue focused study. All undergraduates are expected to have declared or to have been admitted to their focused area of study by the end of the semester in which they have accumulated 86 credits. Students who have not met this expectation may be prevented from enrolling in future terms until they meet with their advisor. Some schools and colleges have additional requirements governing when majors may be declared; students should refer to the specific school or college section of the Guide and consult with an advisor about declaring their major.\nUndergraduate students must maintain the minimum academic thresholds, including the minimum grade point average specified by the school, college, or academic program to remain in good academic standing. Students whose academic performance drops below these minimum thresholds will be placed on academic probation.\nThis is a summary of the General Education Requirements policy. Click here to view the official policy in its entirety in the UW-Madison Policy Library.\nAll undergraduate students at UW-Madison must complete the university-wide General Education Requirements, which are designed to convey the essential core of an undergraduate education. This core establishes a foundation for living a productive life, being a citizen of the world, appreciating aesthetic values, and engaging in lifelong learning in a continually changing world. These requirements provide for breadth across the humanities and arts, social studies, and natural sciences; competence in communication, critical thinking, and analytical skills necessary for success in college and beyond; and investigation of the issues raised by living in a culturally diverse society. This core is intended to provide students with intellectual and practical skills, basic knowledge of human cultures and the physical world, strategies for understanding these topics, and tools intended to contribute to their sense of personal and social responsibility. General Education complements the work students do in their majors and degrees. Together, these requirements help students learn what they need to know not just for making a living, but also for making a life.\nCompleting the General Education Requirements is an important part of achieving these competencies, and to do so, students choose from many courses in communication, ethnic studies, quantitative reasoning, and breadth of study across disciplines in the natural sciences, humanities, literature, and arts, and social and behavioral sciences.\nEach school and college may choose to allow General Education courses to count toward other degree and/or major requirements. Students should always check with their advisors to discuss any additional degree requirements and determine if students are required to take specific General Education courses or to complete the requirements in a particular order. Students should review their Degree Audit (DARS) report to see how they are progressing toward fulfilling the General Education requirements. Please refer to this website for more information about the requirements.\nThe university-wide General Education requirements are:\nAll students must complete 13–15 credits of coursework intended to provide a breadth of experience across the major modes of academic inquiry. This requirement encourages students to adopt a broad intellectual perspective, to examine the world through investigative, critical, and creative strategies practiced in the natural (computational, biological, and physical) sciences, social and behavioral sciences, as well as in the arts and humanities.\nStudents acquire critical and creative thinking skills as well as enhance their problem-solving skills through a breadth of study across the humanities and arts, social studies, computational, biological sciences and physical sciences. In courses satisfying the Breadth requirement, students will:\nTo achieve these outcomes, students are required to complete courses in the following areas.\nThis requirement challenges students to understand that there are many ways to research, understand, communicate about, and interpret creatively the world around us. These \"ways of knowing\" intersect and overlap, and the ideas presented in one area will often inform and transform what students know and how they think about the others. Students develop skills that help them make informed decisions in a wide range of political, economic, and social contexts, to think critically about the world, to better understand their own and others' experience, and to behave in socially responsible ways. (For more information about how this exposure to breadth of inquiry and expression enriches students’ undergraduate experience and complements intensive study in the major, please see the General Education Requirements website.)\nThe Communication requirement helps to ensure that all graduates of UW-Madison acquire essential communication and research-gathering skills necessary for success in university course work and beyond. Communication-A (Comm-A) and Communication-B (Comm-B) courses train students to gather and assess information from a variety of sources and to present different kinds of information, insight, and analysis to diverse audiences. These courses are essential for students' career success and their preparation for public life in a rapidly changing world. While Comm-A courses focus exclusively on essential communication skills, Comm-B courses provide content instruction in a specific discipline and teach research, writing, and communication skills in conjunction with the course content. Comm-B courses are offered by departments across campus and vary widely in topic, content, and format.\nStudents develop skills that enable them to be effective communicators in and out of the classroom. In courses satisfying the Communication requirement, students will:\nTo achieve these outcomes, students must complete the following Communication requirements:\n2–3 credits at first-year level dedicated to reading, listening, and discussion, with emphasis on writing. While most incoming freshmen are required to complete coursework to fulfill this requirement, students may be exempted from Part A by approved college course work while in high school, AP test scores, or placement testing. Students are expected to satisfy this requirement by the end of their first year of undergraduate study.\nLearning Outcomes\n2–3 credits of more advanced coursework for students who have completed or been exempted from Part A. Students should consult with the appropriate undergraduate advisor about when this requirement should be completed. Courses that satisfy this requirement are offered in many fields of study; although a wide variety of courses fulfill this requirement, students are encouraged to select a course most in keeping with their interests or other requirements of their intended field(s) of study.\nLearning Outcomes\nPlease note: Because English is the language of instruction at UW–Madison, Communication A and B courses are taught in English, and student work in them is also completed in English.\nThe Ethnic Studies requirement is intended to increase understanding of the culture and contributions of persistently marginalized racial or ethnic groups in the United States, and to equip students to respond constructively to issues connected with our pluralistic society and global community. Because this increased understanding is expected to have a positive effect on campus climate, students are expected to complete this requirement within the first 60 credits of undergraduate study\nStudents draw connections between historical and present day circumstances and consider perceptions and cultural assumptions when examining questions and making decisions. In courses satisfying the Ethnic Studies requirement, students will:\nThe skills listed above apply to students' lives inside and outside the classroom, and by pursuing these objectives, students will further enhance their ability to participate in a multicultural society more effectively, respectfully, and meaningfully. Students complete this requirement by taking one course of at least 3 credits that is designated as an Ethnic Studies course.\nQuantitative Reasoning is the process of forming conclusions, judgments or inferences from quantitative information. The Quantitative Reasoning requirement at UW-Madison has two parts: Part A and B. Quantitative Reasoning A courses provide students with skills in mathematics, computer science, statistics or formal logic that are needed for dealing with quantitative information. The acquired skills are broad-based in order to have a positive impact on the readiness of students to take a Quantitative Reasoning B course in a variety of disciplines. Quantitative Reasoning B courses allow students to enhance their Quantitative Reasoning Proficiency in a more advanced setting, where they make significant use of quantitative tools in the context of other course material. To ensure timely completion of the undergraduate degree, students must demonstrate minimum math proficiency  before they can enroll in a Quantitative Reasoning Part A course. They  should complete Part A of the Quantitative Reasoning requirement by the end of their first year, and must complete Part A before they enroll in Part B.\nAn an introductory course in college-level mathematics, computer science, statistics, or formal logic that is intended to prepare students for more advanced work in a disciplinary context.\nQuantitative Reasoning Part A Requirement:\nCan be satisfied by approved college work while in high school, AP test scores, placement testing, or taking a 3-credit course at UW-Madison with a Quantitative Reasoning A designation.\nIn the disciplinary or interdisciplinary context of a course designed to build on the tools of college-level mathematics, computer science, statistics, or formal logic.\nQuantitative Reasoning Part B Requirement:\nCan be satisfied by taking a designated QR-B course of at least 3 credits in a variety of fields of study, which enhances students’ proficiency in this domain. Students are encouraged to select a course in keeping with their interests or to satisfy other requirements for their major or degree program.\nThe university offers hundreds of courses that meet the requirements described above. Students should consider their own interests and check with their advisor when deciding which courses to complete. Please note that many undergraduate programs of study have breadth requirements that go beyond these basic university-wide requirements.\nThe following language is used in the UW-Madison course listings to indicate how courses count toward satisfying the communication, quantitative reasoning, and ethnic studies portions of the General Education Requirements. Courses that satisfy these requirements are also tagged with a mortarboard (graduate cap) symbol. mortar board\nNote: Some Communication Part B courses carry Communication B credit only at the lecture or section level and/or only in certain semesters; these courses will be indicated in the Schedule of Classes.\nCourse descriptions also include information about whether courses meet General Education Humanities, Natural Science, or Social Studies Breadth Requirements. (Click on course numbers in the Guide to see this information.) Students should also be aware that each school and college may, at its own discretion, designate additional courses that satisfy these requirements. For this reason, students should consult their advisors to obtain information about how these requirements are implemented in the school or college in which they are enrolled.\nWhen students expect to graduate, they must indicate their intent by completing the graduation application available in the MyUW Student Center. It is the policy of UW-Madison that all work for the degree must be completed and all degree requirements satisfied before the degree can be conferred.\nWhen students have been certified as having completed all university general education, degree, and major requirements, the degree will be awarded. When the degree is awarded, a diploma will be issued, listing the degree earned, and the transcript updated to reflect the degree, major, and any other approved academic programs completed. Students who have holds on their records will not receive their diplomas, or be able to order transcripts, until the holds are cleared.\nStudents who wish to attend the spring or winter commencement ceremony must indicate their intent by completing the graduation application available via Student Center in MyUW by the posted deadline. Students may participate in the commencement ceremony, in which the chancellor and deans symbolically confer the degrees, even if all degree requirements have not been completed. Neither participation in the ceremony nor listing in the program conveys degree conferral. Students will not receive the diploma or transcript notation until all degree requirements are certified as complete by their respective school or college. Should a student’s graduation plans change, updates to the intended term of graduation must be indicated via the graduation application in the MyUW Student Center.\nThe Office of the Registrar is responsible for maintaining the academic records of students who attend the University of Wisconsin–Madison and for many services associated with these records, including enrollment and grading. The office is located at:\n333 East Campus Mall #11101\nMadison, WI 53715-1384\nregistrar@em.wisc.edu\n608-262-3811\nMany student services are available online in the Student Center on MyUW–Madison (MyUW), including viewing grades, ordering transcripts, and updating address and emergency contact information. Students are responsible for the accuracy of the addresses provided in MyUW and for the courses selected when they enroll.\nMyUW is available to eligible students, who gain access by using their Net ID and password from any device with internet access. For further information, see DoIT (Division of Information Technology).\nStudents enroll for courses, obtain information about deadlines, view their class schedule, and more in the Course Search & Enroll application on MyUW. Information about key deadlines and course enrollment are also available at the Office of the Registrar website. Additional assistance with the course enrollment process is available by calling 608-262-3811 or emailing registrar@em.wisc.edu.\nThe general quality of a student's work is expressed in terms of a grade point average (GPA). It is based on the total number of credits taken for which grades of A through F are received. Semester grades are reported by letter only; plus and minus signs are not authorized. The highest possible GPA is 4.0, representing A grades in every course; the lowest possible is 0.0. The following is the official scale of grades at UW–Madison.\nExcluded from the GPA calculation are:\nS or U (Satisfactory or Unsatisfactory) in courses taken on the pass/fail basis.\nSD/UD (Satisfactory-Disruption/University Disruption-No Credit): special grading option for students in response to the COVID-19 events.\nS/M/U (Satisfactory/Marginal/Unsatisfactory) in courses offered only through the School of Veterinary Medicine.\nCr or N (Credit or No Credit) in courses offered on a credit/no credit basis.\nDef (Deferred), Ex (Excused), PE (Permanently Excused), formerly used only for required Physical Education. The Physical Education requirement was discontinued effective August 30, 1976.\nDR (Dropped), indicates the course was dropped.\nI (IN for Cr/N Courses) (Incomplete), a temporary grade used when work is not completed during a term.\nEI (Extended Incomplete), a temporary grade for an extended time limit to remove an Incomplete.\nPI (Permanent Incomplete), a permanent grade replacing an Incomplete incurred in a student’s last semester in residence and not removed within five years.\nNR (No Report), indicates that a grade was not submitted by the instructor. Has no net effect on GPA. Effective Summer 1999.\nNW (No Work)…”should be used for students who enroll in a course and then never attend. ‘No Work’ in this context means that the instructor has no evidence that the student ever attended, in that no course work was ever submitted. Any student who does attend for part of the semester, and then stops participating should be given a grade of ‘F’ unless there are grounds for assignment of a grade of ‘I'(Incomplete).” Fac. Doc. 1028; effective 9/94.\nP (Progress), a temporary grade used for courses extending beyond one term. The final grade determines the grade for each term and replaces P grades for the course.\nQ (Question on Credits or Honors), a temporary grade used during grade reporting to indicate a credit problem. Should only be used when the student is enrolled for the wrong number of credits or their honors indication is incorrect. A Q grade may be represented on a grade report as “?”.\nR (Registered), not used after the Summer 1974.\nW (Withdrew), indicates the student withdrew from the University while enrolled in the course.\nAudited courses, denoted as such by ‘AU’ in place of a number of credits, are graded either S (Satisfactory) or NR (No Report).\nSome courses are designated as being offered on a Credit/No Credit basis. The transcript for the course will indicate either CR, meaning the student earned the credits for which the course was offered, or N, meaning that the student did not earn any credit even though enrolled for the course. Students may not take such courses on any other basis.\nThis policy concerns the use of the pass/fail grading option for degree-seeking undergraduate students. According to the UW–Madison grading scale, grades of S (satisfactory) and U (unsatisfactory) are the transcripted grades that are used for what is commonly known as pass/fail. It applies only to courses that use the default A–F grading scale and that also allow students to choose to take a course on a pass/fail (PF) basis.1\nThe instructor enters the letter grade earned by students on the grade roster, and those letter grades are subsequently recorded as a pass (S) or fail (U) on the student record. A pass (S) will be recorded when a letter grade of A through C is earned. A fail (U) will be recorded when a letter grade of D or F is earned. In addition to the S or U notation, the student transcript includes the symbol # for courses that were taken on a pass/fail basis. Neither the S nor the U is used in computing the grade point average. Instructors are not informed that a student has elected to take the course pass/fail.\nStudents must be in good academic standing according to their school/college in order to be eligible to request the pass/fail grading option.\nUndergraduates may carry one course on a pass/fail basis per term and a maximum of 16 credits during their undergrad career. The summer sessions collectively count as a single term.\nRequired courses cannot be taken on a pass/fail basis.  The student’s school or college may review the request to take a course pass/fail and reject requests for nonelective work. It may be difficult for the school or college official to determine whether a course is an elective or being used to fulfill a requirement since a student’s enrollment or the way a course is being used in the specific program of study may change. Ultimately it is the student’s responsibility to be sure that the requested course is an elective. Students are strongly advised to consult with an academic advisor before taking a course pass/fail. Courses taken on a pass/fail basis will not count for nonelective requirements even if they would normally count toward such requirements.\nEach school or college is responsible for clearly communicating to its students what the definition of “good academic standing” is and what a free elective is.\nIn each school or college, the office responsible for academic policy exceptions is authorized to make exceptions to the pass/fail policy.\nStudents indicate that they would like to have a course they are enrolled in graded on a pass/fail basis by completing a course change request via their Student Center (see Course Change Request for detailed information). Students may submit pass/fail requests via their Student Center from the time that they enroll until midnight on the Friday at the end of the fourth week of fall and spring semesters. (For modular and summer session courses, pass/fail requests must be submitted by midnight Friday of the week in which the session is one-fourth completed).\nThe deadline for requesting the pass/fail grading option is posted on the Office of the Registrar website. These deadlines are based on the idea that the pass/fail option is intended to encourage students to explore educational opportunities that they might otherwise not be willing to attempt. Pass/fail is not intended as a way for students to avoid academic consequences.\nOnce the student has submitted the request to take a course on a pass/fail basis the request is routed via Student Information System workflow to an academic dean in the school or college for approval or further communication with the student.  The school/college official must approve the request before the grading option is changed to pass/fail by the Office of the Registrar.\nStudents can see whether a course is being graded on a pass/fail basis in the MyUW Student Center's Academic Records > View Grades section.\n1 For study abroad programs operated by the College of Engineering, courses taken abroad toward an engineering major will be posted as pass/fail. This occurs automatically and is not a student option; this practice is not covered or affected by this policy.\nEvery course grade of F counts as 0 grade points and remains permanently on the transcript. If the course is repeated, the original F will remain on the transcript and will be included in computing the GPA.\nThis is a summary of the Undergraduate and Special (Nondegree) Student Lapsed Incomplete Grades policy. Click here to view the official policy in its entirety in the UW-Madison Policy Library.\nA grade of Incomplete may be assigned to a student who, because of illness or another unusual and substantiated cause beyond their control, is unable to complete the coursework.\nTo be eligible for an Incomplete grade, the student must:\nThe student must initiate the request for a grade of Incomplete with the instructor before the end of the term. The instructor and student must agree on the coursework to be completed and establish a plan for the work to be submitted by the student, and the instructor-assigned grade change to be entered in the student information system and updated on the student record prior to the deadlines below.\nIf the Incomplete grade is not changed to a final grade by the Friday of the eighth week deadline, the Incomplete grade will be changed (lapsed) to a grade of F or N (for Credit/No Credit courses).\nIf the outstanding work is unable to be completed by the deadline due to additional extenuating circumstances, the instructor may extend the time the student has to complete outstanding work by submitting a request to change the Incomplete grade to a grade of Extended Incomplete (EI).\nA graduating student with an Incomplete grade must complete all coursework before their degree can be awarded. The completion of coursework after the intended term/semester of graduation means that a student will be awarded their degree at the next official conferral date.\nStudents may audit eligible courses with instructor and academic dean consent if no laboratory or performance skills are involved. Auditors may not recite or take examinations but are expected to attend classes regularly and do some assigned work. Although courses for which students enroll as an auditor are factored into tuition, such courses do not earn academic credit and do not count in determining full-time/part-time load for enrollment certification in an academic term. Students initiate a request to audit by completing a course change request via Student Center (see Course Change Request for detailed information). Students may submit audit requests via Student Center from the time that they enroll until midnight on the Friday at the end of the fourth week of fall and spring semesters. (For modular and summer session courses, audit requests must be submitted by midnight Friday of the week in which the session is one-fourth completed). School and college policies may vary from this description. Students are advised to consult with the instructor concerning specific course requirements that must be satisfied.\nStudents are classified by year according to the number of credits they have earned:\nFreshman: fewer than 24 credits\nSophomore: 24-53 credits\nJunior: 54-85 credits\nSenior: 86 or more credits\nThe UW System Board of Regents sets tuition and fee rates annually. Rates are subject to change without notice.\nThe tuition and fee schedule is available on the Bursar's Office website. Students whose first enrollment for the term is after the first Friday of the official first week of classes are assessed a late initial enrollment fee. Exception: Special and Guest students have until the Friday of the second week of classes to enroll.\nEnrolled students can view account charges/payments, financial aid (loans, grants, scholarships) received, and refunds on their MyUW Student Center, Financial Account. Students can also access links to view and pay student account eBills, set up Authorized Payers for account access, and enroll for eRefund.\nThe Bursar’s Office provides the student account bill electronically (eBill). The eBill is published on the MyUW Student Center payment portal. Students and their Authorized Payers receive an email when the eBill is available to view.\nFor questions about tuition rates, student account activity and billing questions, contact the Bursar's Office.\ntuition@bussvc.wisc.edu (include student ID and name)\n608-262-3611\n333 East Campus Mall #10501\nMadison, WI 53715-1383\nStudent Account payment options include making an online ePayment, mailing a check to the Bursar's Office, or placing a check in the first-floor lobby dropbox. For detailed payment information, see Payment Methods on the Bursar's Office website.\nIf the balance is not paid by the due date, a late fee is assessed and a hold is placed to prevent future enrollment until the account is paid.\nAt the University of Wisconsin-Madison, residence for tuition determinations are governed by Wisconsin Statutes 36.27(2). The standards to qualify as a Wisconsin resident are unique to this law and may differ from standards used to determine residency for other purposes, such as voting, paying taxes, obtaining licensures, and other forms of residency. In general, eligibility for resident status requires that an independent student (or the student’s parent, if the student is a dependent) must demonstrate bona fide residency in Wisconsin for at least twelve months immediately prior to enrollment for any term. However, the law also states that individuals who come to Wisconsin primarily for educational purposes do not qualify as Wisconsin residents for tuition purposes, even if they meet the remaining eligibility criteria. As a result, students who begin their enrollment as nonresidents usually maintain nonresident status for the duration of their enrollment.\nWhile all individuals who do not demonstrate eligibility under Wisconsin Statutes 36.27(2) will be classified as nonresidents, the law does provide a limited set of exceptions to twelve-month period normally required to establish bona fide residency. These exceptions pertain to some (but not all) individuals who are refugees in Wisconsin, who have certain military or veteran statuses, or who have relocated to Wisconsin for full-time, permanent employment under certain conditions. If you have questions about whether your circumstances might align with the exemptions noted here, you may wish to contact a residence specialist to discuss your residency further.\nFor more information and the full text of Wisconsin Statutes, Section 36.27(2), see the Office of the Registrar website or contact a residence specialist at 608-262-1355 or ResidenceForTuition@registrar.wisc.edu.\nNonresident students who plan to use federal veteran benefits such as the post-9/11 GI Bill may be eligible for resident tuition rates even though they are formally classified as nonresidents of Wisconsin. If you plan to use veteran benefits while enrolled at UW-Madison, you may wish to speak with University Veterans Services at 608-265-4628 or veterans@wisc.edu for more information about how to use your military benefits at the University.\nMinnesota residents who are certified by the Minnesota Office of Higher Education for the appropriate term to attend UW–Madison under the Minnesota–Wisconsin Tuition Reciprocity Agreement will be assessed the approved reciprocity tuition rate, plus the segregated fees assessed to all UW–Madison students. Students under this program will be classified as nonresidents of Wisconsin. Minnesota residents must apply to the Minnesota Office of Higher Education for verification of their eligibility for reciprocity.\nTo learn more about eligibility, application procedures, and deadlines, visit the UW-Madison Minnesota Reciprocity website.

Students are also responsible for conducting themselves in a manner compatible with membership in the university and local communities.\nUWS Chapters 17 and 18 of the Wisconsin Administrative Code list the university policies students are expected to follow and describes the procedures used when students are accused of misconduct, including possible outcomes. Review the complete text of UWS Chapter 17; and additional information is on the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards website, or contact the office via phone at 608-263-5701 or conduct@studentaffairs.wisc.edu.\nAny student at UW-Madison who feels that they have been treated unfairly has the right to voice a complaint and receive a prompt hearing of the grievance. The basis for a grievance can range from something as subtle as miscommunication to the extreme of harassment.\nEach school or college has a procedure to hear grievances. Generally the process involves an informal attempt to solve the problem, if appropriate. If not, more formal proceedings can be undertaken until a resolution is reached. Advisors and school or college offices have detailed information. For assistance in determining options, students can contact the drop-in staff member within the Office of Student Assistance and Support at 608-263-5700, within Bascom Hall, Room 70, Monday–Friday, 8:30 a.m.–4 p.m.\nThe Office of Student Assistance and Support assists students with matters outside of the classroom. They assist with a variety of concerns and connecting students with resources on campus. A great place to start when you don’t know where to go.\nIf you need personal assistance or resources, staff members in the Office of Student Assistance and Support are available on a drop-in basis, Monday-Friday. Reach out if you are dealing with a financial crisis, sudden health issues, housing/food insecurity, or other sensitive situations.\nA student can seek help at many places on campus, for both personal and academic problems. For answers to general questions on many topics, a good place to start is Ask Bucky, which is an excellent general referral service.\nFor personal concerns, Mental Health Services, a unit of University Health Services, offers individual, group and couple counseling services. Experienced counselors, psychologists, and psychiatrists can assist students in addressing depression and managing anxiety, and in developing self-awareness and understanding, independence, and self-direction. Our experienced staff is committed to understanding and respecting every individual. Mental Health Services is located at 333 East Campus Mall; 608-265-5600. In addition, an on-call dean in Student Assistance and Judicial Affairs is usually available by telephone (608-263-5700) or on a drop-in basis (75 Bascom Hall) Monday–Friday, 8:30 a.m.–4:30 p.m. UHS also offers students at 24/7 crisis line for mental health support. 608-265-5600 (option 9).\nFor academic problems, many places can offer help. The student should first discuss the problem with the professor or TA. If the problem is not resolved at that time, the student can speak with an academic advisor or the chair of the department. If further assistance is needed, the student should contact one of the academic deans in the school or college.\nStudent Affairs at UW–Madison serves students in areas including health and well-being, identity and inclusion, leadership and engagement, and student advocacy. Its multiple departments collaborate broadly across the many programs and campus units that serve students, such as the Division of Diversity, Equity and Educational Achievement, International Student Services, and University Housing, to enhance UW–Madison as a welcoming and inclusive community for all students.\n4301 Student Activity Center\n333 East Campus Mall\n608-265-4276 (265-4ASM)\nEmail: info@asm.wisc.edu\nWeb: asm.wisc.edu\nFacebook: Associated Students of Madison\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/asmstudentgovt/\n137 Red Gym\n716 Langdon Street\nPhone: 608-265-3344\nEmail: LGBTQ@StudentAffairs.wisc.edu\nWeb: lgbt.wisc.edu\nInstagram: @UWGSCC\n702 West Johnson Street, Suite 2104\n608-263-2741\nEmail: mcburney@studentlife.wisc.edu\nWeb: mcburney.wisc.edu\nFacebook: McBurney Disability Resource Center\nText:  (608) 225-7956\n716 Langdon Street\n608-262-4503\nWeb: msc.wisc.edu\nFacebook: UW–Madison Multicultural Student Center\nInstagram: @UWMulticultural\n(formerly the Center for Leadership & Involvement)\nStudent Activity Center\n3rd Floor, 333 East Campus Mall\n608-263-0365\nWeb: soli.wisc.edu\nFacebook: facebook.com/UWSOLI\nTwitter: @UWSOLI\nInstagram: @uwsoli\nUniversity Club – 432 East Campus Mall\nPhone: 608-265-9019\nEmail: advisor@fsl.wisc.edu\nWeb: https://www.fsl.wisc.edu\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/fsl_uwmadison\nOffice of Inclusion Education\n716 Langdon Street, Office #123\nEmail: inclusioneducation@studentaffairs.wisc.edu\nWeb: http://inclusioneducation.wisc.edu\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/uw_inclusioneducation/\nThe Office of Inclusion Education elevates and prioritizes inclusion for all students at UW-Madison and provides:\n(formerly the Dean of Students Office)\n70 Bascom Hall\n500 Lincoln Drive\n608-263-5700\nEmail: osas@studentaffairs.wisc.edu\nWeb: osas.wisc.edu\n724 West Johnson\n608-263-5701 \nEmail: conduct@studentaffairs.wisc.edu\nWeb: conduct.students.wisc.edu\n(formerly the Center for the First-Year Experience)\n155 Middleton Building\n1305 Linden Drive\n608-263-0367 \nWeb: newstudent.wisc.edu\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/uwnewstudent/\n333 East Campus Mall\n608-265-5600\nEmail: uhs@uhs.wisc.edu\nWeb: uhs.wisc.edu\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/UHSMadison\nInstagram: @uhsmadison\n797 W.

Fees are covered in the FAQs.\nThe Wisconsin Public Records Law allows the university to charge a requester the actual, necessary, and direct cost to locate responsive records. Wis. Stat.§ 19.35(3)(c). In addition, the university may require prepayment of any fees if the total amount exceeds $5.00. Wis. Stat.§ 19.35(3)(f).\nAs required by the public records law, the university responds to records requests as soon as is practicable and without delay.\nTo view an example of a Public Records Request for personnel information, see (include link to an example request such as the one below).\nTo request public directory information, see (include link when automated system becomes available).\nAn appointment of a Teaching, Project or Research Assistant within an employing department shall be for a specific period, up to one year. The academic admitting graduate program may make financial support guarantees to employees for a period longer than one year, and such guarantees may include a variety of appointments, including, but not limited to, teaching, research, and project assistantships. Satisfactory academic progress as defined by the Graduate School and the graduate program handbook is required for reappointment.\nDepartments or graduate programs that employ Teaching, Project or Research Assistants shall establish criteria for use in making appointments to these titles. These criteria may include but are not limited to such factors as academic record, letters of recommendation, previous relevant experience, and factors related to the academic and research missions of the department.\nCopies of established criteria will be available on request to employees. Departments and graduate programs are strongly encouraged to also make this information available on their websites. It is important to note, the employing department is not necessarily the same as the graduate program.\nAll newly appointed employees shall receive a letter of appointment from the employing department which specifies the supervisor, appointment title, experience classification (if any), appointment percentage, effective dates, salary or stipend level, length of probationary period (if any), hours of work or work assignment if known, and for eligible employees notification that insurance including health insurance and other benefits may be available and have deadlines for enrollment; the letter will also indicate a person or office to contact for information regarding benefits associated with the appointment. Letters of appointment shall be delivered to the employee before the start of employment.\nIn addition, reappointed employees shall receive a letter of appointment from the employing department which specifies the supervisor, appointment title, experience classification (if any), appointment percentage, effective dates, salary level, and hours of work or work assignment if known.\nDuring a semester in an academic year, employees who hold appointments as Teaching Assistants or Project Assistants shall have appointments at a level totaling at least one-third time (33%), except as provided below. Total appointments for employees may be less than one-third time with the agreement of the employee. Such appointments will require approval by the Department and Dean/Director. Employees appointed on a temporary emergency basis and all hourly pay basis Project Assistants may be appointed at a level less than one-third time.\nDuring a semester in an academic year, employees who hold appointments as Research Assistants shall have appointments at a level totaling at least one-half time (50%)1 except as provided below. There may be extenuating reasons for RAs to be appointed less than 50%. Such appointments will require approval by the Department and Dean/Director.\nThe University will make information about openings and application procedures for Teaching Assistants or Project Assistantships available to ensure that all interested graduate students are given an opportunity to apply. Interested graduate students may follow up their interests at the department level.\nDepartments employing or anticipating the employment of Teaching Assistants or Project Assistants will maintain posted information as follows:\nEmployment information will be posted electronically in a location designated by the department and easily accessible to graduate students. The University will maintain a web site on which open positions shall be posted. Open positions do not include: positions reserved for guarantees of support and/or recruiting offers; reappointments (continuing positions); and positions that must be filled within seven (7) days for emergency purposes.\nTeaching Assistants may request assignment to particular courses, and when in the department’s judgment the Teaching Assistant is qualified to teach the course, the course supervisor is agreeable to the assignment, and the department can staff its courses in a manner which it deems satisfactory, the Teaching Assistant’s request shall be granted.\nDepartments shall notify appointed Teaching Assistants of their tentative course assignments, if known, no later than August 1 for fall semester courses and December 1 for spring semester courses. Such notification does not guarantee the assignment.\nIn assigning duties to Teaching Assistants or Project Assistants:\nThe department and supervising staff member shall establish the required duties of the employee and the supervising staff member shall discuss these duties with the employee at the beginning of the appointment period.\nIt is understood that Teaching Assistants and Project Assistants are engaged in professional activities of such a nature that the output produced or the result accomplished cannot be precisely measured in relation to a given period of time. In determining the amount of time expected for an employee assignment, consideration shall be given to such factors as type of instruction, number of students instructed, and all other factors, including those specific to the course or group of courses to which instructional duty expectations apply. Fluctuations above and below the hours reflected in the appointment level are expected, corresponding to individual distinctions such as experience. Recognizing that Teaching and Project Assistants are embarked on a program of career and professional development, employees are encouraged to discuss duties with the supervising staff member, at the outset of the appointment and as questions may arise during the appointment.\nIn the case of Teaching Assistants, each department shall provide the employee and their supervisor with an appointment worksheet with the appointment letter at least three (3) days before signed workload sheets are to be returned by the employee, prior to each term of appointment (Fall, Spring and Summer). Copies of these estimates shall be provided to course supervisors.\nIn addition, the employee and their supervisor will have an opportunity to review that worksheet at the commencement of the Teaching Assistant’s employment and throughout the semester. The worksheet shall indicate the approximate distribution of hours to be spent on the various duties required by the appointment and shall include hours for -mandated training time and for any training required by the University and deemed necessary for the performance of the employee’s duties.\nThe function of the aforementioned worksheet is advisory. Neither the specific distribution of hours among tasks on this worksheet, nor deviation from the apportionment of hours shall be construed as binding or grievable.\nDepartments are encouraged to establish workload committees consisting of faculty, staff and graduate students who are current or former Teaching Assistants or Project Assistants to review new and existing workloads for Teaching and Project Assistants annually, identify persistent workload problems and recommend remedies to the department. If a workload committee does not exist, one may be established at the request of a majority of the Departmental Teaching and Project Assistants.\nThe appointment level for Teaching Assistants or Project Assistants shall be based on the department’s determination of the amount of time it should normally take to perform the assigned duties including orientation and training. Satisfactory performance of these duties shall not require an effort exceeding three hundred and sixty (360) hours per semester for a halftime (50%) academic year pay basis appointment; one thousand and forty (1040) hours per year for a halftime (50%) annual pay basis appointment; eight hundred and sixty-seven (867) hours per ten-month period for a halftime (50%) ten-month pay basis appointment; or a proportional number of hours for other durations or percentages of appointment.\nAll Teaching Assistant or Project Assistant duties required by the supervising staff member or the department shall be fairly within the scope of employment and shall be included in the calculation of required hours.\nThe number of hours are stated for the full appointment period, but hours needed to carry out required duties may fluctuate over portions of the appointment period. As soon as the University becomes aware of substantial fluctuations which will occur the employee will be so notified. Except for full time (100%) appointments, if the University knew or should with the exercise of reasonable diligence have known of a substantial increase in the number of hours needed to carry out required duties during a particular period and did not so notify the employee, the employee shall not be required to work more than forty (40) hours in any one week.\nInformal discussion between a supervisor and an employee is likely to be the most effective way to resolve problems in assignment of duties. An employee who finds that the assigned duties appear to require more time than is allocated should immediately notify, and consult with, the supervisor or Department Chair (or designee), who shall reconsider the factors used to determine the amount of time expected. The supervisor and the department may direct either an adjustment in the duties or, pending approval of funding, an adjustment in the appointment level.\nAn employee may submit to the supervisor or Department Chair (or designee) a written request that the duties required be revised. A response shall be made within one (1) week of the written request unless the employee and the department mutually agree to a longer period. If the employee is dissatisfied with the response or no response is forthcoming, the employee may file a grievance. No such grievance will be considered unless there has been a prior written request to make an adjustment.\nA department or supervisor may establish reasonable prerequisites which a Teaching Assistant or Project Assistant must meet in order to hold a particular position and determine whether those prerequisites have been met before the Teaching or Project Assistant becomes eligible to perform those duties. Any prerequisites shall be posted along with the job opening. If a Teaching or Project Assistant requests to hold a position and has not met the prerequisites, the employee shall not be paid for time involved in meeting the prerequisites if the request is granted. If a Teaching or Project Assistant is assigned to a course which the employee has not requested and for which she or he does not meet the prerequisites, the employee shall be paid for the time which is necessary to satisfactorily meet those prerequisites.\nIn assigning activities to RAs, the nature of the work is different than TAs and PAs. RAs are typically not assigned specific duties2. RAs are working toward developing skills in their specific field, and therefore the nature of skills and rate of acquisition of these skills may vary greatly across disciplines and individuals. It is therefore not possible to establish blanket descriptions of duties for RAs that uniformly apply to all in the title.\nThe research assistant and supervising faculty/staff member shall collaboratively develop a research program plan. These research program plans are encouraged to be reviewed by the department chair, program chair, and/or thesis committee.\nIt is understood that RAs are engaged in professional activities of such a nature that the output produced or the result accomplished cannot be precisely measured in relation to a given period of time. Fluctuations above and below the hours reflected in the appointment level are expected. Recognizing that RAs are embarked on a program of educational, career and professional development, employees are encouraged to discuss both a plan of academic study as well as the research program plan with the supervising faculty/staff member, at the outset of the appointment and as questions arise during the appointment3.\nThe employee and their supervisor will have an opportunity to review expectations at the commencement of the RAs employment. The employee and their supervisor shall have periodic meetings to discuss research progress.\nThe function of the aforementioned expectation review is advisory. Neither the specific distribution of hours among tasks, nor deviation from the apportionment of effort shall be construed as binding or grievable.\nInformal discussion between a supervisor and an employee is likely to be the most effective way to resolve problems. Employees are also encouraged to consult their academic program director, handbook and/or thesis committee for additional guidance. An employee who finds that the research plan appears to require more time, involves inappropriate work duties or duties incommensurate with the activities, should consult with the supervisor, who shall reconsider the factors used to determine the expectations. The supervisor and/or the department/unit may adjust the activities.\nFor RA appointments the grievance/appeal procedure regarding the assigned activities is documented by the admitting program’s graduate program handbook. Additional resources may be available based on your employing unit or college. In the event a satisfactory resolution is not achieved, the RA can utilize the Graduate School appeal process.\nThe Department will provide appropriate resources and an adequate and safe work environment necessary for the performance of job responsibilities including access to an office or shared workspace in which to conduct their work. Examples include but are not limited to: access to a printer and copier, access to a computer or laptop, office/instructional supplies, software necessary for instructional tasks / job duties, a departmental mailbox, personal protective equipment, and access to equipment operation manuals, records of equipment safety inspection reports, appropriate lockout/tag out procedures, and hazardous chemical Safety Data Sheets (SDSs). If an employee believes that additional resources or facilities are needed to perform such duties, then they are encouraged to contact their immediate supervisor for the purpose of discussing such needs.\nDepartments are encouraged to consult with a representative group of Teaching or Project Assistants to determine what resources may be necessary for the performance of TA/PA job responsibilities. If the matter is not resolved to the satisfaction of the employee in a reasonable amount of time, then they may bring their concerns directly to the department chair/director.\nThe University will make a good faith effort to provide resources and facilities commensurate with job expectations. Departments will not require employees to pay for resources that the Department has determined are essential for instruction, research or other assigned work.\nThe University of Wisconsin–Madison is committed to creating an accessible and inclusive campus experience for all members of the campus community.\nEmployees seeking information regarding accommodations in their workplace should contact the Campus Disability Coordinator:\nADA Resources\nCampus Disability Coordinator\nEmployees seeking information regarding accommodations in their studies should contact McBurney Disability Resources Center.\nThe University is responsible for orientation, training, and evaluation of employees.

The parties encourage all schools and colleges, and/or programs, to hold training sessions.\nThe University orients and trains employees regarding appropriate safety and security precautions in a timely manner.\nDepartments and other appointing units are encouraged to review the training and orientation programs available to their Teaching, Project and Research Assistants, and to consult with employees in these groups about ways in which the effectiveness of these programs can be enhanced.\nColleges, Schools and Divisions that employ Teaching Assistants or Project Assistants are encouraged to hold training sessions before the fall semester.\nEach department that employs new Teaching Assistants in the fall and spring semesters shall provide training for them, either alone or in combination with other departments. The training shall consist of a minimum of eight (8) required hours designed to aid them in their teaching duties. At least two (2) of these hours of training must come during the semester. The content, design and emphasis of the training shall be determined by the department chair or designee(s). For the fall semester training, a written description of the program shall be available upon request. A Teaching Assistant may be exempted from attending these sessions by the decision of the department chair or designee(s), provided that the Teaching Assistant has previous post-secondary teaching experience. Departments may have more extensive training programs available for certain groups of Teaching Assistants.\nThe University conducts training workshops for Teaching and Project Assistants that will address diversity issues deemed by the University to be relevant to the activities of these employees within their employment with the University. These workshops will be developed in consultation with the campus Office of Equity and Diversity, Teaching Assistants and Project Assistants, and other appropriate offices. These workshops shall not count toward the eight (8) hours of training described above.\nEach employing unit shall establish an evaluation process to review performance of duties and ability. Employees shall be informed of the evaluation process and criteria for evaluation at the start of the period for which they are being evaluated.\nTeaching Assistant evaluations may include input from the following sources, but should not consist solely of student evaluations:\nPerformance will be reviewed at least once during the term of the appointment. Copies of written performance evaluation reports will be provided to employees. A copy of this report and any written evaluations will be given to the employee who will have the right to make a written response to be placed in their personnel file. Departments are encouraged to provide supervision and evaluation throughout the appointment period.\nIn the event review of Teaching Assistant or Project Assistant teaching performance includes a committee, the committee shall have a faculty majority; its membership may include employee representatives chosen by employees and may include other staff and students.\nIf student evaluations are part of the Teaching or Project Assistant evaluation process, employees will be notified at least forty-eight hours prior to distribution of student evaluation forms. Student evaluations may be part of the Teaching or Project Assistant evaluation process, but shall not be the sole method for evaluating Teaching Assistants.\nResearch Assistant performance should be evaluated at least annually. These evaluations should include input from 1 and 2, and may also include, but may not be based solely upon, input from 3,\nIf the evaluation process is implemented by a thesis committee, the composition of such committee shall be in accordance with established graduate program and Graduate School procedures.\nComments and data that evidence illegal discrimination shall be excluded from consideration, and the presence of such comments shall be considered in weighing the evaluation as a whole.\nSince RA appointments involve a combined academic and employment experience, there may be a separate academic evaluation made by the supervisor and/or enrolling graduate program. The research assistant and their supervisor should have periodic and ongoing conversations to discuss research progress.\nThe University of Wisconsin–Madison is committed to providing equal opportunity and equal access and to complying with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations and University of Wisconsin System and university non-discrimination policies and procedures, including Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, which prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability, and the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of age.\nThe University strives to provide a workplace and educational environment free from harassment.

Information regarding fees deduction can be found here:\nGraduate Assistant Payment of Segregated Fees Policy\nAt the beginning of each appointment period Employees will be credited with an allocation of sick leave time, regardless of appointment percentage. The number of hours credited to an employee’s sick leave allocation depends on the length of the appointment period as follows:\nUnused sick leave shall accumulate as described below from appointment period to appointment period only within the same department and in the same title. Sick leave shall be used in 15-minute increments for project assistants, and in one-hour increments for teaching and research assistants. At the beginning of each appointment period, the number of sick leave hours credited to the employee’s sick leave credit bank under 1, 2, and 3, above, shall be supplemented to the following extent by unused sick leave carried over from the employee’s immediate previous appointment:\nEmployees may use time in their sick leave bank for reasons including but not limited to: personal (physical or mental) illness, bodily injuries, maternity, or exposure to contagious disease: (1) which requires the employee’s confinement; or (2) which renders the employee unable to perform assigned duties; or (3) where performance of assigned duties would jeopardize the employee’s health or recovery.

Tasks which are irrelevant to the appointee’s academic program or repetitive beyond that which is necessary to achieve excellence in the activity are not appropriate for an individual appointed as a research assistant.\n3Sometimes research requires long and/or unusual hours to complete a task or to gain mastery of a technique.\n4For example, a Research Assistant appointed to an annual appointment at .50 FTE (or 50%) will earn 90 hours vacation per fiscal year.\nAny Employee who discusses, inquires about, or participates in the grievance procedure may do so openly and shall not be subject to intimidation, discipline, or retaliation because of such activity.\nA grievance is defined as, and limited to, a written complaint identifying an alleged violation of a specific employment provision(s) of the Graduate Assistant Policies and Procedures and remedy sought. Grievances may be filed by a Teaching, Project or Research Assistant. Academic-related grievances are pursued through processes described in graduate program handbooks with subsequent appeals following Graduate School policy. An employee who files a grievance is referred to as the grievant. A grievant is encouraged to discuss the complaint with their immediate supervisor as well as other campus resources (e.g. department chair, dean/director, human resources representative, etc.) prior to filing a grievance. The primary purpose of this procedure is to secure equitable solutions to the grievance(s) at the most immediate level possible.\nThe word “days” for the purpose of this article shall be working days and shall not include weekends, university holidays, spring recess or the period from the last day of exams of the fall semester to the first day of the next instructional period, or days in which the grievant is required to leave Madison for extended work-related purposes (e.g. field work or conferences).

The grievant cannot be compelled to meet without their representative, however it is the grievant’s responsibility to find representation that can meet within the allotted time frame.\nA grievant may consult with their representative regarding a grievance, or process a grievance, during working hours for a reasonable period of time, provided that this meeting does not interfere with scheduled work activities.\nGrievances should be presented as soon as reasonably possible, typically no later than sixty (60) days from the date the grievant first became aware of, or should have become aware of with the exercise of reasonable diligence, the cause of such grievance.\nSteps One and Two of the grievance procedure may be waived by mutual agreement.\nThe Grievant and representative (if chosen) shall have the right to file a grievance when any provision of these procedures are alleged to have been violated. Possible relief may include extending the grievance timeframe to ensure that these procedures are followed.\nGrievances may continue after graduation or voluntary separation. In cases of involuntary termination, grievances may be filed by former employees, but must adhere to the relevant timeline(s).\nReceipt of a grievance for purposes of meeting timeline requirements at each step is determined by the date stamp on the grievance form (if hand delivered), digital timestamp (if filed electronically), or envelope postmark (if delivered by U.S. Mail).\nGrievances not answered by the employer within the designated time limits in any step of the grievance procedure may be appealed to the next step within ten (10) days of the expiration of the designated time limits.\nThe grievant must file a written statement with the appointing department/unit chair/director or their designee specifying the grievant’s name, a clear and concise statement of the grievance and the issue(s) involved, the date(s) the incident or violation took place and the specific policy section or sections involved, and the relief sought, The grievance shall be signed and dated by the grievant(s) and representative (if any).\nWithin twenty (20) days of receipt of the written grievance, the department chair/director or designee will meet with the grievant and their representative (if chosen) to hear the grievance and will return a written answer to the grievant and their representative (if chosen) no later than ten (10) days after this meeting. This answer will include a copy of the grievance procedure appeal process timeline, a list of resources and relevant contact information of personnel hearing future steps.\nIf the decision in Step One is not accepted by the grievant, the grievant shall have 10 days from receipt of the answer in Step One to file an appeal with the appropriate appointing department/unit Dean/Director or designee. The Dean/Director or designee will meet with the grievant and their representative (if chosen) within twenty (20) days from receipt of the appeal of Step One and attempt to resolve the grievance. The Dean/Director or designee will provide the grievant and their representative (if chosen) with a written response to the grievance no later than ten (10) days after this meeting.\nIf the decision in Step Two is not accepted by the grievant, the grievant shall have 10 days from the receipt of the answer in Step Two to file an appeal with the Office of Human Resources (OHR), specifically the Office of Workforce Relations (OWR). The OHR-OWR office will meet with the grievant and their representative (if chosen) within twenty (20) days from receipt of the appeal of Step Two.\nThe OHR-OWR will provide a written decision to the grievant and their representative (if chosen), no later than ten (10) days after this meeting.\nGrievances that are not resolved under the foregoing procedure may be appealed to the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission (WERC) by the grievant within twenty (20) days from the date of the answer in Step Three. If an unresolved grievance is not appealed to the WERC within twenty (20) days of the final resolution of Step Three, it shall be considered terminated on the basis of the Third Step answer of the responding party without prejudice or precedent in the resolution of future grievances. The issue as stated on the Third Step grievance and any amendments made thereon, in writing, at the Third Step grievance meeting shall constitute the sole and entire subject matter to be heard by the WERC hearing examiner, unless the parties agree to modify the scope of the hearing. The WERC hearing examiner will be selected by mutual consent of both parties. If the parties have utilized mediation, no reference to mediation shall be admitted as evidence in the hearing.\nWhere two (2) or more grievances are appealed to the WERC by the same individual or regarding a substantially similar matter, an effort will be made by the parties to have the grievances heard by the same hearing examiner.\nThe University will bear the cost of the WERC hearing fees.\nThe hearing examiner shall not have jurisdiction or authority to add to, amend, modify, nullify, or ignore in any way the provisions of University Policy.\nThe decision of the hearing examiner will be forwarded to the Chancellor or Chancellor’s designee for review. The Chancellor or Chancellor’s designee shall release a decision either accepting, rejecting, or modifying the hearing examiner’s decision. The Chancellor’s decision will be final and binding on both parties.\nThe decision of the Chancellor or Chancellor’s designee will be rendered within thirty (30) days from receipt of the WERC’s decision. If no decision is made by the Chancellor or Chancellor’s designee within thirty (30) days, then the decision of the WERC becomes final.\nSettlement of grievances may or may not be retroactive as the equities of particular cases may demand. In any case, the maximum period of retroactivity allowed shall be a date not earlier than sixty (60) days prior to the date of initiation of the written grievance in Step One unless the circumstances of the case made it impossible for the employee to know they had grounds for such claim prior to that date, in which case the retroactivity shall be limited to a period of ninety (90) days prior to the date the grievance was initiated in writing.

The academic admitting graduate program may make financial support guarantees to employees for a period longer than one year, and such guarantees may include a variety of appointments, including, but not limited to, teaching, research, and project assistantships. Satisfactory academic progress as defined by the Graduate School and the graduate program handbook is required for reappointment.\nEmployment Criteria\nDepartments or graduate programs that employ Teaching, Project or Research Assistants shall establish criteria for use in making appointments to these titles. These criteria may include but are not limited to such factors as academic record, letters of recommendation, previous relevant experience, and factors related to the academic and research missions of the department.\nCopies of established criteria will be available on request to employees. Departments and graduate programs are strongly encouraged to also make this information available on their websites. It is important to note, the employing department is not necessarily the same as the graduate program.\nLetters of Appointment\nAll newly appointed employees shall receive a letter of appointment from the employing department which specifies the supervisor, appointment title, experience classification (if any), appointment percentage, effective dates, salary or stipend level, length of probationary period (if any), hours of work or work assignment if known, and for eligible employees notification that insurance including health insurance and other benefits may be available and have deadlines for enrollment; the letter will also indicate a person or office to contact for information regarding benefits associated with the appointment. Letters of appointment shall be delivered to the employee before the start of employment.\nIn addition, reappointed employees shall receive a letter of appointment from the employing department which specifies the supervisor, appointment title, experience classification (if any), appointment percentage, effective dates, salary level, and hours of work or work assignment if known.\nProbationary Period\n\nExcept as indicated in B., a TA or PA shall serve a probationary period equivalent to one (1) academic semester in length for an academic semester length appointment or academic year appointment. Two (2) separate two (2) month summer session appointments for TAs will also satisfy the probationary period. All other PA appointments will be for a probationary period of six (6) months. A probationary period is the defined period of time during which the probationary employee may be terminated without recourse to the grievance procedure. The decision to terminate an employee’s appointment during the probationary period requires the approval of the chair/director of the department/unit (or designee). Where the employee is supervised directly by the chair/director, termination of an appointment during the probationary period requires the approval of the dean/director (or designee). An employee must be notified of termination in writing, during the probationary period, either delivered in person or electronically. No employee shall be required to serve more than one (1) probationary period in any one department.For a TA or PA who receives a subsequent appointment involving a change in title or department, the appointing department may require a permissive probationary period of the same duration as described above. The employing department shall make a determination as to whether the appointee shall serve a permissive probationary period and shall notify that employee in the letter of appointment. The employing department may waive these permissive probationary periods at any time. The employee shall be notified by the University of the determination to waive such employee’s probationary period. The University shall include consideration of the employee’s performance in their prior appointment in determining whether or not to waive the probation. This waiver is not subject to the grievance procedure.\nIf an employee’s performance is deemed unsatisfactory during their probation the supervisor and appointing department may extend the employee’s probation to no more than double the original length of the probationary period. If a probation is extended, the employee must be notified in the same manner as probationary termination.\nIn the case of an employee whose performance is deemed unsatisfactory during their probation, the supervisor and appointing department may establish a remedial program. This program may be carried out during the original or extended probationary period, or during a period of non-appointment prior to a renewed appointment. Participation in a remedial program shall not be considered part of the employee’s work duties.\nRAs do not serve probationary periods and should receive, at a minimum, annual feedback regarding their performance from their supervisor, in consultation with the employing department and graduate program. An RA should be notified in writing of where they are not making adequate progress and prepare a remedial plan to correct the deficiencies.\n\nAppointment Percentage for Project and Teaching Assistants\nDuring a semester in an academic year, employees who hold appointments as Teaching Assistants or Project Assistants shall have appointments at a level totaling at least one-third time (33%), except as provided below. Total appointments for employees may be less than one-third time with the agreement of the employee. Such appointments will require approval by the Department and Dean/Director. Employees appointed on a temporary emergency basis and all hourly pay basis Project Assistants may be appointed at a level less than one-third time.\nAppointment Percentage for Research Assistants\nDuring a semester in an academic year, employees who hold appointments as Research Assistants shall have appointments at a level totaling at least one-half time (50%)1 except as provided below. There may be extenuating reasons for RAs to be appointed less than 50%. Such appointments will require approval by the Department and Dean/Director.\nEmployment Information\nThe University will make information about openings and application procedures for Teaching Assistants or Project Assistantships available to ensure that all interested graduate students are given an opportunity to apply. Interested graduate students may follow up their interests at the department level.\nDepartments employing or anticipating the employment of Teaching Assistants or Project Assistants will maintain posted information as follows:\n\nInformation about procedures for applying for Teaching and Project Assistantships including the name or location of an office where inquiries or applications may be made.\nA listing of courses that typically have Teaching Assistants assigned or are expected to have Teaching Assistants assigned. This list will be updated to include special course opportunities that may become available. A separate list of summer sessions course possibilities will be posted if applicable.\nInformation about other Teaching or Project Assistantships that may become available.\n\nEmployment information will be posted electronically in a location designated by the department and easily accessible to graduate students. The University will maintain a web site on which open positions shall be posted. Open positions do not include: positions reserved for guarantees of support and/or recruiting offers; reappointments (continuing positions); and positions that must be filled within seven (7) days for emergency purposes.\nTeaching Assistant Course Assignments\nTeaching Assistants may request assignment to particular courses, and when in the department’s judgment the Teaching Assistant is qualified to teach the course, the course supervisor is agreeable to the assignment, and the department can staff its courses in a manner which it deems satisfactory, the Teaching Assistant’s request shall be granted.\nDepartments shall notify appointed Teaching Assistants of their tentative course assignments, if known, no later than August 1 for fall semester courses and December 1 for spring semester courses. Such notification does not guarantee the assignment.\nTeaching Assistant and Project Assistant Duties\nIn assigning duties to Teaching Assistants or Project Assistants:\nThe department and supervising staff member shall establish the required duties of the employee and the supervising staff member shall discuss these duties with the employee at the beginning of the appointment period.\nIt is understood that Teaching Assistants and Project Assistants are engaged in professional activities of such a nature that the output produced or the result accomplished cannot be precisely measured in relation to a given period of time. In determining the amount of time expected for an employee assignment, consideration shall be given to such factors as type of instruction, number of students instructed, and all other factors, including those specific to the course or group of courses to which instructional duty expectations apply. Fluctuations above and below the hours reflected in the appointment level are expected, corresponding to individual distinctions such as experience. Recognizing that Teaching and Project Assistants are embarked on a program of career and professional development, employees are encouraged to discuss duties with the supervising staff member, at the outset of the appointment and as questions may arise during the appointment.\nIn the case of Teaching Assistants, each department shall provide the employee and their supervisor with an appointment worksheet with the appointment letter at least three (3) days before signed workload sheets are to be returned by the employee, prior to each term of appointment (Fall, Spring and Summer). Copies of these estimates shall be provided to course supervisors.\nIn addition, the employee and their supervisor will have an opportunity to review that worksheet at the commencement of the Teaching Assistant’s employment and throughout the semester. The worksheet shall indicate the approximate distribution of hours to be spent on the various duties required by the appointment and shall include hours for -mandated training time and for any training required by the University and deemed necessary for the performance of the employee’s duties.\nThe function of the aforementioned worksheet is advisory. Neither the specific distribution of hours among tasks on this worksheet, nor deviation from the apportionment of hours shall be construed as binding or grievable.\nDepartments are encouraged to establish workload committees consisting of faculty, staff and graduate students who are current or former Teaching Assistants or Project Assistants to review new and existing workloads for Teaching and Project Assistants annually, identify persistent workload problems and recommend remedies to the department. If a workload committee does not exist, one may be established at the request of a majority of the Departmental Teaching and Project Assistants.\nThe appointment level for Teaching Assistants or Project Assistants shall be based on the department’s determination of the amount of time it should normally take to perform the assigned duties including orientation and training. Satisfactory performance of these duties shall not require an effort exceeding three hundred and sixty (360) hours per semester for a halftime (50%) academic year pay basis appointment; one thousand and forty (1040) hours per year for a halftime (50%) annual pay basis appointment; eight hundred and sixty-seven (867) hours per ten-month period for a halftime (50%) ten-month pay basis appointment; or a proportional number of hours for other durations or percentages of appointment.\nAll Teaching Assistant or Project Assistant duties required by the supervising staff member or the department shall be fairly within the scope of employment and shall be included in the calculation of required hours.\nThe number of hours are stated for the full appointment period, but hours needed to carry out required duties may fluctuate over portions of the appointment period. As soon as the University becomes aware of substantial fluctuations which will occur the employee will be so notified. Except for full time (100%) appointments, if the University knew or should with the exercise of reasonable diligence have known of a substantial increase in the number of hours needed to carry out required duties during a particular period and did not so notify the employee, the employee shall not be required to work more than forty (40) hours in any one week.\nInformal discussion between a supervisor and an employee is likely to be the most effective way to resolve problems in assignment of duties. An employee who finds that the assigned duties appear to require more time than is allocated should immediately notify, and consult with, the supervisor or Department Chair (or designee), who shall reconsider the factors used to determine the amount of time expected. The supervisor and the department may direct either an adjustment in the duties or, pending approval of funding, an adjustment in the appointment level.\nAn employee may submit to the supervisor or Department Chair (or designee) a written request that the duties required be revised. A response shall be made within one (1) week of the written request unless the employee and the department mutually agree to a longer period. If the employee is dissatisfied with the response or no response is forthcoming, the employee may file a grievance. No such grievance will be considered unless there has been a prior written request to make an adjustment.\nA department or supervisor may establish reasonable prerequisites which a Teaching Assistant or Project Assistant must meet in order to hold a particular position and determine whether those prerequisites have been met before the Teaching or Project Assistant becomes eligible to perform those duties. Any prerequisites shall be posted along with the job opening. If a Teaching or Project Assistant requests to hold a position and has not met the prerequisites, the employee shall not be paid for time involved in meeting the prerequisites if the request is granted. If a Teaching or Project Assistant is assigned to a course which the employee has not requested and for which she or he does not meet the prerequisites, the employee shall be paid for the time which is necessary to satisfactorily meet those prerequisites.\nResearch Assistant Activities\nIn assigning activities to RAs, the nature of the work is different than TAs and PAs. RAs are typically not assigned specific duties2. RAs are working toward developing skills in their specific field, and therefore the nature of skills and rate of acquisition of these skills may vary greatly across disciplines and individuals. It is therefore not possible to establish blanket descriptions of duties for RAs that uniformly apply to all in the title.\nThe research assistant and supervising faculty/staff member shall collaboratively develop a research program plan. These research program plans are encouraged to be reviewed by the department chair, program chair, and/or thesis committee.\nIt is understood that RAs are engaged in professional activities of such a nature that the output produced or the result accomplished cannot be precisely measured in relation to a given period of time. Fluctuations above and below the hours reflected in the appointment level are expected. Recognizing that RAs are embarked on a program of educational, career and professional development, employees are encouraged to discuss both a plan of academic study as well as the research program plan with the supervising faculty/staff member, at the outset of the appointment and as questions arise during the appointment3.\nThe employee and their supervisor will have an opportunity to review expectations at the commencement of the RAs employment. The employee and their supervisor shall have periodic meetings to discuss research progress.\nThe function of the aforementioned expectation review is advisory. Neither the specific distribution of hours among tasks, nor deviation from the apportionment of effort shall be construed as binding or grievable.\nInformal discussion between a supervisor and an employee is likely to be the most effective way to resolve problems. Employees are also encouraged to consult their academic program director, handbook and/or thesis committee for additional guidance. An employee who finds that the research plan appears to require more time, involves inappropriate work duties or duties incommensurate with the activities, should consult with the supervisor, who shall reconsider the factors used to determine the expectations. The supervisor and/or the department/unit may adjust the activities.\nFor RA appointments the grievance/appeal procedure regarding the assigned activities is documented by the admitting program’s graduate program handbook. Additional resources may be available based on your employing unit or college. In the event a satisfactory resolution is not achieved, the RA can utilize the Graduate School appeal process.\nWork Surroundings\nThe Department will provide appropriate resources and an adequate and safe work environment necessary for the performance of job responsibilities including access to an office or shared workspace in which to conduct their work. Examples include but are not limited to: access to a printer and copier, access to a computer or laptop, office/instructional supplies, software necessary for instructional tasks / job duties, a departmental mailbox, personal protective equipment, and access to equipment operation manuals, records of equipment safety inspection reports, appropriate lockout/tag out procedures, and hazardous chemical Safety Data Sheets (SDSs). If an employee believes that additional resources or facilities are needed to perform such duties, then they are encouraged to contact their immediate supervisor for the purpose of discussing such needs.\nDepartments are encouraged to consult with a representative group of Teaching or Project Assistants to determine what resources may be necessary for the performance of TA/PA job responsibilities. If the matter is not resolved to the satisfaction of the employee in a reasonable amount of time, then they may bring their concerns directly to the department chair/director.\nThe University will make a good faith effort to provide resources and facilities commensurate with job expectations. Departments will not require employees to pay for resources that the Department has determined are essential for instruction, research or other assigned work.\nThe University of Wisconsin–Madison is committed to creating an accessible and inclusive campus experience for all members of the campus community.\nEmployees seeking information regarding accommodations in their workplace should contact the Campus Disability Coordinator:\n ADA Resources\nCampus Disability Coordinator\nEmployees seeking information regarding accommodations in their studies should contact McBurney Disability Resources Center.\nOrientation and Training\nThe University is responsible for orientation, training, and evaluation of employees. The University recognizes that the professional nature of Teaching, Project and Research Assistants means that these employees have effective contributions to make to their own working performance and environment and that of their colleagues. The parties encourage all schools and colleges, and/or programs, to hold training sessions.\nThe University orients and trains employees regarding appropriate safety and security precautions in a timely manner.\nDepartments and other appointing units are encouraged to review the training and orientation programs available to their Teaching, Project and Research Assistants, and to consult with employees in these groups about ways in which the effectiveness of these programs can be enhanced.\nTeaching and Project Assistant Orientation and Training\nColleges, Schools and Divisions that employ Teaching Assistants or Project Assistants are encouraged to hold training sessions before the fall semester.\nEach department that employs new Teaching Assistants in the fall and spring semesters shall provide training for them, either alone or in combination with other departments. The training shall consist of a minimum of eight (8) required hours designed to aid them in their teaching duties. At least two (2) of these hours of training must come during the semester. The content, design and emphasis of the training shall be determined by the department chair or designee(s). For the fall semester training, a written description of the program shall be available upon request. A Teaching Assistant may be exempted from attending these sessions by the decision of the department chair or designee(s), provided that the Teaching Assistant has previous post-secondary teaching experience. Departments may have more extensive training programs available for certain groups of Teaching Assistants.\nThe University conducts training workshops for Teaching and Project Assistants that will address diversity issues deemed by the University to be relevant to the activities of these employees within their employment with the University. These workshops will be developed in consultation with the campus Office of Equity and Diversity, Teaching Assistants and Project Assistants, and other appropriate offices. These workshops shall not count toward the eight (8) hours of training described above.\nPerformance Evaluation\nTEACHING AND PROJECT ASSISTANT EVALUATIONS\nEach employing unit shall establish an evaluation process to review performance of duties and ability. Employees shall be informed of the evaluation process and criteria for evaluation at the start of the period for which they are being evaluated.\nTeaching Assistant evaluations may include input from the following sources, but should not consist solely of student evaluations:\n\nIndividual student evaluation of the teaching performance of a Teaching Assistant in a course in which the student is enrolled.\nFaculty and staff review of employee performance. If such a review includes an assessment of a Teaching Assistant’s laboratory or classroom performance, the assessment shall include at least one (1) visit by a faculty or staff member. A Teaching Assistant will be given at least twenty-four (24) hours’ notice prior to the initial visit in a semester for this purpose. Prior notice is not required for faculty and/or staff visits for any other purpose, including subsequent visits for evaluation purposes.\nSelf review.\nPeer Review.\n\nPerformance will be reviewed at least once during the term of the appointment. Copies of written performance evaluation reports will be provided to employees. A copy of this report and any written evaluations will be given to the employee who will have the right to make a written response to be placed in their personnel file. Departments are encouraged to provide supervision and evaluation throughout the appointment period.\nIn the event review of Teaching Assistant or Project Assistant teaching performance includes a committee, the committee shall have a faculty majority; its membership may include employee representatives chosen by employees and may include other staff and students.\nIf student evaluations are part of the Teaching or Project Assistant evaluation process, employees will be notified at least forty-eight hours prior to distribution of student evaluation forms. Student evaluations may be part of the Teaching or Project Assistant evaluation process, but shall not be the sole method for evaluating Teaching Assistants.\nRESEARCH ASSISTANT EVALUATIONS\nResearch Assistant performance should be evaluated at least annually. These evaluations should include input from 1 and 2, and may also include, but may not be based solely upon, input from 3,\n\nFaculty/staff supervisor review of employee performance. If such a review includes an assessment of a RAs laboratory performance, the assessment shall include at least one (1) visit by a faculty/staff member.\nThesis Committee Review.\nSelf review and/or Individual Development Plan (IDP) Process.\n\nIf the evaluation process is implemented by a thesis committee, the composition of such committee shall be in accordance with established graduate program and Graduate School procedures.\nComments and data that evidence illegal discrimination shall be excluded from consideration, and the presence of such comments shall be considered in weighing the evaluation as a whole.\nSince RA appointments involve a combined academic and employment experience, there may be a separate academic evaluation made by the supervisor and/or enrolling graduate program. The research assistant and their supervisor should have periodic and ongoing conversations to discuss research progress.\nDiscrimination, Discriminatory Harassment and Retaliation\nThe University of Wisconsin–Madison is committed to providing equal opportunity and equal access and to complying with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations and University of Wisconsin System and university non-discrimination policies and procedures, including Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, which prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability, and the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of age.\nThe University strives to provide a workplace and educational environment free from harassment. Towards that goal, departments shall take affirmative steps to create and maintain workplaces free from harassment.

Grievances may be filed by a Teaching, Project or Research Assistant. Academic-related grievances are pursued through processes described in graduate program handbooks with subsequent appeals following Graduate School policy. An employee who files a grievance is referred to as the grievant. A grievant is encouraged to discuss the complaint with their immediate supervisor as well as other campus resources (e.g. department chair, dean/director, human resources representative, etc.) prior to filing a grievance. The primary purpose of this procedure is to secure equitable solutions to the grievance(s) at the most immediate level possible.\nThe word “days” for the purpose of this article shall be working days and shall not include weekends, university holidays, spring recess or the period from the last day of exams of the fall semester to the first day of the next instructional period, or days in which the grievant is required to leave Madison for extended work-related purposes (e.g. field work or conferences). All time limits may be modified by mutual consent.\nTo the fullest extent possible, a grievance shall contain a clear and concise statement of the grievance and indicate the issue(s) involved, the relief sought, the date(s) the incident or violation took place and the specific policy section or sections involved. The grievance shall be signed and dated by the grievant(s) and representative (if any).\nA grievant shall be notified of the ability to have the assistance of a personal representative. A grievant has the right to find representation of their choosing during the grievance process. The designated representative may change at any time during the process. If representation is chosen and the representative is an attorney, the grievant must alert the University. The grievant cannot be compelled to meet without their representative, however it is the grievant’s responsibility to find representation that can meet within the allotted time frame.\nMeeting with Grievance Representatives.\nA grievant may consult with their representative regarding a grievance, or process a grievance, during working hours for a reasonable period of time, provided that this meeting does not interfere with scheduled work activities.\nGrievances should be presented as soon as reasonably possible, typically no later than sixty (60) days from the date the grievant first became aware of, or should have become aware of with the exercise of reasonable diligence, the cause of such grievance.\nSteps One and Two of the grievance procedure may be waived by mutual agreement.\nThe Grievant and representative (if chosen) shall have the right to file a grievance when any provision of these procedures are alleged to have been violated. Possible relief may include extending the grievance timeframe to ensure that these procedures are followed.\nGrievances may continue after graduation or voluntary separation. In cases of involuntary termination, grievances may be filed by former employees, but must adhere to the relevant timeline(s).\nReceipt of a grievance for purposes of meeting timeline requirements at each step is determined by the date stamp on the grievance form (if hand delivered), digital timestamp (if filed electronically), or envelope postmark (if delivered by U.S. Mail).\nGrievances not answered by the employer within the designated time limits in any step of the grievance procedure may be appealed to the next step within ten (10) days of the expiration of the designated time limits.\nGrievance Steps\nStep One:\nThe grievant must file a written statement with the appointing department/unit chair/director or their designee specifying the grievant’s name, a clear and concise statement of the grievance and the issue(s) involved, the date(s) the incident or violation took place and the specific policy section or sections involved, and the relief sought, The grievance shall be signed and dated by the grievant(s) and representative (if any).\nWithin twenty (20) days of receipt of the written grievance, the department chair/director or designee will meet with the grievant and their representative (if chosen) to hear the grievance and will return a written answer to the grievant and their representative (if chosen) no later than ten (10) days after this meeting. This answer will include a copy of the grievance procedure appeal process timeline, a list of resources and relevant contact information of personnel hearing future steps.\nStep Two:\nIf the decision in Step One is not accepted by the grievant, the grievant shall have 10 days from receipt of the answer in Step One to file an appeal with the appropriate appointing department/unit Dean/Director or designee. The Dean/Director or designee will meet with the grievant and their representative (if chosen) within twenty (20) days from receipt of the appeal of Step One and attempt to resolve the grievance. The Dean/Director or designee will provide the grievant and their representative (if chosen) with a written response to the grievance no later than ten (10) days after this meeting.\nStep Three:\nIf the decision in Step Two is not accepted by the grievant, the grievant shall have 10 days from the receipt of the answer in Step Two to file an appeal with the Office of Human Resources (OHR), specifically the Office of Workforce Relations (OWR). The OHR-OWR office will meet with the grievant and their representative (if chosen) within twenty (20) days from receipt of the appeal of Step Two.\nThe OHR-OWR will provide a written decision to the grievant and their representative (if chosen), no later than ten (10) days after this meeting.\nStep Four:\nGrievances that are not resolved under the foregoing procedure may be appealed to the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission (WERC) by the grievant within twenty (20) days from the date of the answer in Step Three. If an unresolved grievance is not appealed to the WERC within twenty (20) days of the final resolution of Step Three, it shall be considered terminated on the basis of the Third Step answer of the responding party without prejudice or precedent in the resolution of future grievances. The issue as stated on the Third Step grievance and any amendments made thereon, in writing, at the Third Step grievance meeting shall constitute the sole and entire subject matter to be heard by the WERC hearing examiner, unless the parties agree to modify the scope of the hearing. The WERC hearing examiner will be selected by mutual consent of both parties. If the parties have utilized mediation, no reference to mediation shall be admitted as evidence in the hearing.\nWhere two (2) or more grievances are appealed to the WERC by the same individual or regarding a substantially similar matter, an effort will be made by the parties to have the grievances heard by the same hearing examiner.\nThe University will bear the cost of the WERC hearing fees.\nThe hearing examiner shall not have jurisdiction or authority to add to, amend, modify, nullify, or ignore in any way the provisions of University Policy.\nThe decision of the hearing examiner will be forwarded to the Chancellor or Chancellor’s designee for review. The Chancellor or Chancellor’s designee shall release a decision either accepting, rejecting, or modifying the hearing examiner’s decision. The Chancellor’s decision will be final and binding on both parties.\nThe decision of the Chancellor or Chancellor’s designee will be rendered within thirty (30) days from receipt of the WERC’s decision. If no decision is made by the Chancellor or Chancellor’s designee within thirty (30) days, then the decision of the WERC becomes final.\nRetroactivity.\nSettlement of grievances may or may not be retroactive as the equities of particular cases may demand. In any case, the maximum period of retroactivity allowed shall be a date not earlier than sixty (60) days prior to the date of initiation of the written grievance in Step One unless the circumstances of the case made it impossible for the employee to know they had grounds for such claim prior to that date, in which case the retroactivity shall be limited to a period of ninety (90) days prior to the date the grievance was initiated in writing. Employees who voluntarily terminate their employment will have their grievances immediately withdrawn and will not benefit by any later settlement of a group grievance. Graduation shall not be considered voluntary termination for purposes of retroactivity.\nExclusive Procedure.\nThe grievance procedure set out above shall be exclusive and shall replace any other grievance procedure for adjustment of any disputes arising from the application and interpretation of these policies and procedures.\nFurther, in a group grievance, only one (1) grievant shall be the spokesperson for the group. Group grievances must be so designated at each step of the grievance procedure and set forth a list of all employees covered by the grievance. No employees may be added to the list of group grievants after the second step hearing. Relief is restricted to those employees identified by name in the group grievance. Individual grievances which meet the definition of group grievances as contained herein shall be consolidated at each step of the grievance procedure whenever possible. Individual grievances which do not specifically meet the definition of group grievance, contained herein, may be consolidated by mutual agreement.\nDiscipline.\nThe University has the ability to suspend, discharge or take other appropriate disciplinary action against employees for just cause (defined below). If any discipline is taken against an employee, the employee will receive a copy of this disciplinary action. An employee who alleges that such action was without just cause may appeal a suspension or discharge beginning with the second step of the grievance procedure. An employee shall be entitled to the presence of a grievance representative at an investigatory interview if he/she requests one and if the employee has reasonable grounds to believe that the interview may be used to support disciplinary action against him/her. Whenever it is appropriate, the Employer shall give the employee and the grievance representative advance notice of the Employer’s intent to hold an investigatory interview.\nJust Cause\nThe basic elements of just cause have been reduced by arbitrator Carroll R. Daugherty to seven tests outlined below:\n\nNOTICE: Did the Employer give to the employee forewarning or foreknowledge of the possible or probable consequences of the employee’s disciplinary conduct?\nREASONABLE RULE OR ORDER: Was the Employer’s rules or managerial order reasonably related to (a) the orderly, efficient, and safe operation of the Employer’s business, and (b) the performance that the Employer might properly expect of the employee?\nINVESTIGATION: Did the Employer, before administering the discipline to an employee, make an effort to discover whether the employee did in fact violate or disobey a rule or order of management?\nFAIR INVESTIGATION: Was the Employer’s investigation conducted fairly and objectively?\nPROOF: At the investigation, did the “judge” obtain substantial evidence or proof that the employee was guilty as charged?\nEQUAL TREATMENT: Has the Employer applied its rules, orders and penalties evenhandedly and without discrimination to all employees?\nPENALTY: Was the degree of discipline administered by the Employer in a particular case reasonably related to (a) the seriousness of the employee’s proven offense, and (b) the record of the employee in his service of the Employer?\n\nExclusion of Probationary Employees.\nThe release of probationary employees shall not be subject to the grievance procedure.\nRelated UW-Madison Policies:\n\nUW-5050 Personal and Legal Holidays\nUW-5054 Paid Parental Leave\nUW-1238 Graduate Assistantships\n\nRelated UW–Madison Documents, Web Pages, or Other Resources:\n\nGraduate Assistant Payment of Segregated Fees Policy\nLactation Rooms – Office of Child Care and Family Resources\n\nExternal References:\n\nTuition Remission\nHealth insurance rates and information are found: hr.wisc.edu/benefits\nTravel and Reimbursement – Division of Business Services\nSection 7(r) of the Fair Labor Standards Act – Break Time for Nursing Mothers Provision\nOffice of Environment, Health, and Safety.\nOffice of Environmental and Occupational Health\nEqual Opportunity Complaint Investigation\nADA Resources\nCampus Disability Coordinator\nMcBurney Disability Resources Center\nGraduate School appeal process\nPublic Records Law (Wisconsin state statute 19.31-39)\nTo make a Public Records Request send an email through the UW–Madison Public Records service mailbox: public_records@wisc.edu\nTo view additional information about the Public Records Law, go to compliance.wisc.edu and click on the Public Records link\n\n\nPolicy Administration\n\nApproval Authority:\nVice Chancellor for Finance and Administration\nPolicy Manager:\nAssociate Vice Chancellor/Chief Human Resources Officer\nContact:\nEmployment Relations Director -- Megan Dzyuba, wr@ohr.wisc.edu, (608) 890-3663\nRevised Dates:\n01-28-2020, 02-09-2024, 02-14-2025\nRetrieved:\n08-05-2025 11:11:25\nLayout for printing\nPolicy Number:\nUW-5082\nResponsible Office:\nOffice of Human Resources\nLayout for printing\nPolicy Number:\nUW-5082\nResponsible Office:\nOffice of Human Resources\nDefinitions:\nDay\nA calendar day, unless otherwise specifically stated.\nYear\nFiscal year (from July 1 through June 30), unless otherwise indicated.\nEmployee\nA graduate student registered at the University, who is currently appointed as a teaching assistant, research assistant or project assistant (including reader/grader).\nUniversity\nThe University of Wisconsin–Madison and University of Wisconsin-Extension.\nDepartment\nAny administrative unit, center or institute which directly employs teaching, project assistants and/or research assistants.\nGraduate Program\nAn academic program which has admitted the student to matriculated graduate study at UW–Madison.\nWork time\nScheduled and Unscheduled work time.\nScheduled work time\nThat portion of work time which is normally scheduled by or at the direction of the University.\nUnscheduled work time\nThat portion of work time which is flexible and normally self-scheduled by the employee.\nProject Assistant (PA)\nThis title designates graduate students enrolled in UW–Madison who are employed to assist with research, training, administrative responsibilities or other academic programs or projects under the supervision of a member or members of the faculty or academic staff, as defined in s. 36.05(1) or (8), Wis.

It is important to note, the employing department is not necessarily the same as the graduate program.\nLetters of Appointment\nAll newly appointed employees shall receive a letter of appointment from the employing department which specifies the supervisor, appointment title, experience classification (if any), appointment percentage, effective dates, salary or stipend level, length of probationary period (if any), hours of work or work assignment if known, and for eligible employees notification that insurance including health insurance and other benefits may be available and have deadlines for enrollment; the letter will also indicate a person or office to contact for information regarding benefits associated with the appointment. Letters of appointment shall be delivered to the employee before the start of employment.\nIn addition, reappointed employees shall receive a letter of appointment from the employing department which specifies the supervisor, appointment title, experience classification (if any), appointment percentage, effective dates, salary level, and hours of work or work assignment if known.\nProbationary Period\n\nExcept as indicated in B., a TA or PA shall serve a probationary period equivalent to one (1) academic semester in length for an academic semester length appointment or academic year appointment. Two (2) separate two (2) month summer session appointments for TAs will also satisfy the probationary period. All other PA appointments will be for a probationary period of six (6) months. A probationary period is the defined period of time during which the probationary employee may be terminated without recourse to the grievance procedure. The decision to terminate an employee’s appointment during the probationary period requires the approval of the chair/director of the department/unit (or designee). Where the employee is supervised directly by the chair/director, termination of an appointment during the probationary period requires the approval of the dean/director (or designee). An employee must be notified of termination in writing, during the probationary period, either delivered in person or electronically. No employee shall be required to serve more than one (1) probationary period in any one department.For a TA or PA who receives a subsequent appointment involving a change in title or department, the appointing department may require a permissive probationary period of the same duration as described above. The employing department shall make a determination as to whether the appointee shall serve a permissive probationary period and shall notify that employee in the letter of appointment. The employing department may waive these permissive probationary periods at any time. The employee shall be notified by the University of the determination to waive such employee’s probationary period. The University shall include consideration of the employee’s performance in their prior appointment in determining whether or not to waive the probation. This waiver is not subject to the grievance procedure.\nIf an employee’s performance is deemed unsatisfactory during their probation the supervisor and appointing department may extend the employee’s probation to no more than double the original length of the probationary period. If a probation is extended, the employee must be notified in the same manner as probationary termination.\nIn the case of an employee whose performance is deemed unsatisfactory during their probation, the supervisor and appointing department may establish a remedial program. This program may be carried out during the original or extended probationary period, or during a period of non-appointment prior to a renewed appointment. Participation in a remedial program shall not be considered part of the employee’s work duties.\nRAs do not serve probationary periods and should receive, at a minimum, annual feedback regarding their performance from their supervisor, in consultation with the employing department and graduate program. An RA should be notified in writing of where they are not making adequate progress and prepare a remedial plan to correct the deficiencies.\n\nAppointment Percentage for Project and Teaching Assistants\nDuring a semester in an academic year, employees who hold appointments as Teaching Assistants or Project Assistants shall have appointments at a level totaling at least one-third time (33%), except as provided below. Total appointments for employees may be less than one-third time with the agreement of the employee. Such appointments will require approval by the Department and Dean/Director. Employees appointed on a temporary emergency basis and all hourly pay basis Project Assistants may be appointed at a level less than one-third time.\nAppointment Percentage for Research Assistants\nDuring a semester in an academic year, employees who hold appointments as Research Assistants shall have appointments at a level totaling at least one-half time (50%)1 except as provided below. There may be extenuating reasons for RAs to be appointed less than 50%. Such appointments will require approval by the Department and Dean/Director.\nEmployment Information\nThe University will make information about openings and application procedures for Teaching Assistants or Project Assistantships available to ensure that all interested graduate students are given an opportunity to apply. Interested graduate students may follow up their interests at the department level.\nDepartments employing or anticipating the employment of Teaching Assistants or Project Assistants will maintain posted information as follows:\n\nInformation about procedures for applying for Teaching and Project Assistantships including the name or location of an office where inquiries or applications may be made.\nA listing of courses that typically have Teaching Assistants assigned or are expected to have Teaching Assistants assigned. This list will be updated to include special course opportunities that may become available. A separate list of summer sessions course possibilities will be posted if applicable.\nInformation about other Teaching or Project Assistantships that may become available.\n\nEmployment information will be posted electronically in a location designated by the department and easily accessible to graduate students. The University will maintain a web site on which open positions shall be posted. Open positions do not include: positions reserved for guarantees of support and/or recruiting offers; reappointments (continuing positions); and positions that must be filled within seven (7) days for emergency purposes.\nTeaching Assistant Course Assignments\nTeaching Assistants may request assignment to particular courses, and when in the department’s judgment the Teaching Assistant is qualified to teach the course, the course supervisor is agreeable to the assignment, and the department can staff its courses in a manner which it deems satisfactory, the Teaching Assistant’s request shall be granted.\nDepartments shall notify appointed Teaching Assistants of their tentative course assignments, if known, no later than August 1 for fall semester courses and December 1 for spring semester courses. Such notification does not guarantee the assignment.\nTeaching Assistant and Project Assistant Duties\nIn assigning duties to Teaching Assistants or Project Assistants:\nThe department and supervising staff member shall establish the required duties of the employee and the supervising staff member shall discuss these duties with the employee at the beginning of the appointment period.\nIt is understood that Teaching Assistants and Project Assistants are engaged in professional activities of such a nature that the output produced or the result accomplished cannot be precisely measured in relation to a given period of time. In determining the amount of time expected for an employee assignment, consideration shall be given to such factors as type of instruction, number of students instructed, and all other factors, including those specific to the course or group of courses to which instructional duty expectations apply. Fluctuations above and below the hours reflected in the appointment level are expected, corresponding to individual distinctions such as experience. Recognizing that Teaching and Project Assistants are embarked on a program of career and professional development, employees are encouraged to discuss duties with the supervising staff member, at the outset of the appointment and as questions may arise during the appointment.\nIn the case of Teaching Assistants, each department shall provide the employee and their supervisor with an appointment worksheet with the appointment letter at least three (3) days before signed workload sheets are to be returned by the employee, prior to each term of appointment (Fall, Spring and Summer). Copies of these estimates shall be provided to course supervisors.\nIn addition, the employee and their supervisor will have an opportunity to review that worksheet at the commencement of the Teaching Assistant’s employment and throughout the semester. The worksheet shall indicate the approximate distribution of hours to be spent on the various duties required by the appointment and shall include hours for -mandated training time and for any training required by the University and deemed necessary for the performance of the employee’s duties.\nThe function of the aforementioned worksheet is advisory. Neither the specific distribution of hours among tasks on this worksheet, nor deviation from the apportionment of hours shall be construed as binding or grievable.\nDepartments are encouraged to establish workload committees consisting of faculty, staff and graduate students who are current or former Teaching Assistants or Project Assistants to review new and existing workloads for Teaching and Project Assistants annually, identify persistent workload problems and recommend remedies to the department. If a workload committee does not exist, one may be established at the request of a majority of the Departmental Teaching and Project Assistants.\nThe appointment level for Teaching Assistants or Project Assistants shall be based on the department’s determination of the amount of time it should normally take to perform the assigned duties including orientation and training. Satisfactory performance of these duties shall not require an effort exceeding three hundred and sixty (360) hours per semester for a halftime (50%) academic year pay basis appointment; one thousand and forty (1040) hours per year for a halftime (50%) annual pay basis appointment; eight hundred and sixty-seven (867) hours per ten-month period for a halftime (50%) ten-month pay basis appointment; or a proportional number of hours for other durations or percentages of appointment.\nAll Teaching Assistant or Project Assistant duties required by the supervising staff member or the department shall be fairly within the scope of employment and shall be included in the calculation of required hours.\nThe number of hours are stated for the full appointment period, but hours needed to carry out required duties may fluctuate over portions of the appointment period. As soon as the University becomes aware of substantial fluctuations which will occur the employee will be so notified. Except for full time (100%) appointments, if the University knew or should with the exercise of reasonable diligence have known of a substantial increase in the number of hours needed to carry out required duties during a particular period and did not so notify the employee, the employee shall not be required to work more than forty (40) hours in any one week.\nInformal discussion between a supervisor and an employee is likely to be the most effective way to resolve problems in assignment of duties. An employee who finds that the assigned duties appear to require more time than is allocated should immediately notify, and consult with, the supervisor or Department Chair (or designee), who shall reconsider the factors used to determine the amount of time expected. The supervisor and the department may direct either an adjustment in the duties or, pending approval of funding, an adjustment in the appointment level.\nAn employee may submit to the supervisor or Department Chair (or designee) a written request that the duties required be revised. A response shall be made within one (1) week of the written request unless the employee and the department mutually agree to a longer period. If the employee is dissatisfied with the response or no response is forthcoming, the employee may file a grievance. No such grievance will be considered unless there has been a prior written request to make an adjustment.\nA department or supervisor may establish reasonable prerequisites which a Teaching Assistant or Project Assistant must meet in order to hold a particular position and determine whether those prerequisites have been met before the Teaching or Project Assistant becomes eligible to perform those duties. Any prerequisites shall be posted along with the job opening. If a Teaching or Project Assistant requests to hold a position and has not met the prerequisites, the employee shall not be paid for time involved in meeting the prerequisites if the request is granted. If a Teaching or Project Assistant is assigned to a course which the employee has not requested and for which she or he does not meet the prerequisites, the employee shall be paid for the time which is necessary to satisfactorily meet those prerequisites.\nResearch Assistant Activities\nIn assigning activities to RAs, the nature of the work is different than TAs and PAs. RAs are typically not assigned specific duties2. RAs are working toward developing skills in their specific field, and therefore the nature of skills and rate of acquisition of these skills may vary greatly across disciplines and individuals. It is therefore not possible to establish blanket descriptions of duties for RAs that uniformly apply to all in the title.\nThe research assistant and supervising faculty/staff member shall collaboratively develop a research program plan. These research program plans are encouraged to be reviewed by the department chair, program chair, and/or thesis committee.\nIt is understood that RAs are engaged in professional activities of such a nature that the output produced or the result accomplished cannot be precisely measured in relation to a given period of time. Fluctuations above and below the hours reflected in the appointment level are expected. Recognizing that RAs are embarked on a program of educational, career and professional development, employees are encouraged to discuss both a plan of academic study as well as the research program plan with the supervising faculty/staff member, at the outset of the appointment and as questions arise during the appointment3.\nThe employee and their supervisor will have an opportunity to review expectations at the commencement of the RAs employment. The employee and their supervisor shall have periodic meetings to discuss research progress.\nThe function of the aforementioned expectation review is advisory. Neither the specific distribution of hours among tasks, nor deviation from the apportionment of effort shall be construed as binding or grievable.\nInformal discussion between a supervisor and an employee is likely to be the most effective way to resolve problems. Employees are also encouraged to consult their academic program director, handbook and/or thesis committee for additional guidance. An employee who finds that the research plan appears to require more time, involves inappropriate work duties or duties incommensurate with the activities, should consult with the supervisor, who shall reconsider the factors used to determine the expectations. The supervisor and/or the department/unit may adjust the activities.\nFor RA appointments the grievance/appeal procedure regarding the assigned activities is documented by the admitting program’s graduate program handbook. Additional resources may be available based on your employing unit or college. In the event a satisfactory resolution is not achieved, the RA can utilize the Graduate School appeal process.\nWork Surroundings\nThe Department will provide appropriate resources and an adequate and safe work environment necessary for the performance of job responsibilities including access to an office or shared workspace in which to conduct their work. Examples include but are not limited to: access to a printer and copier, access to a computer or laptop, office/instructional supplies, software necessary for instructional tasks / job duties, a departmental mailbox, personal protective equipment, and access to equipment operation manuals, records of equipment safety inspection reports, appropriate lockout/tag out procedures, and hazardous chemical Safety Data Sheets (SDSs). If an employee believes that additional resources or facilities are needed to perform such duties, then they are encouraged to contact their immediate supervisor for the purpose of discussing such needs.\nDepartments are encouraged to consult with a representative group of Teaching or Project Assistants to determine what resources may be necessary for the performance of TA/PA job responsibilities. If the matter is not resolved to the satisfaction of the employee in a reasonable amount of time, then they may bring their concerns directly to the department chair/director.\nThe University will make a good faith effort to provide resources and facilities commensurate with job expectations. Departments will not require employees to pay for resources that the Department has determined are essential for instruction, research or other assigned work.\nThe University of Wisconsin–Madison is committed to creating an accessible and inclusive campus experience for all members of the campus community.\nEmployees seeking information regarding accommodations in their workplace should contact the Campus Disability Coordinator:\n ADA Resources\nCampus Disability Coordinator\nEmployees seeking information regarding accommodations in their studies should contact McBurney Disability Resources Center.\nOrientation and Training\nThe University is responsible for orientation, training, and evaluation of employees. The University recognizes that the professional nature of Teaching, Project and Research Assistants means that these employees have effective contributions to make to their own working performance and environment and that of their colleagues. The parties encourage all schools and colleges, and/or programs, to hold training sessions.\nThe University orients and trains employees regarding appropriate safety and security precautions in a timely manner.\nDepartments and other appointing units are encouraged to review the training and orientation programs available to their Teaching, Project and Research Assistants, and to consult with employees in these groups about ways in which the effectiveness of these programs can be enhanced.\nTeaching and Project Assistant Orientation and Training\nColleges, Schools and Divisions that employ Teaching Assistants or Project Assistants are encouraged to hold training sessions before the fall semester.\nEach department that employs new Teaching Assistants in the fall and spring semesters shall provide training for them, either alone or in combination with other departments. The training shall consist of a minimum of eight (8) required hours designed to aid them in their teaching duties. At least two (2) of these hours of training must come during the semester. The content, design and emphasis of the training shall be determined by the department chair or designee(s). For the fall semester training, a written description of the program shall be available upon request. A Teaching Assistant may be exempted from attending these sessions by the decision of the department chair or designee(s), provided that the Teaching Assistant has previous post-secondary teaching experience. Departments may have more extensive training programs available for certain groups of Teaching Assistants.\nThe University conducts training workshops for Teaching and Project Assistants that will address diversity issues deemed by the University to be relevant to the activities of these employees within their employment with the University. These workshops will be developed in consultation with the campus Office of Equity and Diversity, Teaching Assistants and Project Assistants, and other appropriate offices. These workshops shall not count toward the eight (8) hours of training described above.\nPerformance Evaluation\nTEACHING AND PROJECT ASSISTANT EVALUATIONS\nEach employing unit shall establish an evaluation process to review performance of duties and ability. Employees shall be informed of the evaluation process and criteria for evaluation at the start of the period for which they are being evaluated.\nTeaching Assistant evaluations may include input from the following sources, but should not consist solely of student evaluations:\n\nIndividual student evaluation of the teaching performance of a Teaching Assistant in a course in which the student is enrolled.\nFaculty and staff review of employee performance. If such a review includes an assessment of a Teaching Assistant’s laboratory or classroom performance, the assessment shall include at least one (1) visit by a faculty or staff member. A Teaching Assistant will be given at least twenty-four (24) hours’ notice prior to the initial visit in a semester for this purpose. Prior notice is not required for faculty and/or staff visits for any other purpose, including subsequent visits for evaluation purposes.\nSelf review.\nPeer Review.\n\nPerformance will be reviewed at least once during the term of the appointment. Copies of written performance evaluation reports will be provided to employees. A copy of this report and any written evaluations will be given to the employee who will have the right to make a written response to be placed in their personnel file. Departments are encouraged to provide supervision and evaluation throughout the appointment period.\nIn the event review of Teaching Assistant or Project Assistant teaching performance includes a committee, the committee shall have a faculty majority; its membership may include employee representatives chosen by employees and may include other staff and students.\nIf student evaluations are part of the Teaching or Project Assistant evaluation process, employees will be notified at least forty-eight hours prior to distribution of student evaluation forms. Student evaluations may be part of the Teaching or Project Assistant evaluation process, but shall not be the sole method for evaluating Teaching Assistants.\nRESEARCH ASSISTANT EVALUATIONS\nResearch Assistant performance should be evaluated at least annually. These evaluations should include input from 1 and 2, and may also include, but may not be based solely upon, input from 3,\n\nFaculty/staff supervisor review of employee performance. If such a review includes an assessment of a RAs laboratory performance, the assessment shall include at least one (1) visit by a faculty/staff member.\nThesis Committee Review.\nSelf review and/or Individual Development Plan (IDP) Process.\n\nIf the evaluation process is implemented by a thesis committee, the composition of such committee shall be in accordance with established graduate program and Graduate School procedures.\nComments and data that evidence illegal discrimination shall be excluded from consideration, and the presence of such comments shall be considered in weighing the evaluation as a whole.\nSince RA appointments involve a combined academic and employment experience, there may be a separate academic evaluation made by the supervisor and/or enrolling graduate program. The research assistant and their supervisor should have periodic and ongoing conversations to discuss research progress.\nDiscrimination, Discriminatory Harassment and Retaliation\nThe University of Wisconsin–Madison is committed to providing equal opportunity and equal access and to complying with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations and University of Wisconsin System and university non-discrimination policies and procedures, including Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, which prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability, and the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of age.\nThe University strives to provide a workplace and educational environment free from harassment.

This compensatory time off shall be scheduled by the employee, with the prior approval of the University, consistent with the operational needs of the department.\nThere are 9 legal holidays under UW-5050 Personal and Legal Holidays:\n\nJanuary 1 (New Year’s Day)\nThird Monday in January (Martin Luther King Jr. Day)\nLast Monday in May (Memorial Day)\nJuly 4 (Independence Day)\nFirst Monday in September (Labor Day)\nFourth Thursday in November (Thanksgiving Day)\nDecember 24 (Christmas Eve Day)\nDecember 25 (Christmas Day)\nDecember 31 (New Year’s Eve Day)\n\nRELIGIOUS OBSERVANCES\nThe University recognizes the importance of giving Employees time off for religious observances and recognizes that religious holidays do not always coincide with state legal holidays. Employees who face a conflict between a work requirement and any anticipated religious observance should be given an alternative means of meeting the work requirement, provided that the Employee notifies their supervisor in the first two weeks of the appointment period of the specific day or dates that will be needed for these observances. Where the appointment period includes two academic semesters, notice must be given within the first two (2) weeks of each semester. When the religious observance falls within the first two (2) weeks of an appointment period (including summer sessions), the Employee should give as much advance notice as possible to their supervisor. Supervisors may set reasonable limits on the total number of days granted for religious observances by any one (1) Employee, subject to Dean/Director approval.\nFLEXIBLE SPENDING ACCOUNT\nThe University offers Employees the opportunity to participate in the Employee-funded Flexible Spending Account program as administered under provisions of Chapter 40. Wis. Stats.\n \n1Based on a 1.0 full-time equivalent (FTE) of 40 hours.\n2As stated in the definition of a Research Assistant, an appointment as a research assistant is appropriate if the activity performed by the research assistant is primarily for the benefit of the individual’s course of study and research and applicable to the individual’s thesis or dissertation. Tasks which are irrelevant to the appointee’s academic program or repetitive beyond that which is necessary to achieve excellence in the activity are not appropriate for an individual appointed as a research assistant.\n3Sometimes research requires long and/or unusual hours to complete a task or to gain mastery of a technique.\n4For example, a Research Assistant appointed to an annual appointment at .50 FTE (or 50%) will earn 90 hours vacation per fiscal year.\nProcedure:\nGRIEVANCE PROCEDURE\nAny Employee who discusses, inquires about, or participates in the grievance procedure may do so openly and shall not be subject to intimidation, discipline, or retaliation because of such activity.\nDefinition and Procedure\nA grievance is defined as, and limited to, a written complaint identifying an alleged violation of a specific employment provision(s) of the Graduate Assistant Policies and Procedures and remedy sought. Grievances may be filed by a Teaching, Project or Research Assistant. Academic-related grievances are pursued through processes described in graduate program handbooks with subsequent appeals following Graduate School policy. An employee who files a grievance is referred to as the grievant. A grievant is encouraged to discuss the complaint with their immediate supervisor as well as other campus resources (e.g. department chair, dean/director, human resources representative, etc.) prior to filing a grievance. The primary purpose of this procedure is to secure equitable solutions to the grievance(s) at the most immediate level possible.\nThe word “days” for the purpose of this article shall be working days and shall not include weekends, university holidays, spring recess or the period from the last day of exams of the fall semester to the first day of the next instructional period, or days in which the grievant is required to leave Madison for extended work-related purposes (e.g. field work or conferences). All time limits may be modified by mutual consent.\nTo the fullest extent possible, a grievance shall contain a clear and concise statement of the grievance and indicate the issue(s) involved, the relief sought, the date(s) the incident or violation took place and the specific policy section or sections involved. The grievance shall be signed and dated by the grievant(s) and representative (if any).\nA grievant shall be notified of the ability to have the assistance of a personal representative. A grievant has the right to find representation of their choosing during the grievance process. The designated representative may change at any time during the process. If representation is chosen and the representative is an attorney, the grievant must alert the University. The grievant cannot be compelled to meet without their representative, however it is the grievant’s responsibility to find representation that can meet within the allotted time frame.\nMeeting with Grievance Representatives.\nA grievant may consult with their representative regarding a grievance, or process a grievance, during working hours for a reasonable period of time, provided that this meeting does not interfere with scheduled work activities.\nGrievances should be presented as soon as reasonably possible, typically no later than sixty (60) days from the date the grievant first became aware of, or should have become aware of with the exercise of reasonable diligence, the cause of such grievance.\nSteps One and Two of the grievance procedure may be waived by mutual agreement.\nThe Grievant and representative (if chosen) shall have the right to file a grievance when any provision of these procedures are alleged to have been violated. Possible relief may include extending the grievance timeframe to ensure that these procedures are followed.\nGrievances may continue after graduation or voluntary separation. In cases of involuntary termination, grievances may be filed by former employees, but must adhere to the relevant timeline(s).\nReceipt of a grievance for purposes of meeting timeline requirements at each step is determined by the date stamp on the grievance form (if hand delivered), digital timestamp (if filed electronically), or envelope postmark (if delivered by U.S. Mail).\nGrievances not answered by the employer within the designated time limits in any step of the grievance procedure may be appealed to the next step within ten (10) days of the expiration of the designated time limits.\nGrievance Steps\nStep One:\nThe grievant must file a written statement with the appointing department/unit chair/director or their designee specifying the grievant’s name, a clear and concise statement of the grievance and the issue(s) involved, the date(s) the incident or violation took place and the specific policy section or sections involved, and the relief sought, The grievance shall be signed and dated by the grievant(s) and representative (if any).\nWithin twenty (20) days of receipt of the written grievance, the department chair/director or designee will meet with the grievant and their representative (if chosen) to hear the grievance and will return a written answer to the grievant and their representative (if chosen) no later than ten (10) days after this meeting. This answer will include a copy of the grievance procedure appeal process timeline, a list of resources and relevant contact information of personnel hearing future steps.\nStep Two:\nIf the decision in Step One is not accepted by the grievant, the grievant shall have 10 days from receipt of the answer in Step One to file an appeal with the appropriate appointing department/unit Dean/Director or designee. The Dean/Director or designee will meet with the grievant and their representative (if chosen) within twenty (20) days from receipt of the appeal of Step One and attempt to resolve the grievance. The Dean/Director or designee will provide the grievant and their representative (if chosen) with a written response to the grievance no later than ten (10) days after this meeting.\nStep Three:\nIf the decision in Step Two is not accepted by the grievant, the grievant shall have 10 days from the receipt of the answer in Step Two to file an appeal with the Office of Human Resources (OHR), specifically the Office of Workforce Relations (OWR). The OHR-OWR office will meet with the grievant and their representative (if chosen) within twenty (20) days from receipt of the appeal of Step Two.\nThe OHR-OWR will provide a written decision to the grievant and their representative (if chosen), no later than ten (10) days after this meeting.\nStep Four:\nGrievances that are not resolved under the foregoing procedure may be appealed to the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission (WERC) by the grievant within twenty (20) days from the date of the answer in Step Three. If an unresolved grievance is not appealed to the WERC within twenty (20) days of the final resolution of Step Three, it shall be considered terminated on the basis of the Third Step answer of the responding party without prejudice or precedent in the resolution of future grievances. The issue as stated on the Third Step grievance and any amendments made thereon, in writing, at the Third Step grievance meeting shall constitute the sole and entire subject matter to be heard by the WERC hearing examiner, unless the parties agree to modify the scope of the hearing. The WERC hearing examiner will be selected by mutual consent of both parties. If the parties have utilized mediation, no reference to mediation shall be admitted as evidence in the hearing.\nWhere two (2) or more grievances are appealed to the WERC by the same individual or regarding a substantially similar matter, an effort will be made by the parties to have the grievances heard by the same hearing examiner.\nThe University will bear the cost of the WERC hearing fees.\nThe hearing examiner shall not have jurisdiction or authority to add to, amend, modify, nullify, or ignore in any way the provisions of University Policy.\nThe decision of the hearing examiner will be forwarded to the Chancellor or Chancellor’s designee for review. The Chancellor or Chancellor’s designee shall release a decision either accepting, rejecting, or modifying the hearing examiner’s decision. The Chancellor’s decision will be final and binding on both parties.\nThe decision of the Chancellor or Chancellor’s designee will be rendered within thirty (30) days from receipt of the WERC’s decision. If no decision is made by the Chancellor or Chancellor’s designee within thirty (30) days, then the decision of the WERC becomes final.\nRetroactivity.\nSettlement of grievances may or may not be retroactive as the equities of particular cases may demand. In any case, the maximum period of retroactivity allowed shall be a date not earlier than sixty (60) days prior to the date of initiation of the written grievance in Step One unless the circumstances of the case made it impossible for the employee to know they had grounds for such claim prior to that date, in which case the retroactivity shall be limited to a period of ninety (90) days prior to the date the grievance was initiated in writing. Employees who voluntarily terminate their employment will have their grievances immediately withdrawn and will not benefit by any later settlement of a group grievance. Graduation shall not be considered voluntary termination for purposes of retroactivity.\nExclusive Procedure.\nThe grievance procedure set out above shall be exclusive and shall replace any other grievance procedure for adjustment of any disputes arising from the application and interpretation of these policies and procedures.\nFurther, in a group grievance, only one (1) grievant shall be the spokesperson for the group. Group grievances must be so designated at each step of the grievance procedure and set forth a list of all employees covered by the grievance. No employees may be added to the list of group grievants after the second step hearing. Relief is restricted to those employees identified by name in the group grievance. Individual grievances which meet the definition of group grievances as contained herein shall be consolidated at each step of the grievance procedure whenever possible. Individual grievances which do not specifically meet the definition of group grievance, contained herein, may be consolidated by mutual agreement.\nDiscipline.\nThe University has the ability to suspend, discharge or take other appropriate disciplinary action against employees for just cause (defined below). If any discipline is taken against an employee, the employee will receive a copy of this disciplinary action. An employee who alleges that such action was without just cause may appeal a suspension or discharge beginning with the second step of the grievance procedure. An employee shall be entitled to the presence of a grievance representative at an investigatory interview if he/she requests one and if the employee has reasonable grounds to believe that the interview may be used to support disciplinary action against him/her. Whenever it is appropriate, the Employer shall give the employee and the grievance representative advance notice of the Employer’s intent to hold an investigatory interview.\nJust Cause\nThe basic elements of just cause have been reduced by arbitrator Carroll R. Daugherty to seven tests outlined below:\n\nNOTICE: Did the Employer give to the employee forewarning or foreknowledge of the possible or probable consequences of the employee’s disciplinary conduct?\nREASONABLE RULE OR ORDER: Was the Employer’s rules or managerial order reasonably related to (a) the orderly, efficient, and safe operation of the Employer’s business, and (b) the performance that the Employer might properly expect of the employee?\nINVESTIGATION: Did the Employer, before administering the discipline to an employee, make an effort to discover whether the employee did in fact violate or disobey a rule or order of management?\nFAIR INVESTIGATION: Was the Employer’s investigation conducted fairly and objectively?\nPROOF: At the investigation, did the “judge” obtain substantial evidence or proof that the employee was guilty as charged?\nEQUAL TREATMENT: Has the Employer applied its rules, orders and penalties evenhandedly and without discrimination to all employees?\nPENALTY: Was the degree of discipline administered by the Employer in a particular case reasonably related to (a) the seriousness of the employee’s proven offense, and (b) the record of the employee in his service of the Employer?\n\nExclusion of Probationary Employees.\nThe release of probationary employees shall not be subject to the grievance procedure.\nRelated UW-Madison Policies:\nUW-5050 Personal and Legal Holidays\nUW-5054 Paid Parental Leave\nUW-1238 Graduate Assistantships\nRelated UW–Madison Documents, Web Pages, or Other Resources:\nGraduate Assistant Payment of Segregated Fees Policy\nLactation Rooms – Office of Child Care and Family Resources\nExternal References:\nTuition Remission\nHealth insurance rates and information are found: hr.wisc.edu/benefits\nTravel and Reimbursement – Division of Business Services\nSection 7(r) of the Fair Labor Standards Act – Break Time for Nursing Mothers Provision\nOffice of Environment, Health, and Safety.\nOffice of Environmental and Occupational Health\nEqual Opportunity Complaint Investigation\nADA Resources\nCampus Disability Coordinator\nMcBurney Disability Resources Center\nGraduate School appeal process\nPublic Records Law (Wisconsin state statute 19.31-39)\nTo make a Public Records Request send an email through the UW–Madison Public Records service mailbox: public_records@wisc.edu\nTo view additional information about the Public Records Law, go to compliance.wisc.edu and click on the Public Records link\nApproval Authority:\nVice Chancellor for Finance and Administration\nPolicy Manager:\nAssociate Vice Chancellor/Chief Human Resources Officer\nContact:\nEmployment Relations Director -- Megan Dzyuba, wr@ohr.wisc.edu, (608) 890-3663\nRevised Dates:\n01-28-2020, 02-09-2024, 02-14-2025\nRetrieved:\n08-05-2025 11:11:25\n[GRID_TABLE]\nLayout for printing\nPolicy Number:\nUW-5082\nResponsible Office:\nOffice of Human Resources\nLayout for printing\nPolicy Number:\nUW-5082\nResponsible Office:\nOffice of Human Resources\nDefinitions:\nDay\nA calendar day, unless otherwise specifically stated.\nYear\nFiscal year (from July 1 through June 30), unless otherwise indicated.\nEmployee\nA graduate student registered at the University, who is currently appointed as a teaching assistant, research assistant or project assistant (including reader/grader).\nUniversity\nThe University of Wisconsin–Madison and University of Wisconsin-Extension.\nDepartment\nAny administrative unit, center or institute which directly employs teaching, project assistants and/or research assistants.\nGraduate Program\nAn academic program which has admitted the student to matriculated graduate study at UW–Madison.\nWork time\nScheduled and Unscheduled work time.\nScheduled work time\nThat portion of work time which is normally scheduled by or at the direction of the University.\nUnscheduled work time\nThat portion of work time which is flexible and normally self-scheduled by the employee.\nProject Assistant (PA)\nThis title designates graduate students enrolled in UW–Madison who are employed to assist with research, training, administrative responsibilities or other academic programs or projects under the supervision of a member or members of the faculty or academic staff, as defined in s. 36.05(1) or (8), Wis. Stats. Work performed is primarily for the benefit of the University. This title does not include a graduate student who does work which is primarily for the benefit of the student’s own learning and research which is independent or self-directed.\nTeaching Assistant (TA) – Teaching Assistant -Senior\nThis title is appropriate for graduate students enrolled at UW–Madison who have been assigned teaching or curriculum development responsibilities in an instructional department under the supervision of an academic staff or faculty member as defined in s 36.05(8), Wis. Stats who has instructional responsibilities for the course. The teaching assistant title should not be used for a graduate student who is responsible for teaching a course in lieu of a faculty member, and should not be used as a substitute for the lecturer (SA) title.\nResearch Assistant (RA)\nA research assistant is a UW–Madison graduate student working towards a Master’s or Ph.D. degree. An appointment as a research assistant is appropriate if the activity performed by the research assistant is primarily for the benefit of the individual’s course of study and research and applicable to the individual’s thesis or dissertation. Tasks which are irrelevant to the appointee’s academic program or repetitive beyond that which is necessary to achieve excellence in the activity are not appropriate for an individual appointed as a research assistant. The appointee is required to register for the appropriate number of graduate courses and research credits to satisfy full-time enrollment. The appointee must maintain enrollment commensurate with their program requirements. A research assistant should be supported from research funds only if the activities of the research assistant are necessary for the research project objectives providing funding. Research assistants are defined as employees by s. 111.81(7)(gm) Wisc. Stats.\nProject Assistant-Grader/Reader\nThis title designates graduate students enrolled at UW–Madison who are employed to assist with grading at the UW–Madison. These positions are paid a fixed hourly rate.\nPolicy:\nPERSONNEL LISTS\nEmployees may make Public Records Requests for personnel and public directory information.\nPublic Records Law (Wisconsin state statute 19.31-39)\nTo make a Public Records Request send an email through the UW–Madison Public Records service mailbox: public_records@wisc.edu\nTo view additional information about the Public Records Law, go to compliance.wisc.edu and click on the Public Records link.

Stat.§ 19.35(3)(c). In addition, the university may require prepayment of any fees if the total amount exceeds $5.00. Wis. Stat.§ 19.35(3)(f).\nAs required by the public records law, the university responds to records requests as soon as is practicable and without delay.\nTo view an example of a Public Records Request for personnel information, see (include link to an example request such as the one below).\nTo request public directory information, see (include link when automated system becomes available).\nAPPOINTMENTS\nTerm of Appointment\nAn appointment of a Teaching, Project or Research Assistant within an employing department shall be for a specific period, up to one year. The academic admitting graduate program may make financial support guarantees to employees for a period longer than one year, and such guarantees may include a variety of appointments, including, but not limited to, teaching, research, and project assistantships. Satisfactory academic progress as defined by the Graduate School and the graduate program handbook is required for reappointment.\nEmployment Criteria\nDepartments or graduate programs that employ Teaching, Project or Research Assistants shall establish criteria for use in making appointments to these titles. These criteria may include but are not limited to such factors as academic record, letters of recommendation, previous relevant experience, and factors related to the academic and research missions of the department.\nCopies of established criteria will be available on request to employees. Departments and graduate programs are strongly encouraged to also make this information available on their websites. It is important to note, the employing department is not necessarily the same as the graduate program.\nLetters of Appointment\nAll newly appointed employees shall receive a letter of appointment from the employing department which specifies the supervisor, appointment title, experience classification (if any), appointment percentage, effective dates, salary or stipend level, length of probationary period (if any), hours of work or work assignment if known, and for eligible employees notification that insurance including health insurance and other benefits may be available and have deadlines for enrollment; the letter will also indicate a person or office to contact for information regarding benefits associated with the appointment. Letters of appointment shall be delivered to the employee before the start of employment.\nIn addition, reappointed employees shall receive a letter of appointment from the employing department which specifies the supervisor, appointment title, experience classification (if any), appointment percentage, effective dates, salary level, and hours of work or work assignment if known.\nProbationary Period\n\nExcept as indicated in B., a TA or PA shall serve a probationary period equivalent to one (1) academic semester in length for an academic semester length appointment or academic year appointment. Two (2) separate two (2) month summer session appointments for TAs will also satisfy the probationary period. All other PA appointments will be for a probationary period of six (6) months. A probationary period is the defined period of time during which the probationary employee may be terminated without recourse to the grievance procedure. The decision to terminate an employee’s appointment during the probationary period requires the approval of the chair/director of the department/unit (or designee). Where the employee is supervised directly by the chair/director, termination of an appointment during the probationary period requires the approval of the dean/director (or designee). An employee must be notified of termination in writing, during the probationary period, either delivered in person or electronically. No employee shall be required to serve more than one (1) probationary period in any one department.For a TA or PA who receives a subsequent appointment involving a change in title or department, the appointing department may require a permissive probationary period of the same duration as described above. The employing department shall make a determination as to whether the appointee shall serve a permissive probationary period and shall notify that employee in the letter of appointment. The employing department may waive these permissive probationary periods at any time. The employee shall be notified by the University of the determination to waive such employee’s probationary period. The University shall include consideration of the employee’s performance in their prior appointment in determining whether or not to waive the probation. This waiver is not subject to the grievance procedure.\nIf an employee’s performance is deemed unsatisfactory during their probation the supervisor and appointing department may extend the employee’s probation to no more than double the original length of the probationary period. If a probation is extended, the employee must be notified in the same manner as probationary termination.\nIn the case of an employee whose performance is deemed unsatisfactory during their probation, the supervisor and appointing department may establish a remedial program. This program may be carried out during the original or extended probationary period, or during a period of non-appointment prior to a renewed appointment. Participation in a remedial program shall not be considered part of the employee’s work duties.\nRAs do not serve probationary periods and should receive, at a minimum, annual feedback regarding their performance from their supervisor, in consultation with the employing department and graduate program. An RA should be notified in writing of where they are not making adequate progress and prepare a remedial plan to correct the deficiencies.\n\nAppointment Percentage for Project and Teaching Assistants\nDuring a semester in an academic year, employees who hold appointments as Teaching Assistants or Project Assistants shall have appointments at a level totaling at least one-third time (33%), except as provided below. Total appointments for employees may be less than one-third time with the agreement of the employee. Such appointments will require approval by the Department and Dean/Director. Employees appointed on a temporary emergency basis and all hourly pay basis Project Assistants may be appointed at a level less than one-third time.\nAppointment Percentage for Research Assistants\nDuring a semester in an academic year, employees who hold appointments as Research Assistants shall have appointments at a level totaling at least one-half time (50%)1 except as provided below. There may be extenuating reasons for RAs to be appointed less than 50%. Such appointments will require approval by the Department and Dean/Director.\nEmployment Information\nThe University will make information about openings and application procedures for Teaching Assistants or Project Assistantships available to ensure that all interested graduate students are given an opportunity to apply. Interested graduate students may follow up their interests at the department level.\nDepartments employing or anticipating the employment of Teaching Assistants or Project Assistants will maintain posted information as follows:\n\nInformation about procedures for applying for Teaching and Project Assistantships including the name or location of an office where inquiries or applications may be made.\nA listing of courses that typically have Teaching Assistants assigned or are expected to have Teaching Assistants assigned. This list will be updated to include special course opportunities that may become available. A separate list of summer sessions course possibilities will be posted if applicable.\nInformation about other Teaching or Project Assistantships that may become available.\n\nEmployment information will be posted electronically in a location designated by the department and easily accessible to graduate students. The University will maintain a web site on which open positions shall be posted. Open positions do not include: positions reserved for guarantees of support and/or recruiting offers; reappointments (continuing positions); and positions that must be filled within seven (7) days for emergency purposes.\nTeaching Assistant Course Assignments\nTeaching Assistants may request assignment to particular courses, and when in the department’s judgment the Teaching Assistant is qualified to teach the course, the course supervisor is agreeable to the assignment, and the department can staff its courses in a manner which it deems satisfactory, the Teaching Assistant’s request shall be granted.\nDepartments shall notify appointed Teaching Assistants of their tentative course assignments, if known, no later than August 1 for fall semester courses and December 1 for spring semester courses. Such notification does not guarantee the assignment.\nTeaching Assistant and Project Assistant Duties\nIn assigning duties to Teaching Assistants or Project Assistants:\nThe department and supervising staff member shall establish the required duties of the employee and the supervising staff member shall discuss these duties with the employee at the beginning of the appointment period.\nIt is understood that Teaching Assistants and Project Assistants are engaged in professional activities of such a nature that the output produced or the result accomplished cannot be precisely measured in relation to a given period of time. In determining the amount of time expected for an employee assignment, consideration shall be given to such factors as type of instruction, number of students instructed, and all other factors, including those specific to the course or group of courses to which instructional duty expectations apply. Fluctuations above and below the hours reflected in the appointment level are expected, corresponding to individual distinctions such as experience. Recognizing that Teaching and Project Assistants are embarked on a program of career and professional development, employees are encouraged to discuss duties with the supervising staff member, at the outset of the appointment and as questions may arise during the appointment.\nIn the case of Teaching Assistants, each department shall provide the employee and their supervisor with an appointment worksheet with the appointment letter at least three (3) days before signed workload sheets are to be returned by the employee, prior to each term of appointment (Fall, Spring and Summer). Copies of these estimates shall be provided to course supervisors.\nIn addition, the employee and their supervisor will have an opportunity to review that worksheet at the commencement of the Teaching Assistant’s employment and throughout the semester. The worksheet shall indicate the approximate distribution of hours to be spent on the various duties required by the appointment and shall include hours for -mandated training time and for any training required by the University and deemed necessary for the performance of the employee’s duties.\nThe function of the aforementioned worksheet is advisory. Neither the specific distribution of hours among tasks on this worksheet, nor deviation from the apportionment of hours shall be construed as binding or grievable.\nDepartments are encouraged to establish workload committees consisting of faculty, staff and graduate students who are current or former Teaching Assistants or Project Assistants to review new and existing workloads for Teaching and Project Assistants annually, identify persistent workload problems and recommend remedies to the department. If a workload committee does not exist, one may be established at the request of a majority of the Departmental Teaching and Project Assistants.\nThe appointment level for Teaching Assistants or Project Assistants shall be based on the department’s determination of the amount of time it should normally take to perform the assigned duties including orientation and training. Satisfactory performance of these duties shall not require an effort exceeding three hundred and sixty (360) hours per semester for a halftime (50%) academic year pay basis appointment; one thousand and forty (1040) hours per year for a halftime (50%) annual pay basis appointment; eight hundred and sixty-seven (867) hours per ten-month period for a halftime (50%) ten-month pay basis appointment; or a proportional number of hours for other durations or percentages of appointment.\nAll Teaching Assistant or Project Assistant duties required by the supervising staff member or the department shall be fairly within the scope of employment and shall be included in the calculation of required hours.\nThe number of hours are stated for the full appointment period, but hours needed to carry out required duties may fluctuate over portions of the appointment period. As soon as the University becomes aware of substantial fluctuations which will occur the employee will be so notified. Except for full time (100%) appointments, if the University knew or should with the exercise of reasonable diligence have known of a substantial increase in the number of hours needed to carry out required duties during a particular period and did not so notify the employee, the employee shall not be required to work more than forty (40) hours in any one week.\nInformal discussion between a supervisor and an employee is likely to be the most effective way to resolve problems in assignment of duties. An employee who finds that the assigned duties appear to require more time than is allocated should immediately notify, and consult with, the supervisor or Department Chair (or designee), who shall reconsider the factors used to determine the amount of time expected. The supervisor and the department may direct either an adjustment in the duties or, pending approval of funding, an adjustment in the appointment level.\nAn employee may submit to the supervisor or Department Chair (or designee) a written request that the duties required be revised. A response shall be made within one (1) week of the written request unless the employee and the department mutually agree to a longer period. If the employee is dissatisfied with the response or no response is forthcoming, the employee may file a grievance. No such grievance will be considered unless there has been a prior written request to make an adjustment.\nA department or supervisor may establish reasonable prerequisites which a Teaching Assistant or Project Assistant must meet in order to hold a particular position and determine whether those prerequisites have been met before the Teaching or Project Assistant becomes eligible to perform those duties. Any prerequisites shall be posted along with the job opening. If a Teaching or Project Assistant requests to hold a position and has not met the prerequisites, the employee shall not be paid for time involved in meeting the prerequisites if the request is granted. If a Teaching or Project Assistant is assigned to a course which the employee has not requested and for which she or he does not meet the prerequisites, the employee shall be paid for the time which is necessary to satisfactorily meet those prerequisites.\nResearch Assistant Activities\nIn assigning activities to RAs, the nature of the work is different than TAs and PAs. RAs are typically not assigned specific duties2. RAs are working toward developing skills in their specific field, and therefore the nature of skills and rate of acquisition of these skills may vary greatly across disciplines and individuals. It is therefore not possible to establish blanket descriptions of duties for RAs that uniformly apply to all in the title.\nThe research assistant and supervising faculty/staff member shall collaboratively develop a research program plan. These research program plans are encouraged to be reviewed by the department chair, program chair, and/or thesis committee.\nIt is understood that RAs are engaged in professional activities of such a nature that the output produced or the result accomplished cannot be precisely measured in relation to a given period of time. Fluctuations above and below the hours reflected in the appointment level are expected. Recognizing that RAs are embarked on a program of educational, career and professional development, employees are encouraged to discuss both a plan of academic study as well as the research program plan with the supervising faculty/staff member, at the outset of the appointment and as questions arise during the appointment3.\nThe employee and their supervisor will have an opportunity to review expectations at the commencement of the RAs employment. The employee and their supervisor shall have periodic meetings to discuss research progress.\nThe function of the aforementioned expectation review is advisory. Neither the specific distribution of hours among tasks, nor deviation from the apportionment of effort shall be construed as binding or grievable.\nInformal discussion between a supervisor and an employee is likely to be the most effective way to resolve problems. Employees are also encouraged to consult their academic program director, handbook and/or thesis committee for additional guidance. An employee who finds that the research plan appears to require more time, involves inappropriate work duties or duties incommensurate with the activities, should consult with the supervisor, who shall reconsider the factors used to determine the expectations. The supervisor and/or the department/unit may adjust the activities.\nFor RA appointments the grievance/appeal procedure regarding the assigned activities is documented by the admitting program’s graduate program handbook. Additional resources may be available based on your employing unit or college. In the event a satisfactory resolution is not achieved, the RA can utilize the Graduate School appeal process.\nWork Surroundings\nThe Department will provide appropriate resources and an adequate and safe work environment necessary for the performance of job responsibilities including access to an office or shared workspace in which to conduct their work. Examples include but are not limited to: access to a printer and copier, access to a computer or laptop, office/instructional supplies, software necessary for instructional tasks / job duties, a departmental mailbox, personal protective equipment, and access to equipment operation manuals, records of equipment safety inspection reports, appropriate lockout/tag out procedures, and hazardous chemical Safety Data Sheets (SDSs). If an employee believes that additional resources or facilities are needed to perform such duties, then they are encouraged to contact their immediate supervisor for the purpose of discussing such needs.\nDepartments are encouraged to consult with a representative group of Teaching or Project Assistants to determine what resources may be necessary for the performance of TA/PA job responsibilities.

Grievances may be filed by a Teaching, Project or Research Assistant. Academic-related grievances are pursued through processes described in graduate program handbooks with subsequent appeals following Graduate School policy. An employee who files a grievance is referred to as the grievant. A grievant is encouraged to discuss the complaint with their immediate supervisor as well as other campus resources (e.g. department chair, dean/director, human resources representative, etc.) prior to filing a grievance. The primary purpose of this procedure is to secure equitable solutions to the grievance(s) at the most immediate level possible.\nThe word “days” for the purpose of this article shall be working days and shall not include weekends, university holidays, spring recess or the period from the last day of exams of the fall semester to the first day of the next instructional period, or days in which the grievant is required to leave Madison for extended work-related purposes (e.g. field work or conferences). All time limits may be modified by mutual consent.\nTo the fullest extent possible, a grievance shall contain a clear and concise statement of the grievance and indicate the issue(s) involved, the relief sought, the date(s) the incident or violation took place and the specific policy section or sections involved. The grievance shall be signed and dated by the grievant(s) and representative (if any).\nA grievant shall be notified of the ability to have the assistance of a personal representative. A grievant has the right to find representation of their choosing during the grievance process. The designated representative may change at any time during the process. If representation is chosen and the representative is an attorney, the grievant must alert the University. The grievant cannot be compelled to meet without their representative, however it is the grievant’s responsibility to find representation that can meet within the allotted time frame.\nMeeting with Grievance Representatives.\nA grievant may consult with their representative regarding a grievance, or process a grievance, during working hours for a reasonable period of time, provided that this meeting does not interfere with scheduled work activities.\nGrievances should be presented as soon as reasonably possible, typically no later than sixty (60) days from the date the grievant first became aware of, or should have become aware of with the exercise of reasonable diligence, the cause of such grievance.\nSteps One and Two of the grievance procedure may be waived by mutual agreement.\nThe Grievant and representative (if chosen) shall have the right to file a grievance when any provision of these procedures are alleged to have been violated. Possible relief may include extending the grievance timeframe to ensure that these procedures are followed.\nGrievances may continue after graduation or voluntary separation. In cases of involuntary termination, grievances may be filed by former employees, but must adhere to the relevant timeline(s).\nReceipt of a grievance for purposes of meeting timeline requirements at each step is determined by the date stamp on the grievance form (if hand delivered), digital timestamp (if filed electronically), or envelope postmark (if delivered by U.S. Mail).\nGrievances not answered by the employer within the designated time limits in any step of the grievance procedure may be appealed to the next step within ten (10) days of the expiration of the designated time limits.\nGrievance Steps\nStep One:\nThe grievant must file a written statement with the appointing department/unit chair/director or their designee specifying the grievant’s name, a clear and concise statement of the grievance and the issue(s) involved, the date(s) the incident or violation took place and the specific policy section or sections involved, and the relief sought, The grievance shall be signed and dated by the grievant(s) and representative (if any).\nWithin twenty (20) days of receipt of the written grievance, the department chair/director or designee will meet with the grievant and their representative (if chosen) to hear the grievance and will return a written answer to the grievant and their representative (if chosen) no later than ten (10) days after this meeting. This answer will include a copy of the grievance procedure appeal process timeline, a list of resources and relevant contact information of personnel hearing future steps.\nStep Two:\nIf the decision in Step One is not accepted by the grievant, the grievant shall have 10 days from receipt of the answer in Step One to file an appeal with the appropriate appointing department/unit Dean/Director or designee. The Dean/Director or designee will meet with the grievant and their representative (if chosen) within twenty (20) days from receipt of the appeal of Step One and attempt to resolve the grievance. The Dean/Director or designee will provide the grievant and their representative (if chosen) with a written response to the grievance no later than ten (10) days after this meeting.\nStep Three:\nIf the decision in Step Two is not accepted by the grievant, the grievant shall have 10 days from the receipt of the answer in Step Two to file an appeal with the Office of Human Resources (OHR), specifically the Office of Workforce Relations (OWR). The OHR-OWR office will meet with the grievant and their representative (if chosen) within twenty (20) days from receipt of the appeal of Step Two.\nThe OHR-OWR will provide a written decision to the grievant and their representative (if chosen), no later than ten (10) days after this meeting.\nStep Four:\nGrievances that are not resolved under the foregoing procedure may be appealed to the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission (WERC) by the grievant within twenty (20) days from the date of the answer in Step Three. If an unresolved grievance is not appealed to the WERC within twenty (20) days of the final resolution of Step Three, it shall be considered terminated on the basis of the Third Step answer of the responding party without prejudice or precedent in the resolution of future grievances. The issue as stated on the Third Step grievance and any amendments made thereon, in writing, at the Third Step grievance meeting shall constitute the sole and entire subject matter to be heard by the WERC hearing examiner, unless the parties agree to modify the scope of the hearing. The WERC hearing examiner will be selected by mutual consent of both parties. If the parties have utilized mediation, no reference to mediation shall be admitted as evidence in the hearing.\nWhere two (2) or more grievances are appealed to the WERC by the same individual or regarding a substantially similar matter, an effort will be made by the parties to have the grievances heard by the same hearing examiner.\nThe University will bear the cost of the WERC hearing fees.\nThe hearing examiner shall not have jurisdiction or authority to add to, amend, modify, nullify, or ignore in any way the provisions of University Policy.\nThe decision of the hearing examiner will be forwarded to the Chancellor or Chancellor’s designee for review. The Chancellor or Chancellor’s designee shall release a decision either accepting, rejecting, or modifying the hearing examiner’s decision. The Chancellor’s decision will be final and binding on both parties.\nThe decision of the Chancellor or Chancellor’s designee will be rendered within thirty (30) days from receipt of the WERC’s decision. If no decision is made by the Chancellor or Chancellor’s designee within thirty (30) days, then the decision of the WERC becomes final.\nRetroactivity.\nSettlement of grievances may or may not be retroactive as the equities of particular cases may demand. In any case, the maximum period of retroactivity allowed shall be a date not earlier than sixty (60) days prior to the date of initiation of the written grievance in Step One unless the circumstances of the case made it impossible for the employee to know they had grounds for such claim prior to that date, in which case the retroactivity shall be limited to a period of ninety (90) days prior to the date the grievance was initiated in writing. Employees who voluntarily terminate their employment will have their grievances immediately withdrawn and will not benefit by any later settlement of a group grievance. Graduation shall not be considered voluntary termination for purposes of retroactivity.\nExclusive Procedure.\nThe grievance procedure set out above shall be exclusive and shall replace any other grievance procedure for adjustment of any disputes arising from the application and interpretation of these policies and procedures.\nFurther, in a group grievance, only one (1) grievant shall be the spokesperson for the group. Group grievances must be so designated at each step of the grievance procedure and set forth a list of all employees covered by the grievance. No employees may be added to the list of group grievants after the second step hearing. Relief is restricted to those employees identified by name in the group grievance. Individual grievances which meet the definition of group grievances as contained herein shall be consolidated at each step of the grievance procedure whenever possible. Individual grievances which do not specifically meet the definition of group grievance, contained herein, may be consolidated by mutual agreement.\nDiscipline.\nThe University has the ability to suspend, discharge or take other appropriate disciplinary action against employees for just cause (defined below). If any discipline is taken against an employee, the employee will receive a copy of this disciplinary action. An employee who alleges that such action was without just cause may appeal a suspension or discharge beginning with the second step of the grievance procedure. An employee shall be entitled to the presence of a grievance representative at an investigatory interview if he/she requests one and if the employee has reasonable grounds to believe that the interview may be used to support disciplinary action against him/her. Whenever it is appropriate, the Employer shall give the employee and the grievance representative advance notice of the Employer’s intent to hold an investigatory interview.\nJust Cause\nThe basic elements of just cause have been reduced by arbitrator Carroll R. Daugherty to seven tests outlined below:\n\nNOTICE: Did the Employer give to the employee forewarning or foreknowledge of the possible or probable consequences of the employee’s disciplinary conduct?\nREASONABLE RULE OR ORDER: Was the Employer’s rules or managerial order reasonably related to (a) the orderly, efficient, and safe operation of the Employer’s business, and (b) the performance that the Employer might properly expect of the employee?\nINVESTIGATION: Did the Employer, before administering the discipline to an employee, make an effort to discover whether the employee did in fact violate or disobey a rule or order of management?\nFAIR INVESTIGATION: Was the Employer’s investigation conducted fairly and objectively?\nPROOF: At the investigation, did the “judge” obtain substantial evidence or proof that the employee was guilty as charged?\nEQUAL TREATMENT: Has the Employer applied its rules, orders and penalties evenhandedly and without discrimination to all employees?\nPENALTY: Was the degree of discipline administered by the Employer in a particular case reasonably related to (a) the seriousness of the employee’s proven offense, and (b) the record of the employee in his service of the Employer?\n\nExclusion of Probationary Employees.\nThe release of probationary employees shall not be subject to the grievance procedure.\nRelated UW-Madison Policies:\nUW-5050 Personal and Legal Holidays\nUW-5054 Paid Parental Leave\nUW-1238 Graduate Assistantships\nRelated UW–Madison Documents, Web Pages, or Other Resources:\nGraduate Assistant Payment of Segregated Fees Policy\nLactation Rooms – Office of Child Care and Family Resources\nExternal References:\nTuition Remission\nHealth insurance rates and information are found: hr.wisc.edu/benefits\nTravel and Reimbursement – Division of Business Services\nSection 7(r) of the Fair Labor Standards Act – Break Time for Nursing Mothers Provision\nOffice of Environment, Health, and Safety.\nOffice of Environmental and Occupational Health\nEqual Opportunity Complaint Investigation\nADA Resources\nCampus Disability Coordinator\nMcBurney Disability Resources Center\nGraduate School appeal process\nPublic Records Law (Wisconsin state statute 19.31-39)\nTo make a Public Records Request send an email through the UW–Madison Public Records service mailbox: public_records@wisc.edu\nTo view additional information about the Public Records Law, go to compliance.wisc.edu and click on the Public Records link\nApproval Authority:\nVice Chancellor for Finance and Administration\nPolicy Manager:\nAssociate Vice Chancellor/Chief Human Resources Officer\nContact:\nEmployment Relations Director -- Megan Dzyuba, wr@ohr.wisc.edu, (608) 890-3663\nRevised Dates:\n01-28-2020, 02-09-2024, 02-14-2025\nRetrieved:\n08-05-2025 11:11:25\n[GRID_TABLE]\nLayout for printing\nPolicy Number:\nUW-5082\nResponsible Office:\nOffice of Human Resources\nLayout for printing\nPolicy Number:\nUW-5082\nResponsible Office:\nOffice of Human Resources\n[GRID_TABLE]\nLayout for printing\nPolicy Number:\nUW-5082\nResponsible Office:\nOffice of Human Resources\n[GRID_TABLE]\nDefinitions:\nDay\nA calendar day, unless otherwise specifically stated.\nYear\nFiscal year (from July 1 through June 30), unless otherwise indicated.\nEmployee\nA graduate student registered at the University, who is currently appointed as a teaching assistant, research assistant or project assistant (including reader/grader).\nUniversity\nThe University of Wisconsin–Madison and University of Wisconsin-Extension.\nDepartment\nAny administrative unit, center or institute which directly employs teaching, project assistants and/or research assistants.\nGraduate Program\nAn academic program which has admitted the student to matriculated graduate study at UW–Madison.\nWork time\nScheduled and Unscheduled work time.\nScheduled work time\nThat portion of work time which is normally scheduled by or at the direction of the University.\nUnscheduled work time\nThat portion of work time which is flexible and normally self-scheduled by the employee.\nProject Assistant (PA)\nThis title designates graduate students enrolled in UW–Madison who are employed to assist with research, training, administrative responsibilities or other academic programs or projects under the supervision of a member or members of the faculty or academic staff, as defined in s. 36.05(1) or (8), Wis.

The academic admitting graduate program may make financial support guarantees to employees for a period longer than one year, and such guarantees may include a variety of appointments, including, but not limited to, teaching, research, and project assistantships. Satisfactory academic progress as defined by the Graduate School and the graduate program handbook is required for reappointment.\nEmployment Criteria\nDepartments or graduate programs that employ Teaching, Project or Research Assistants shall establish criteria for use in making appointments to these titles. These criteria may include but are not limited to such factors as academic record, letters of recommendation, previous relevant experience, and factors related to the academic and research missions of the department.\nCopies of established criteria will be available on request to employees. Departments and graduate programs are strongly encouraged to also make this information available on their websites. It is important to note, the employing department is not necessarily the same as the graduate program.\nLetters of Appointment\nAll newly appointed employees shall receive a letter of appointment from the employing department which specifies the supervisor, appointment title, experience classification (if any), appointment percentage, effective dates, salary or stipend level, length of probationary period (if any), hours of work or work assignment if known, and for eligible employees notification that insurance including health insurance and other benefits may be available and have deadlines for enrollment; the letter will also indicate a person or office to contact for information regarding benefits associated with the appointment. Letters of appointment shall be delivered to the employee before the start of employment.\nIn addition, reappointed employees shall receive a letter of appointment from the employing department which specifies the supervisor, appointment title, experience classification (if any), appointment percentage, effective dates, salary level, and hours of work or work assignment if known.\nProbationary Period\n\nExcept as indicated in B., a TA or PA shall serve a probationary period equivalent to one (1) academic semester in length for an academic semester length appointment or academic year appointment. Two (2) separate two (2) month summer session appointments for TAs will also satisfy the probationary period. All other PA appointments will be for a probationary period of six (6) months. A probationary period is the defined period of time during which the probationary employee may be terminated without recourse to the grievance procedure. The decision to terminate an employee’s appointment during the probationary period requires the approval of the chair/director of the department/unit (or designee). Where the employee is supervised directly by the chair/director, termination of an appointment during the probationary period requires the approval of the dean/director (or designee). An employee must be notified of termination in writing, during the probationary period, either delivered in person or electronically. No employee shall be required to serve more than one (1) probationary period in any one department.For a TA or PA who receives a subsequent appointment involving a change in title or department, the appointing department may require a permissive probationary period of the same duration as described above. The employing department shall make a determination as to whether the appointee shall serve a permissive probationary period and shall notify that employee in the letter of appointment. The employing department may waive these permissive probationary periods at any time. The employee shall be notified by the University of the determination to waive such employee’s probationary period. The University shall include consideration of the employee’s performance in their prior appointment in determining whether or not to waive the probation. This waiver is not subject to the grievance procedure.\nIf an employee’s performance is deemed unsatisfactory during their probation the supervisor and appointing department may extend the employee’s probation to no more than double the original length of the probationary period. If a probation is extended, the employee must be notified in the same manner as probationary termination.\nIn the case of an employee whose performance is deemed unsatisfactory during their probation, the supervisor and appointing department may establish a remedial program. This program may be carried out during the original or extended probationary period, or during a period of non-appointment prior to a renewed appointment. Participation in a remedial program shall not be considered part of the employee’s work duties.\nRAs do not serve probationary periods and should receive, at a minimum, annual feedback regarding their performance from their supervisor, in consultation with the employing department and graduate program. An RA should be notified in writing of where they are not making adequate progress and prepare a remedial plan to correct the deficiencies.\n\nAppointment Percentage for Project and Teaching Assistants\nDuring a semester in an academic year, employees who hold appointments as Teaching Assistants or Project Assistants shall have appointments at a level totaling at least one-third time (33%), except as provided below. Total appointments for employees may be less than one-third time with the agreement of the employee. Such appointments will require approval by the Department and Dean/Director. Employees appointed on a temporary emergency basis and all hourly pay basis Project Assistants may be appointed at a level less than one-third time.\nAppointment Percentage for Research Assistants\nDuring a semester in an academic year, employees who hold appointments as Research Assistants shall have appointments at a level totaling at least one-half time (50%)1 except as provided below. There may be extenuating reasons for RAs to be appointed less than 50%. Such appointments will require approval by the Department and Dean/Director.\nEmployment Information\nThe University will make information about openings and application procedures for Teaching Assistants or Project Assistantships available to ensure that all interested graduate students are given an opportunity to apply. Interested graduate students may follow up their interests at the department level.\nDepartments employing or anticipating the employment of Teaching Assistants or Project Assistants will maintain posted information as follows:\n\nInformation about procedures for applying for Teaching and Project Assistantships including the name or location of an office where inquiries or applications may be made.\nA listing of courses that typically have Teaching Assistants assigned or are expected to have Teaching Assistants assigned. This list will be updated to include special course opportunities that may become available. A separate list of summer sessions course possibilities will be posted if applicable.\nInformation about other Teaching or Project Assistantships that may become available.\n\nEmployment information will be posted electronically in a location designated by the department and easily accessible to graduate students. The University will maintain a web site on which open positions shall be posted. Open positions do not include: positions reserved for guarantees of support and/or recruiting offers; reappointments (continuing positions); and positions that must be filled within seven (7) days for emergency purposes.\nTeaching Assistant Course Assignments\nTeaching Assistants may request assignment to particular courses, and when in the department’s judgment the Teaching Assistant is qualified to teach the course, the course supervisor is agreeable to the assignment, and the department can staff its courses in a manner which it deems satisfactory, the Teaching Assistant’s request shall be granted.\nDepartments shall notify appointed Teaching Assistants of their tentative course assignments, if known, no later than August 1 for fall semester courses and December 1 for spring semester courses. Such notification does not guarantee the assignment.\nTeaching Assistant and Project Assistant Duties\nIn assigning duties to Teaching Assistants or Project Assistants:\nThe department and supervising staff member shall establish the required duties of the employee and the supervising staff member shall discuss these duties with the employee at the beginning of the appointment period.\nIt is understood that Teaching Assistants and Project Assistants are engaged in professional activities of such a nature that the output produced or the result accomplished cannot be precisely measured in relation to a given period of time. In determining the amount of time expected for an employee assignment, consideration shall be given to such factors as type of instruction, number of students instructed, and all other factors, including those specific to the course or group of courses to which instructional duty expectations apply. Fluctuations above and below the hours reflected in the appointment level are expected, corresponding to individual distinctions such as experience. Recognizing that Teaching and Project Assistants are embarked on a program of career and professional development, employees are encouraged to discuss duties with the supervising staff member, at the outset of the appointment and as questions may arise during the appointment.\nIn the case of Teaching Assistants, each department shall provide the employee and their supervisor with an appointment worksheet with the appointment letter at least three (3) days before signed workload sheets are to be returned by the employee, prior to each term of appointment (Fall, Spring and Summer). Copies of these estimates shall be provided to course supervisors.\nIn addition, the employee and their supervisor will have an opportunity to review that worksheet at the commencement of the Teaching Assistant’s employment and throughout the semester. The worksheet shall indicate the approximate distribution of hours to be spent on the various duties required by the appointment and shall include hours for -mandated training time and for any training required by the University and deemed necessary for the performance of the employee’s duties.\nThe function of the aforementioned worksheet is advisory. Neither the specific distribution of hours among tasks on this worksheet, nor deviation from the apportionment of hours shall be construed as binding or grievable.\nDepartments are encouraged to establish workload committees consisting of faculty, staff and graduate students who are current or former Teaching Assistants or Project Assistants to review new and existing workloads for Teaching and Project Assistants annually, identify persistent workload problems and recommend remedies to the department. If a workload committee does not exist, one may be established at the request of a majority of the Departmental Teaching and Project Assistants.\nThe appointment level for Teaching Assistants or Project Assistants shall be based on the department’s determination of the amount of time it should normally take to perform the assigned duties including orientation and training. Satisfactory performance of these duties shall not require an effort exceeding three hundred and sixty (360) hours per semester for a halftime (50%) academic year pay basis appointment; one thousand and forty (1040) hours per year for a halftime (50%) annual pay basis appointment; eight hundred and sixty-seven (867) hours per ten-month period for a halftime (50%) ten-month pay basis appointment; or a proportional number of hours for other durations or percentages of appointment.\nAll Teaching Assistant or Project Assistant duties required by the supervising staff member or the department shall be fairly within the scope of employment and shall be included in the calculation of required hours.\nThe number of hours are stated for the full appointment period, but hours needed to carry out required duties may fluctuate over portions of the appointment period. As soon as the University becomes aware of substantial fluctuations which will occur the employee will be so notified. Except for full time (100%) appointments, if the University knew or should with the exercise of reasonable diligence have known of a substantial increase in the number of hours needed to carry out required duties during a particular period and did not so notify the employee, the employee shall not be required to work more than forty (40) hours in any one week.\nInformal discussion between a supervisor and an employee is likely to be the most effective way to resolve problems in assignment of duties. An employee who finds that the assigned duties appear to require more time than is allocated should immediately notify, and consult with, the supervisor or Department Chair (or designee), who shall reconsider the factors used to determine the amount of time expected. The supervisor and the department may direct either an adjustment in the duties or, pending approval of funding, an adjustment in the appointment level.\nAn employee may submit to the supervisor or Department Chair (or designee) a written request that the duties required be revised. A response shall be made within one (1) week of the written request unless the employee and the department mutually agree to a longer period. If the employee is dissatisfied with the response or no response is forthcoming, the employee may file a grievance. No such grievance will be considered unless there has been a prior written request to make an adjustment.\nA department or supervisor may establish reasonable prerequisites which a Teaching Assistant or Project Assistant must meet in order to hold a particular position and determine whether those prerequisites have been met before the Teaching or Project Assistant becomes eligible to perform those duties. Any prerequisites shall be posted along with the job opening. If a Teaching or Project Assistant requests to hold a position and has not met the prerequisites, the employee shall not be paid for time involved in meeting the prerequisites if the request is granted. If a Teaching or Project Assistant is assigned to a course which the employee has not requested and for which she or he does not meet the prerequisites, the employee shall be paid for the time which is necessary to satisfactorily meet those prerequisites.\nResearch Assistant Activities\nIn assigning activities to RAs, the nature of the work is different than TAs and PAs. RAs are typically not assigned specific duties2. RAs are working toward developing skills in their specific field, and therefore the nature of skills and rate of acquisition of these skills may vary greatly across disciplines and individuals. It is therefore not possible to establish blanket descriptions of duties for RAs that uniformly apply to all in the title.\nThe research assistant and supervising faculty/staff member shall collaboratively develop a research program plan. These research program plans are encouraged to be reviewed by the department chair, program chair, and/or thesis committee.\nIt is understood that RAs are engaged in professional activities of such a nature that the output produced or the result accomplished cannot be precisely measured in relation to a given period of time. Fluctuations above and below the hours reflected in the appointment level are expected. Recognizing that RAs are embarked on a program of educational, career and professional development, employees are encouraged to discuss both a plan of academic study as well as the research program plan with the supervising faculty/staff member, at the outset of the appointment and as questions arise during the appointment3.\nThe employee and their supervisor will have an opportunity to review expectations at the commencement of the RAs employment. The employee and their supervisor shall have periodic meetings to discuss research progress.\nThe function of the aforementioned expectation review is advisory. Neither the specific distribution of hours among tasks, nor deviation from the apportionment of effort shall be construed as binding or grievable.\nInformal discussion between a supervisor and an employee is likely to be the most effective way to resolve problems. Employees are also encouraged to consult their academic program director, handbook and/or thesis committee for additional guidance. An employee who finds that the research plan appears to require more time, involves inappropriate work duties or duties incommensurate with the activities, should consult with the supervisor, who shall reconsider the factors used to determine the expectations. The supervisor and/or the department/unit may adjust the activities.\nFor RA appointments the grievance/appeal procedure regarding the assigned activities is documented by the admitting program’s graduate program handbook. Additional resources may be available based on your employing unit or college. In the event a satisfactory resolution is not achieved, the RA can utilize the Graduate School appeal process.\nWork Surroundings\nThe Department will provide appropriate resources and an adequate and safe work environment necessary for the performance of job responsibilities including access to an office or shared workspace in which to conduct their work. Examples include but are not limited to: access to a printer and copier, access to a computer or laptop, office/instructional supplies, software necessary for instructional tasks / job duties, a departmental mailbox, personal protective equipment, and access to equipment operation manuals, records of equipment safety inspection reports, appropriate lockout/tag out procedures, and hazardous chemical Safety Data Sheets (SDSs). If an employee believes that additional resources or facilities are needed to perform such duties, then they are encouraged to contact their immediate supervisor for the purpose of discussing such needs.\nDepartments are encouraged to consult with a representative group of Teaching or Project Assistants to determine what resources may be necessary for the performance of TA/PA job responsibilities. If the matter is not resolved to the satisfaction of the employee in a reasonable amount of time, then they may bring their concerns directly to the department chair/director.\nThe University will make a good faith effort to provide resources and facilities commensurate with job expectations. Departments will not require employees to pay for resources that the Department has determined are essential for instruction, research or other assigned work.\nThe University of Wisconsin–Madison is committed to creating an accessible and inclusive campus experience for all members of the campus community.\nEmployees seeking information regarding accommodations in their workplace should contact the Campus Disability Coordinator:\n ADA Resources\nCampus Disability Coordinator\nEmployees seeking information regarding accommodations in their studies should contact McBurney Disability Resources Center.\nOrientation and Training\nThe University is responsible for orientation, training, and evaluation of employees. The University recognizes that the professional nature of Teaching, Project and Research Assistants means that these employees have effective contributions to make to their own working performance and environment and that of their colleagues. The parties encourage all schools and colleges, and/or programs, to hold training sessions.\nThe University orients and trains employees regarding appropriate safety and security precautions in a timely manner.\nDepartments and other appointing units are encouraged to review the training and orientation programs available to their Teaching, Project and Research Assistants, and to consult with employees in these groups about ways in which the effectiveness of these programs can be enhanced.\nTeaching and Project Assistant Orientation and Training\nColleges, Schools and Divisions that employ Teaching Assistants or Project Assistants are encouraged to hold training sessions before the fall semester.\nEach department that employs new Teaching Assistants in the fall and spring semesters shall provide training for them, either alone or in combination with other departments. The training shall consist of a minimum of eight (8) required hours designed to aid them in their teaching duties. At least two (2) of these hours of training must come during the semester. The content, design and emphasis of the training shall be determined by the department chair or designee(s). For the fall semester training, a written description of the program shall be available upon request. A Teaching Assistant may be exempted from attending these sessions by the decision of the department chair or designee(s), provided that the Teaching Assistant has previous post-secondary teaching experience. Departments may have more extensive training programs available for certain groups of Teaching Assistants.\nThe University conducts training workshops for Teaching and Project Assistants that will address diversity issues deemed by the University to be relevant to the activities of these employees within their employment with the University. These workshops will be developed in consultation with the campus Office of Equity and Diversity, Teaching Assistants and Project Assistants, and other appropriate offices. These workshops shall not count toward the eight (8) hours of training described above.\nPerformance Evaluation\nTEACHING AND PROJECT ASSISTANT EVALUATIONS\nEach employing unit shall establish an evaluation process to review performance of duties and ability. Employees shall be informed of the evaluation process and criteria for evaluation at the start of the period for which they are being evaluated.\nTeaching Assistant evaluations may include input from the following sources, but should not consist solely of student evaluations:\n\nIndividual student evaluation of the teaching performance of a Teaching Assistant in a course in which the student is enrolled.\nFaculty and staff review of employee performance. If such a review includes an assessment of a Teaching Assistant’s laboratory or classroom performance, the assessment shall include at least one (1) visit by a faculty or staff member. A Teaching Assistant will be given at least twenty-four (24) hours’ notice prior to the initial visit in a semester for this purpose. Prior notice is not required for faculty and/or staff visits for any other purpose, including subsequent visits for evaluation purposes.\nSelf review.\nPeer Review.\n\nPerformance will be reviewed at least once during the term of the appointment. Copies of written performance evaluation reports will be provided to employees. A copy of this report and any written evaluations will be given to the employee who will have the right to make a written response to be placed in their personnel file. Departments are encouraged to provide supervision and evaluation throughout the appointment period.\nIn the event review of Teaching Assistant or Project Assistant teaching performance includes a committee, the committee shall have a faculty majority; its membership may include employee representatives chosen by employees and may include other staff and students.\nIf student evaluations are part of the Teaching or Project Assistant evaluation process, employees will be notified at least forty-eight hours prior to distribution of student evaluation forms. Student evaluations may be part of the Teaching or Project Assistant evaluation process, but shall not be the sole method for evaluating Teaching Assistants.\nRESEARCH ASSISTANT EVALUATIONS\nResearch Assistant performance should be evaluated at least annually. These evaluations should include input from 1 and 2, and may also include, but may not be based solely upon, input from 3,\n\nFaculty/staff supervisor review of employee performance. If such a review includes an assessment of a RAs laboratory performance, the assessment shall include at least one (1) visit by a faculty/staff member.\nThesis Committee Review.\nSelf review and/or Individual Development Plan (IDP) Process.\n\nIf the evaluation process is implemented by a thesis committee, the composition of such committee shall be in accordance with established graduate program and Graduate School procedures.\nComments and data that evidence illegal discrimination shall be excluded from consideration, and the presence of such comments shall be considered in weighing the evaluation as a whole.\nSince RA appointments involve a combined academic and employment experience, there may be a separate academic evaluation made by the supervisor and/or enrolling graduate program. The research assistant and their supervisor should have periodic and ongoing conversations to discuss research progress.\nDiscrimination, Discriminatory Harassment and Retaliation\nThe University of Wisconsin–Madison is committed to providing equal opportunity and equal access and to complying with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations and University of Wisconsin System and university non-discrimination policies and procedures, including Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, which prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability, and the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of age.\nThe University strives to provide a workplace and educational environment free from harassment. Towards that goal, departments shall take affirmative steps to create and maintain workplaces free from harassment.

If an employee voluntarily terminates their employment prior to the original end date of the appointment and has used anticipated vacation time, the employee may be given the option of reimbursing the University by working up to the number of hours taken that were not yet earned. The hours shall be worked before the employee terminates their appointment. If the employee chooses not to work these hours or is involuntarily terminated for cause, an adjustment shall be made in the employee’s final paycheck to reimburse the University for the time that was taken but not yet earned.\nVacation leave shall be used in 15-minute increments for project assistants, and in one-hour increments for research assistants.\nUnused vacation hours will not be paid out at the end of the appointment.\nJURY DUTY\nAn Employee who is absent from assigned duties because of selection for jury duty and who has not been excused by the court in order to meet their obligations, shall be paid their regular salary for the period of time they are required to serve and shall continue to receive full benefits.

Where the appointment period includes two academic semesters, notice must be given within the first two (2) weeks of each semester. When the religious observance falls within the first two (2) weeks of an appointment period (including summer sessions), the Employee should give as much advance notice as possible to their supervisor. Supervisors may set reasonable limits on the total number of days granted for religious observances by any one (1) Employee, subject to Dean/Director approval.\nFLEXIBLE SPENDING ACCOUNT\nThe University offers Employees the opportunity to participate in the Employee-funded Flexible Spending Account program as administered under provisions of Chapter 40. Wis. Stats.\n \n1Based on a 1.0 full-time equivalent (FTE) of 40 hours.\n2As stated in the definition of a Research Assistant, an appointment as a research assistant is appropriate if the activity performed by the research assistant is primarily for the benefit of the individual’s course of study and research and applicable to the individual’s thesis or dissertation. Tasks which are irrelevant to the appointee’s academic program or repetitive beyond that which is necessary to achieve excellence in the activity are not appropriate for an individual appointed as a research assistant.\n3Sometimes research requires long and/or unusual hours to complete a task or to gain mastery of a technique.\n4For example, a Research Assistant appointed to an annual appointment at .50 FTE (or 50%) will earn 90 hours vacation per fiscal year.\nProcedure:\nGRIEVANCE PROCEDURE\nAny Employee who discusses, inquires about, or participates in the grievance procedure may do so openly and shall not be subject to intimidation, discipline, or retaliation because of such activity.\nDefinition and Procedure\nA grievance is defined as, and limited to, a written complaint identifying an alleged violation of a specific employment provision(s) of the Graduate Assistant Policies and Procedures and remedy sought. Grievances may be filed by a Teaching, Project or Research Assistant. Academic-related grievances are pursued through processes described in graduate program handbooks with subsequent appeals following Graduate School policy. An employee who files a grievance is referred to as the grievant. A grievant is encouraged to discuss the complaint with their immediate supervisor as well as other campus resources (e.g. department chair, dean/director, human resources representative, etc.) prior to filing a grievance. The primary purpose of this procedure is to secure equitable solutions to the grievance(s) at the most immediate level possible.\nThe word “days” for the purpose of this article shall be working days and shall not include weekends, university holidays, spring recess or the period from the last day of exams of the fall semester to the first day of the next instructional period, or days in which the grievant is required to leave Madison for extended work-related purposes (e.g. field work or conferences). All time limits may be modified by mutual consent.\nTo the fullest extent possible, a grievance shall contain a clear and concise statement of the grievance and indicate the issue(s) involved, the relief sought, the date(s) the incident or violation took place and the specific policy section or sections involved. The grievance shall be signed and dated by the grievant(s) and representative (if any).\nA grievant shall be notified of the ability to have the assistance of a personal representative. A grievant has the right to find representation of their choosing during the grievance process. The designated representative may change at any time during the process. If representation is chosen and the representative is an attorney, the grievant must alert the University. The grievant cannot be compelled to meet without their representative, however it is the grievant’s responsibility to find representation that can meet within the allotted time frame.\nMeeting with Grievance Representatives.\nA grievant may consult with their representative regarding a grievance, or process a grievance, during working hours for a reasonable period of time, provided that this meeting does not interfere with scheduled work activities.\nGrievances should be presented as soon as reasonably possible, typically no later than sixty (60) days from the date the grievant first became aware of, or should have become aware of with the exercise of reasonable diligence, the cause of such grievance.\nSteps One and Two of the grievance procedure may be waived by mutual agreement.\nThe Grievant and representative (if chosen) shall have the right to file a grievance when any provision of these procedures are alleged to have been violated. Possible relief may include extending the grievance timeframe to ensure that these procedures are followed.\nGrievances may continue after graduation or voluntary separation. In cases of involuntary termination, grievances may be filed by former employees, but must adhere to the relevant timeline(s).\nReceipt of a grievance for purposes of meeting timeline requirements at each step is determined by the date stamp on the grievance form (if hand delivered), digital timestamp (if filed electronically), or envelope postmark (if delivered by U.S. Mail).\nGrievances not answered by the employer within the designated time limits in any step of the grievance procedure may be appealed to the next step within ten (10) days of the expiration of the designated time limits.\nGrievance Steps\nStep One:\nThe grievant must file a written statement with the appointing department/unit chair/director or their designee specifying the grievant’s name, a clear and concise statement of the grievance and the issue(s) involved, the date(s) the incident or violation took place and the specific policy section or sections involved, and the relief sought, The grievance shall be signed and dated by the grievant(s) and representative (if any).\nWithin twenty (20) days of receipt of the written grievance, the department chair/director or designee will meet with the grievant and their representative (if chosen) to hear the grievance and will return a written answer to the grievant and their representative (if chosen) no later than ten (10) days after this meeting. This answer will include a copy of the grievance procedure appeal process timeline, a list of resources and relevant contact information of personnel hearing future steps.\nStep Two:\nIf the decision in Step One is not accepted by the grievant, the grievant shall have 10 days from receipt of the answer in Step One to file an appeal with the appropriate appointing department/unit Dean/Director or designee. The Dean/Director or designee will meet with the grievant and their representative (if chosen) within twenty (20) days from receipt of the appeal of Step One and attempt to resolve the grievance. The Dean/Director or designee will provide the grievant and their representative (if chosen) with a written response to the grievance no later than ten (10) days after this meeting.\nStep Three:\nIf the decision in Step Two is not accepted by the grievant, the grievant shall have 10 days from the receipt of the answer in Step Two to file an appeal with the Office of Human Resources (OHR), specifically the Office of Workforce Relations (OWR). The OHR-OWR office will meet with the grievant and their representative (if chosen) within twenty (20) days from receipt of the appeal of Step Two.\nThe OHR-OWR will provide a written decision to the grievant and their representative (if chosen), no later than ten (10) days after this meeting.\nStep Four:\nGrievances that are not resolved under the foregoing procedure may be appealed to the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission (WERC) by the grievant within twenty (20) days from the date of the answer in Step Three. If an unresolved grievance is not appealed to the WERC within twenty (20) days of the final resolution of Step Three, it shall be considered terminated on the basis of the Third Step answer of the responding party without prejudice or precedent in the resolution of future grievances. The issue as stated on the Third Step grievance and any amendments made thereon, in writing, at the Third Step grievance meeting shall constitute the sole and entire subject matter to be heard by the WERC hearing examiner, unless the parties agree to modify the scope of the hearing. The WERC hearing examiner will be selected by mutual consent of both parties. If the parties have utilized mediation, no reference to mediation shall be admitted as evidence in the hearing.\nWhere two (2) or more grievances are appealed to the WERC by the same individual or regarding a substantially similar matter, an effort will be made by the parties to have the grievances heard by the same hearing examiner.\nThe University will bear the cost of the WERC hearing fees.\nThe hearing examiner shall not have jurisdiction or authority to add to, amend, modify, nullify, or ignore in any way the provisions of University Policy.\nThe decision of the hearing examiner will be forwarded to the Chancellor or Chancellor’s designee for review. The Chancellor or Chancellor’s designee shall release a decision either accepting, rejecting, or modifying the hearing examiner’s decision. The Chancellor’s decision will be final and binding on both parties.\nThe decision of the Chancellor or Chancellor’s designee will be rendered within thirty (30) days from receipt of the WERC’s decision. If no decision is made by the Chancellor or Chancellor’s designee within thirty (30) days, then the decision of the WERC becomes final.\nRetroactivity.\nSettlement of grievances may or may not be retroactive as the equities of particular cases may demand. In any case, the maximum period of retroactivity allowed shall be a date not earlier than sixty (60) days prior to the date of initiation of the written grievance in Step One unless the circumstances of the case made it impossible for the employee to know they had grounds for such claim prior to that date, in which case the retroactivity shall be limited to a period of ninety (90) days prior to the date the grievance was initiated in writing. Employees who voluntarily terminate their employment will have their grievances immediately withdrawn and will not benefit by any later settlement of a group grievance. Graduation shall not be considered voluntary termination for purposes of retroactivity.\nExclusive Procedure.\nThe grievance procedure set out above shall be exclusive and shall replace any other grievance procedure for adjustment of any disputes arising from the application and interpretation of these policies and procedures.\nFurther, in a group grievance, only one (1) grievant shall be the spokesperson for the group. Group grievances must be so designated at each step of the grievance procedure and set forth a list of all employees covered by the grievance. No employees may be added to the list of group grievants after the second step hearing. Relief is restricted to those employees identified by name in the group grievance. Individual grievances which meet the definition of group grievances as contained herein shall be consolidated at each step of the grievance procedure whenever possible. Individual grievances which do not specifically meet the definition of group grievance, contained herein, may be consolidated by mutual agreement.\nDiscipline.\nThe University has the ability to suspend, discharge or take other appropriate disciplinary action against employees for just cause (defined below). If any discipline is taken against an employee, the employee will receive a copy of this disciplinary action. An employee who alleges that such action was without just cause may appeal a suspension or discharge beginning with the second step of the grievance procedure. An employee shall be entitled to the presence of a grievance representative at an investigatory interview if he/she requests one and if the employee has reasonable grounds to believe that the interview may be used to support disciplinary action against him/her. Whenever it is appropriate, the Employer shall give the employee and the grievance representative advance notice of the Employer’s intent to hold an investigatory interview.\nJust Cause\nThe basic elements of just cause have been reduced by arbitrator Carroll R. Daugherty to seven tests outlined below:\n\nNOTICE: Did the Employer give to the employee forewarning or foreknowledge of the possible or probable consequences of the employee’s disciplinary conduct?\nREASONABLE RULE OR ORDER: Was the Employer’s rules or managerial order reasonably related to (a) the orderly, efficient, and safe operation of the Employer’s business, and (b) the performance that the Employer might properly expect of the employee?\nINVESTIGATION: Did the Employer, before administering the discipline to an employee, make an effort to discover whether the employee did in fact violate or disobey a rule or order of management?\nFAIR INVESTIGATION: Was the Employer’s investigation conducted fairly and objectively?\nPROOF: At the investigation, did the “judge” obtain substantial evidence or proof that the employee was guilty as charged?\nEQUAL TREATMENT: Has the Employer applied its rules, orders and penalties evenhandedly and without discrimination to all employees?\nPENALTY: Was the degree of discipline administered by the Employer in a particular case reasonably related to (a) the seriousness of the employee’s proven offense, and (b) the record of the employee in his service of the Employer?\n\nExclusion of Probationary Employees.\nThe release of probationary employees shall not be subject to the grievance procedure.\nRelated UW-Madison Policies:\nUW-5050 Personal and Legal Holidays\nUW-5054 Paid Parental Leave\nUW-1238 Graduate Assistantships\nRelated UW–Madison Documents, Web Pages, or Other Resources:\nGraduate Assistant Payment of Segregated Fees Policy\nLactation Rooms – Office of Child Care and Family Resources\nExternal References:\nTuition Remission\nHealth insurance rates and information are found: hr.wisc.edu/benefits\nTravel and Reimbursement – Division of Business Services\nSection 7(r) of the Fair Labor Standards Act – Break Time for Nursing Mothers Provision\nOffice of Environment, Health, and Safety.\nOffice of Environmental and Occupational Health\nEqual Opportunity Complaint Investigation\nADA Resources\nCampus Disability Coordinator\nMcBurney Disability Resources Center\nGraduate School appeal process\nPublic Records Law (Wisconsin state statute 19.31-39)\nTo make a Public Records Request send an email through the UW–Madison Public Records service mailbox: public_records@wisc.edu\nTo view additional information about the Public Records Law, go to compliance.wisc.edu and click on the Public Records link\n[GRID_TABLE]\nApproval Authority:\nVice Chancellor for Finance and Administration\nPolicy Manager:\nAssociate Vice Chancellor/Chief Human Resources Officer\nContact:\nEmployment Relations Director -- Megan Dzyuba, wr@ohr.wisc.edu, (608) 890-3663\nRevised Dates:\n01-28-2020, 02-09-2024, 02-14-2025\nRetrieved:\n08-05-2025 11:11:25\n[DEFINITION_LIST]\nDefinitions:: Day\nA calendar day, unless otherwise specifically stated.\nYear\nFiscal year (from July 1 through June 30), unless otherwise indicated.\nEmployee\nA graduate student registered at the University, who is currently appointed as a teaching assistant, research assistant or project assistant (including reader/grader).\nUniversity\nThe University of Wisconsin–Madison and University of Wisconsin-Extension.\nDepartment\nAny administrative unit, center or institute which directly employs teaching, project assistants and/or research assistants.\nGraduate Program\nAn academic program which has admitted the student to matriculated graduate study at UW–Madison.\nWork time\nScheduled and Unscheduled work time.\nScheduled work time\nThat portion of work time which is normally scheduled by or at the direction of the University.\nUnscheduled work time\nThat portion of work time which is flexible and normally self-scheduled by the employee.\nProject Assistant (PA)\nThis title designates graduate students enrolled in UW–Madison who are employed to assist with research, training, administrative responsibilities or other academic programs or projects under the supervision of a member or members of the faculty or academic staff, as defined in s. 36.05(1) or (8), Wis.

A probationary period is the defined period of time during which the probationary employee may be terminated without recourse to the grievance procedure. The decision to terminate an employee’s appointment during the probationary period requires the approval of the chair/director of the department/unit (or designee). Where the employee is supervised directly by the chair/director, termination of an appointment during the probationary period requires the approval of the dean/director (or designee). An employee must be notified of termination in writing, during the probationary period, either delivered in person or electronically.

Such notification does not guarantee the assignment.\nTeaching Assistant and Project Assistant Duties\nIn assigning duties to Teaching Assistants or Project Assistants:\nThe department and supervising staff member shall establish the required duties of the employee and the supervising staff member shall discuss these duties with the employee at the beginning of the appointment period.\nIt is understood that Teaching Assistants and Project Assistants are engaged in professional activities of such a nature that the output produced or the result accomplished cannot be precisely measured in relation to a given period of time. In determining the amount of time expected for an employee assignment, consideration shall be given to such factors as type of instruction, number of students instructed, and all other factors, including those specific to the course or group of courses to which instructional duty expectations apply. Fluctuations above and below the hours reflected in the appointment level are expected, corresponding to individual distinctions such as experience. Recognizing that Teaching and Project Assistants are embarked on a program of career and professional development, employees are encouraged to discuss duties with the supervising staff member, at the outset of the appointment and as questions may arise during the appointment.\nIn the case of Teaching Assistants, each department shall provide the employee and their supervisor with an appointment worksheet with the appointment letter at least three (3) days before signed workload sheets are to be returned by the employee, prior to each term of appointment (Fall, Spring and Summer). Copies of these estimates shall be provided to course supervisors.\nIn addition, the employee and their supervisor will have an opportunity to review that worksheet at the commencement of the Teaching Assistant’s employment and throughout the semester. The worksheet shall indicate the approximate distribution of hours to be spent on the various duties required by the appointment and shall include hours for -mandated training time and for any training required by the University and deemed necessary for the performance of the employee’s duties.\nThe function of the aforementioned worksheet is advisory. Neither the specific distribution of hours among tasks on this worksheet, nor deviation from the apportionment of hours shall be construed as binding or grievable.\nDepartments are encouraged to establish workload committees consisting of faculty, staff and graduate students who are current or former Teaching Assistants or Project Assistants to review new and existing workloads for Teaching and Project Assistants annually, identify persistent workload problems and recommend remedies to the department. If a workload committee does not exist, one may be established at the request of a majority of the Departmental Teaching and Project Assistants.\nThe appointment level for Teaching Assistants or Project Assistants shall be based on the department’s determination of the amount of time it should normally take to perform the assigned duties including orientation and training. Satisfactory performance of these duties shall not require an effort exceeding three hundred and sixty (360) hours per semester for a halftime (50%) academic year pay basis appointment; one thousand and forty (1040) hours per year for a halftime (50%) annual pay basis appointment; eight hundred and sixty-seven (867) hours per ten-month period for a halftime (50%) ten-month pay basis appointment; or a proportional number of hours for other durations or percentages of appointment.\nAll Teaching Assistant or Project Assistant duties required by the supervising staff member or the department shall be fairly within the scope of employment and shall be included in the calculation of required hours.\nThe number of hours are stated for the full appointment period, but hours needed to carry out required duties may fluctuate over portions of the appointment period. As soon as the University becomes aware of substantial fluctuations which will occur the employee will be so notified. Except for full time (100%) appointments, if the University knew or should with the exercise of reasonable diligence have known of a substantial increase in the number of hours needed to carry out required duties during a particular period and did not so notify the employee, the employee shall not be required to work more than forty (40) hours in any one week.\nInformal discussion between a supervisor and an employee is likely to be the most effective way to resolve problems in assignment of duties. An employee who finds that the assigned duties appear to require more time than is allocated should immediately notify, and consult with, the supervisor or Department Chair (or designee), who shall reconsider the factors used to determine the amount of time expected. The supervisor and the department may direct either an adjustment in the duties or, pending approval of funding, an adjustment in the appointment level.\nAn employee may submit to the supervisor or Department Chair (or designee) a written request that the duties required be revised. A response shall be made within one (1) week of the written request unless the employee and the department mutually agree to a longer period. If the employee is dissatisfied with the response or no response is forthcoming, the employee may file a grievance. No such grievance will be considered unless there has been a prior written request to make an adjustment.\nA department or supervisor may establish reasonable prerequisites which a Teaching Assistant or Project Assistant must meet in order to hold a particular position and determine whether those prerequisites have been met before the Teaching or Project Assistant becomes eligible to perform those duties. Any prerequisites shall be posted along with the job opening. If a Teaching or Project Assistant requests to hold a position and has not met the prerequisites, the employee shall not be paid for time involved in meeting the prerequisites if the request is granted. If a Teaching or Project Assistant is assigned to a course which the employee has not requested and for which she or he does not meet the prerequisites, the employee shall be paid for the time which is necessary to satisfactorily meet those prerequisites.\nResearch Assistant Activities\nIn assigning activities to RAs, the nature of the work is different than TAs and PAs. RAs are typically not assigned specific duties2. RAs are working toward developing skills in their specific field, and therefore the nature of skills and rate of acquisition of these skills may vary greatly across disciplines and individuals. It is therefore not possible to establish blanket descriptions of duties for RAs that uniformly apply to all in the title.\nThe research assistant and supervising faculty/staff member shall collaboratively develop a research program plan. These research program plans are encouraged to be reviewed by the department chair, program chair, and/or thesis committee.\nIt is understood that RAs are engaged in professional activities of such a nature that the output produced or the result accomplished cannot be precisely measured in relation to a given period of time. Fluctuations above and below the hours reflected in the appointment level are expected. Recognizing that RAs are embarked on a program of educational, career and professional development, employees are encouraged to discuss both a plan of academic study as well as the research program plan with the supervising faculty/staff member, at the outset of the appointment and as questions arise during the appointment3.\nThe employee and their supervisor will have an opportunity to review expectations at the commencement of the RAs employment. The employee and their supervisor shall have periodic meetings to discuss research progress.\nThe function of the aforementioned expectation review is advisory. Neither the specific distribution of hours among tasks, nor deviation from the apportionment of effort shall be construed as binding or grievable.\nInformal discussion between a supervisor and an employee is likely to be the most effective way to resolve problems. Employees are also encouraged to consult their academic program director, handbook and/or thesis committee for additional guidance. An employee who finds that the research plan appears to require more time, involves inappropriate work duties or duties incommensurate with the activities, should consult with the supervisor, who shall reconsider the factors used to determine the expectations. The supervisor and/or the department/unit may adjust the activities.\nFor RA appointments the grievance/appeal procedure regarding the assigned activities is documented by the admitting program’s graduate program handbook. Additional resources may be available based on your employing unit or college. In the event a satisfactory resolution is not achieved, the RA can utilize the Graduate School appeal process.\nWork Surroundings\nThe Department will provide appropriate resources and an adequate and safe work environment necessary for the performance of job responsibilities including access to an office or shared workspace in which to conduct their work. Examples include but are not limited to: access to a printer and copier, access to a computer or laptop, office/instructional supplies, software necessary for instructional tasks / job duties, a departmental mailbox, personal protective equipment, and access to equipment operation manuals, records of equipment safety inspection reports, appropriate lockout/tag out procedures, and hazardous chemical Safety Data Sheets (SDSs). If an employee believes that additional resources or facilities are needed to perform such duties, then they are encouraged to contact their immediate supervisor for the purpose of discussing such needs.\nDepartments are encouraged to consult with a representative group of Teaching or Project Assistants to determine what resources may be necessary for the performance of TA/PA job responsibilities. If the matter is not resolved to the satisfaction of the employee in a reasonable amount of time, then they may bring their concerns directly to the department chair/director.\nThe University will make a good faith effort to provide resources and facilities commensurate with job expectations. Departments will not require employees to pay for resources that the Department has determined are essential for instruction, research or other assigned work.\nThe University of Wisconsin–Madison is committed to creating an accessible and inclusive campus experience for all members of the campus community.\nEmployees seeking information regarding accommodations in their workplace should contact the Campus Disability Coordinator:\n ADA Resources\nCampus Disability Coordinator\nEmployees seeking information regarding accommodations in their studies should contact McBurney Disability Resources Center.\nOrientation and Training\nThe University is responsible for orientation, training, and evaluation of employees. The University recognizes that the professional nature of Teaching, Project and Research Assistants means that these employees have effective contributions to make to their own working performance and environment and that of their colleagues. The parties encourage all schools and colleges, and/or programs, to hold training sessions.\nThe University orients and trains employees regarding appropriate safety and security precautions in a timely manner.\nDepartments and other appointing units are encouraged to review the training and orientation programs available to their Teaching, Project and Research Assistants, and to consult with employees in these groups about ways in which the effectiveness of these programs can be enhanced.\nTeaching and Project Assistant Orientation and Training\nColleges, Schools and Divisions that employ Teaching Assistants or Project Assistants are encouraged to hold training sessions before the fall semester.\nEach department that employs new Teaching Assistants in the fall and spring semesters shall provide training for them, either alone or in combination with other departments. The training shall consist of a minimum of eight (8) required hours designed to aid them in their teaching duties. At least two (2) of these hours of training must come during the semester. The content, design and emphasis of the training shall be determined by the department chair or designee(s). For the fall semester training, a written description of the program shall be available upon request. A Teaching Assistant may be exempted from attending these sessions by the decision of the department chair or designee(s), provided that the Teaching Assistant has previous post-secondary teaching experience. Departments may have more extensive training programs available for certain groups of Teaching Assistants.\nThe University conducts training workshops for Teaching and Project Assistants that will address diversity issues deemed by the University to be relevant to the activities of these employees within their employment with the University. These workshops will be developed in consultation with the campus Office of Equity and Diversity, Teaching Assistants and Project Assistants, and other appropriate offices. These workshops shall not count toward the eight (8) hours of training described above.\nPerformance Evaluation\nTEACHING AND PROJECT ASSISTANT EVALUATIONS\nEach employing unit shall establish an evaluation process to review performance of duties and ability. Employees shall be informed of the evaluation process and criteria for evaluation at the start of the period for which they are being evaluated.\nTeaching Assistant evaluations may include input from the following sources, but should not consist solely of student evaluations:\n\nIndividual student evaluation of the teaching performance of a Teaching Assistant in a course in which the student is enrolled.\nFaculty and staff review of employee performance. If such a review includes an assessment of a Teaching Assistant’s laboratory or classroom performance, the assessment shall include at least one (1) visit by a faculty or staff member. A Teaching Assistant will be given at least twenty-four (24) hours’ notice prior to the initial visit in a semester for this purpose. Prior notice is not required for faculty and/or staff visits for any other purpose, including subsequent visits for evaluation purposes.\nSelf review.\nPeer Review.\n\nPerformance will be reviewed at least once during the term of the appointment. Copies of written performance evaluation reports will be provided to employees. A copy of this report and any written evaluations will be given to the employee who will have the right to make a written response to be placed in their personnel file. Departments are encouraged to provide supervision and evaluation throughout the appointment period.\nIn the event review of Teaching Assistant or Project Assistant teaching performance includes a committee, the committee shall have a faculty majority; its membership may include employee representatives chosen by employees and may include other staff and students.\nIf student evaluations are part of the Teaching or Project Assistant evaluation process, employees will be notified at least forty-eight hours prior to distribution of student evaluation forms. Student evaluations may be part of the Teaching or Project Assistant evaluation process, but shall not be the sole method for evaluating Teaching Assistants.\nRESEARCH ASSISTANT EVALUATIONS\nResearch Assistant performance should be evaluated at least annually. These evaluations should include input from 1 and 2, and may also include, but may not be based solely upon, input from 3,\n\nFaculty/staff supervisor review of employee performance. If such a review includes an assessment of a RAs laboratory performance, the assessment shall include at least one (1) visit by a faculty/staff member.\nThesis Committee Review.\nSelf review and/or Individual Development Plan (IDP) Process.\n\nIf the evaluation process is implemented by a thesis committee, the composition of such committee shall be in accordance with established graduate program and Graduate School procedures.\nComments and data that evidence illegal discrimination shall be excluded from consideration, and the presence of such comments shall be considered in weighing the evaluation as a whole.\nSince RA appointments involve a combined academic and employment experience, there may be a separate academic evaluation made by the supervisor and/or enrolling graduate program. The research assistant and their supervisor should have periodic and ongoing conversations to discuss research progress.\nDiscrimination, Discriminatory Harassment and Retaliation\nThe University of Wisconsin–Madison is committed to providing equal opportunity and equal access and to complying with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations and University of Wisconsin System and university non-discrimination policies and procedures, including Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, which prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability, and the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of age.\nThe University strives to provide a workplace and educational environment free from harassment.

Tasks which are irrelevant to the appointee’s academic program or repetitive beyond that which is necessary to achieve excellence in the activity are not appropriate for an individual appointed as a research assistant.\n3Sometimes research requires long and/or unusual hours to complete a task or to gain mastery of a technique.\n4For example, a Research Assistant appointed to an annual appointment at .50 FTE (or 50%) will earn 90 hours vacation per fiscal year.\nProcedure:: GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE\nAny Employee who discusses, inquires about, or participates in the grievance procedure may do so openly and shall not be subject to intimidation, discipline, or retaliation because of such activity.\nDefinition and Procedure\nA grievance is defined as, and limited to, a written complaint identifying an alleged violation of a specific employment provision(s) of the Graduate Assistant Policies and Procedures and remedy sought. Grievances may be filed by a Teaching, Project or Research Assistant. Academic-related grievances are pursued through processes described in graduate program handbooks with subsequent appeals following Graduate School policy. An employee who files a grievance is referred to as the grievant. A grievant is encouraged to discuss the complaint with their immediate supervisor as well as other campus resources (e.g. department chair, dean/director, human resources representative, etc.) prior to filing a grievance. The primary purpose of this procedure is to secure equitable solutions to the grievance(s) at the most immediate level possible.\nThe word “days” for the purpose of this article shall be working days and shall not include weekends, university holidays, spring recess or the period from the last day of exams of the fall semester to the first day of the next instructional period, or days in which the grievant is required to leave Madison for extended work-related purposes (e.g. field work or conferences). All time limits may be modified by mutual consent.\nTo the fullest extent possible, a grievance shall contain a clear and concise statement of the grievance and indicate the issue(s) involved, the relief sought, the date(s) the incident or violation took place and the specific policy section or sections involved. The grievance shall be signed and dated by the grievant(s) and representative (if any).\nA grievant shall be notified of the ability to have the assistance of a personal representative. A grievant has the right to find representation of their choosing during the grievance process. The designated representative may change at any time during the process. If representation is chosen and the representative is an attorney, the grievant must alert the University. The grievant cannot be compelled to meet without their representative, however it is the grievant’s responsibility to find representation that can meet within the allotted time frame.\nMeeting with Grievance Representatives.\nA grievant may consult with their representative regarding a grievance, or process a grievance, during working hours for a reasonable period of time, provided that this meeting does not interfere with scheduled work activities.\nGrievances should be presented as soon as reasonably possible, typically no later than sixty (60) days from the date the grievant first became aware of, or should have become aware of with the exercise of reasonable diligence, the cause of such grievance.\nSteps One and Two of the grievance procedure may be waived by mutual agreement.\nThe Grievant and representative (if chosen) shall have the right to file a grievance when any provision of these procedures are alleged to have been violated. Possible relief may include extending the grievance timeframe to ensure that these procedures are followed.\nGrievances may continue after graduation or voluntary separation. In cases of involuntary termination, grievances may be filed by former employees, but must adhere to the relevant timeline(s).\nReceipt of a grievance for purposes of meeting timeline requirements at each step is determined by the date stamp on the grievance form (if hand delivered), digital timestamp (if filed electronically), or envelope postmark (if delivered by U.S. Mail).\nGrievances not answered by the employer within the designated time limits in any step of the grievance procedure may be appealed to the next step within ten (10) days of the expiration of the designated time limits.\nGrievance Steps\nStep One:\nThe grievant must file a written statement with the appointing department/unit chair/director or their designee specifying the grievant’s name, a clear and concise statement of the grievance and the issue(s) involved, the date(s) the incident or violation took place and the specific policy section or sections involved, and the relief sought, The grievance shall be signed and dated by the grievant(s) and representative (if any).\nWithin twenty (20) days of receipt of the written grievance, the department chair/director or designee will meet with the grievant and their representative (if chosen) to hear the grievance and will return a written answer to the grievant and their representative (if chosen) no later than ten (10) days after this meeting. This answer will include a copy of the grievance procedure appeal process timeline, a list of resources and relevant contact information of personnel hearing future steps.\nStep Two:\nIf the decision in Step One is not accepted by the grievant, the grievant shall have 10 days from receipt of the answer in Step One to file an appeal with the appropriate appointing department/unit Dean/Director or designee. The Dean/Director or designee will meet with the grievant and their representative (if chosen) within twenty (20) days from receipt of the appeal of Step One and attempt to resolve the grievance. The Dean/Director or designee will provide the grievant and their representative (if chosen) with a written response to the grievance no later than ten (10) days after this meeting.\nStep Three:\nIf the decision in Step Two is not accepted by the grievant, the grievant shall have 10 days from the receipt of the answer in Step Two to file an appeal with the Office of Human Resources (OHR), specifically the Office of Workforce Relations (OWR). The OHR-OWR office will meet with the grievant and their representative (if chosen) within twenty (20) days from receipt of the appeal of Step Two.\nThe OHR-OWR will provide a written decision to the grievant and their representative (if chosen), no later than ten (10) days after this meeting.\nStep Four:\nGrievances that are not resolved under the foregoing procedure may be appealed to the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission (WERC) by the grievant within twenty (20) days from the date of the answer in Step Three. If an unresolved grievance is not appealed to the WERC within twenty (20) days of the final resolution of Step Three, it shall be considered terminated on the basis of the Third Step answer of the responding party without prejudice or precedent in the resolution of future grievances. The issue as stated on the Third Step grievance and any amendments made thereon, in writing, at the Third Step grievance meeting shall constitute the sole and entire subject matter to be heard by the WERC hearing examiner, unless the parties agree to modify the scope of the hearing. The WERC hearing examiner will be selected by mutual consent of both parties. If the parties have utilized mediation, no reference to mediation shall be admitted as evidence in the hearing.\nWhere two (2) or more grievances are appealed to the WERC by the same individual or regarding a substantially similar matter, an effort will be made by the parties to have the grievances heard by the same hearing examiner.\nThe University will bear the cost of the WERC hearing fees.\nThe hearing examiner shall not have jurisdiction or authority to add to, amend, modify, nullify, or ignore in any way the provisions of University Policy.\nThe decision of the hearing examiner will be forwarded to the Chancellor or Chancellor’s designee for review. The Chancellor or Chancellor’s designee shall release a decision either accepting, rejecting, or modifying the hearing examiner’s decision. The Chancellor’s decision will be final and binding on both parties.\nThe decision of the Chancellor or Chancellor’s designee will be rendered within thirty (30) days from receipt of the WERC’s decision. If no decision is made by the Chancellor or Chancellor’s designee within thirty (30) days, then the decision of the WERC becomes final.\nRetroactivity.\nSettlement of grievances may or may not be retroactive as the equities of particular cases may demand. In any case, the maximum period of retroactivity allowed shall be a date not earlier than sixty (60) days prior to the date of initiation of the written grievance in Step One unless the circumstances of the case made it impossible for the employee to know they had grounds for such claim prior to that date, in which case the retroactivity shall be limited to a period of ninety (90) days prior to the date the grievance was initiated in writing. Employees who voluntarily terminate their employment will have their grievances immediately withdrawn and will not benefit by any later settlement of a group grievance. Graduation shall not be considered voluntary termination for purposes of retroactivity.\nExclusive Procedure.\nThe grievance procedure set out above shall be exclusive and shall replace any other grievance procedure for adjustment of any disputes arising from the application and interpretation of these policies and procedures.\nFurther, in a group grievance, only one (1) grievant shall be the spokesperson for the group. Group grievances must be so designated at each step of the grievance procedure and set forth a list of all employees covered by the grievance. No employees may be added to the list of group grievants after the second step hearing. Relief is restricted to those employees identified by name in the group grievance. Individual grievances which meet the definition of group grievances as contained herein shall be consolidated at each step of the grievance procedure whenever possible. Individual grievances which do not specifically meet the definition of group grievance, contained herein, may be consolidated by mutual agreement.\nDiscipline.\nThe University has the ability to suspend, discharge or take other appropriate disciplinary action against employees for just cause (defined below). If any discipline is taken against an employee, the employee will receive a copy of this disciplinary action. An employee who alleges that such action was without just cause may appeal a suspension or discharge beginning with the second step of the grievance procedure. An employee shall be entitled to the presence of a grievance representative at an investigatory interview if he/she requests one and if the employee has reasonable grounds to believe that the interview may be used to support disciplinary action against him/her. Whenever it is appropriate, the Employer shall give the employee and the grievance representative advance notice of the Employer’s intent to hold an investigatory interview.\nJust Cause\nThe basic elements of just cause have been reduced by arbitrator Carroll R. Daugherty to seven tests outlined below:\n\nNOTICE: Did the Employer give to the employee forewarning or foreknowledge of the possible or probable consequences of the employee’s disciplinary conduct?\nREASONABLE RULE OR ORDER: Was the Employer’s rules or managerial order reasonably related to (a) the orderly, efficient, and safe operation of the Employer’s business, and (b) the performance that the Employer might properly expect of the employee?\nINVESTIGATION: Did the Employer, before administering the discipline to an employee, make an effort to discover whether the employee did in fact violate or disobey a rule or order of management?\nFAIR INVESTIGATION: Was the Employer’s investigation conducted fairly and objectively?\nPROOF: At the investigation, did the “judge” obtain substantial evidence or proof that the employee was guilty as charged?\nEQUAL TREATMENT: Has the Employer applied its rules, orders and penalties evenhandedly and without discrimination to all employees?\nPENALTY: Was the degree of discipline administered by the Employer in a particular case reasonably related to (a) the seriousness of the employee’s proven offense, and (b) the record of the employee in his service of the Employer?\n\nExclusion of Probationary Employees.\nThe release of probationary employees shall not be subject to the grievance procedure.\nRelated UW-Madison Policies:: UW-5050 Personal and Legal Holidays\nUW-5054 Paid Parental Leave\nUW-1238 Graduate Assistantships\nRelated UW–Madison Documents, Web Pages, or Other Resources:: Graduate Assistant Payment of Segregated Fees Policy\nLactation Rooms – Office of Child Care and Family Resources\nExternal References:: Tuition Remission\nHealth insurance rates and information are found: hr.wisc.edu/benefits\nTravel and Reimbursement – Division of Business Services\nSection 7(r) of the Fair Labor Standards Act – Break Time for Nursing Mothers Provision\nOffice of Environment, Health, and Safety.\nOffice of Environmental and Occupational Health\nEqual Opportunity Complaint Investigation\nADA Resources\nCampus Disability Coordinator\nMcBurney Disability Resources Center\nGraduate School appeal process\nPublic Records Law (Wisconsin state statute 19.31-39)\nTo make a Public Records Request send an email through the UW–Madison Public Records service mailbox: public_records@wisc.edu\nTo view additional information about the Public Records Law, go to compliance.wisc.edu and click on the Public Records link\n[DEFINITION_LIST]\nDay: A calendar day, unless otherwise specifically stated.\nYear: Fiscal year (from July 1 through June 30), unless otherwise indicated.\nEmployee: A graduate student registered at the University, who is currently appointed as a teaching assistant, research assistant or project assistant (including reader/grader).\nUniversity: The University of Wisconsin–Madison and University of Wisconsin-Extension.\nDepartment: Any administrative unit, center or institute which directly employs teaching, project assistants and/or research assistants.\nGraduate Program: An academic program which has admitted the student to matriculated graduate study at UW–Madison.\nWork time: Scheduled and Unscheduled work time.\nScheduled work time: That portion of work time which is normally scheduled by or at the direction of the University.\nUnscheduled work time: That portion of work time which is flexible and normally self-scheduled by the employee.\nProject Assistant (PA): This title designates graduate students enrolled in UW–Madison who are employed to assist with research, training, administrative responsibilities or other academic programs or projects under the supervision of a member or members of the faculty or academic staff, as defined in s. 36.05(1) or (8), Wis.

Programs use their own internal processes to award assistantships to students.\nFellowships are grants that you do not have to pay back. Unlike graduate assistantships, fellowships generally involve no work obligations. There are both campus/departmental and external fellowships.\nTraineeships are supported by federal training grants from agencies like the NIH and NSF. Benefits typically include tuition/fee remission, stipend, and health insurance. To inquire about traineeships, check with your graduate program coordinator.\nThe Office of Student Financial Aid provides information and assistance to prospective, new, and enrolled graduate students about federal work study and student loans.\nThe UW–Madison Student Jobs Center has listings of open positions both on campus and off campus in Madison and the surrounding areas. Keep in mind that only 33% and higher graduate assistantships provide tuition remission for eligible students.*\nThis Graduate School competition includes awards for international and domestic travel for eligible UW–Madison graduate students who are traveling to present at a conference or conduct research supporting their dissertation, thesis, or final project.\n*Graduate students enrolled in service-based pricing programs, such as online and accelerated programs, are ineligible to receive tuition remission. Students should consult with their graduate programs and read their admission and appointment letters carefully to understand their benefits eligibility.\nU.S. citizenship is a requirement for some fellowships, but there are others for which international students are eligible, including University Fellowships and some departmental fellowships. Adequate financial resources are required for applicants.\nCost of attendance (COA) is an estimate of what it will cost to cover the expenses of attending UW–Madison. Your COA is more than just tuition and fees – it includes cost of housing, books, supplies, health insurance, and other living expenses. Although the actual cost of attending UW–Madison varies depending on your particular spending habits, the university bases your financial aid award on your COA.  Visit the Office of Student Financial Aid website to learn more.\nMost UW–Madison students are assessed segregated fees in addition to tuition. These fees fund the bus pass program, University Health Services, the Child Care Tuition Assistance Program, and other services, which are used at significant rates by graduate students.\nStudents with tuition remission are required to pay segregated fees. Fellowships paid through the Graduate School (not including Vilas travel awards) cover segregated fees in addition to tuition.\nSegregated fees are funds dedicated to supporting various student service programs and organizations. The student government on campus is responsible for the allocation of these funds. The Student Services Finance Committee (SSFC) of the Associated Students of Madison (ASM) submits budget recommendations to the ASM Student Council and the Chancellor as to how student fees should be spent.\nGraduate students with assistantship appointments of 33.3% or higher receive multiple benefits including a monthly stipend, remission* of both resident and non-resident tuition, and eligibility for health insurance with appointments of at least a full semester (for academic year positions) or six months (for annual positions). Students also build professional competency through assistantship experiences.\n*Graduate students enrolled in service-based pricing programs, such as online and accelerated programs, are ineligible to receive tuition remission. Students should consult with their graduate programs and read their admission and appointment letters carefully to understand their benefits eligibility. See a list of UW–Madison programs with service-based pricing (NetID login required).\nUW–Madison invests millions in support for graduate assistantships, including teaching assistantships, project assistantships, research assistantships, and lecturer student assistant appointments. Recent increases have placed UW–Madison’s minimum stipend levels for graduate assistants at or above the peer institution median.\nAt UW–Madison, admissions and funding decisions are made by the specific graduate program(s) to which you apply rather than by a centralized cross-campus process.  Because of the diversity of graduate programs available on campus, graduate programs differ in how they make admissions and funding decisions.  For example, some graduate programs only admit students if they can support them financially with assistantships, traineeships, or fellowships, while other graduate programs admit students without a funding offer.\nGraduate programs at UW–Madison also differ in the timing of their admissions and funding decisions.  Some graduate programs make admissions and funding decisions at the same time while other programs make admissions decisions first and funding decisions later.  As a result, you should always start your search for information about funding by contacting your intended program(s).  Program staff will be able to tell you how, when, and to what level funding is typically awarded to incoming students.  Likewise, if you have been admitted to a program, but have not received an offer of funding, you should contact the program to inquire about the timing of their funding decisions.\nYou may receive a funding offer from your graduate program.  A funding package is an offer of financial support put together by your program for a specified number of years.  A funding package may include a combination of different types of appointments (e.g.,  TA positions, program assistantships, or fellowships).\nThe terms and conditions of those appointments, including your stipend, may vary from year to year or from term to term. In addition, students enrolled in service-based pricing programs, such as online and accelerated programs, are ineligible for tuition remission.\nRemember that fellowships do not require you to work, but graduate assistantship and student hourly appointments do.  Therefore, it is very important that you take the time to understand the funding package you are offered.  The funding letter sent to you by the program should outline all the components of the package being offered.  For each appointment, you should ask for the following information:\nIf you have any questions about your funding package or about the information in your funding letter, contact your graduate program.\nFor questions related to how a graduate assistantship or fellowship appointment affects your financial aid offer, contact the Office of Student Financial Aid.\nPayroll taxes are assessed in identical circumstances for stipends provided to research assistants (RAs), project assistants (PAs), and teaching assistants (TAs) — i.e., income taxes are withheld, but FICA tax is not as long as the student is enrolled in at least a half time course of study. Trainee and fellow stipends are also taxable; however, tuition, fees, and books may be deducted before students calculate their tax liability. Find more information on the Office of Human Resources’ Pay webpage.\nFICA tax funds social security and Medicare programs. To be eligible for FICA exemption, non-dissertator graduate students must be enrolled at UW–Madison at least half time (4 credits during the spring and fall semesters), or 3 credits for dissertators.

Your COA is more than just tuition and fees – it includes cost of housing, books, supplies, health insurance, and other living expenses. Although the actual cost of attending UW–Madison varies depending on your particular spending habits, the university bases your financial aid award on your COA.  Visit the Office of Student Financial Aid website to learn more.\n\n\n\n\n\nSegregated fees\n\nMost UW–Madison students are assessed segregated fees in addition to tuition. These fees fund the bus pass program, University Health Services, the Child Care Tuition Assistance Program, and other services, which are used at significant rates by graduate students.\nStudents with tuition remission are required to pay segregated fees. Fellowships paid through the Graduate School (not including Vilas travel awards) cover segregated fees in addition to tuition.\n\n\n\n\n\nSegregated fee allocation\n\nSegregated fees are funds dedicated to supporting various student service programs and organizations. The student government on campus is responsible for the allocation of these funds. The Student Services Finance Committee (SSFC) of the Associated Students of Madison (ASM) submits budget recommendations to the ASM Student Council and the Chancellor as to how student fees should be spent.\nStipend rates and benefits\n\nGraduate students with assistantship appointments of 33.3% or higher receive multiple benefits including a monthly stipend, remission* of both resident and non-resident tuition, and eligibility for health insurance with appointments of at least a full semester (for academic year positions) or six months (for annual positions). Students also build professional competency through assistantship experiences.\n*Graduate students enrolled in service-based pricing programs, such as online and accelerated programs, are ineligible to receive tuition remission. Students should consult with their graduate programs and read their admission and appointment letters carefully to understand their benefits eligibility. See a list of UW–Madison programs with service-based pricing (NetID login required).\n\n\n\n\n\nInvesting in graduate assistantships\n\nUW–Madison invests millions in support for graduate assistantships, including teaching assistantships, project assistantships, research assistantships, and lecturer student assistant appointments. Recent increases have placed UW–Madison’s minimum stipend levels for graduate assistants at or above the peer institution median.\n[CARD]\nTypes of Funding\n\n\n\nGraduate assistantshipsThere are three types of graduate assistantships on campus: teaching, project, and research assistantships.

Many graduate programs at UW–Madison are consistently ranked among the top in their fields.  However, one size does not fit all; so be sure to select a program and institution that you are confident is the right choice for you. Below are some questions to help you make this important decision.\nBecause of your special interests, such as:\nBecause with a PhD you can:\nAsk yourself these questions:\nPhD, or Doctor of Philosophy: Some programs admit directly. Others require students earn the master’s degree first, on their way to earning the PhD.\nMaster’s degree: Some programs require a thesis, some do not, and some give students the option to choose which track they’d like to pursue.\nProfessional degrees: Doctor of Medicine (MD), Juris Doctor (JD), Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP), Doctor of Audiology (AudD), etc.\nProfessional/Terminal Masters: Master of Fine Arts (MFA), Master of Business Administration (MBA), Master of Public Health (MPH), etc.\nFind 8-10 schools that fit your research interests and goals.  University websites are often the best places to start your research.  Ask your undergraduate faculty where they studied or where they would recommend you look.\nWhen you attend conferences and/or participate in professional organizations, inquire about which universities your colleagues attended.  Research the faculty research or scholarly interests at schools you are considering.  Talk to current graduate students at your selected schools.  What has their experience been like?\nAsk about support programs such as scholarly communities, tutoring centers, writing center, library workshops, professional development opportunities, career services, technology training, etc.\nAsk about funding.  Graduate school differs from undergraduate study, because as a graduate student you may be able to find funding sources to support you, such as fellowships or assistantships, without having to take out student loans.\nThis is an accordion element with a series of buttons that open and close related content panels.\nThinking about attending? Check out the benefits of a graduate assistantship at UW–Madison.\nVisit the graduate program website for information about faculty and their research, courses offered, graduate student profiles, and student support and professional development activities. This will help you get a sense of the culture and priorities of the program, what they may be looking for in a potential student, and if it is a good fit for you – for example, your research interests, professional development needs and career goals. You can then address these topics in your Statement of Purpose. If you have any questions, contact the graduate program.\nBe specific about your interest and knowledge particular to this program: Have you read an article by one or more faculty member? Has your advisor specifically directed you to this program? Do you have other ties to this program and/or school? Pick out the pertinent facts about your academic and professional interests that make you a good fit with the program and institution to which you are applying. (A statement of purpose is not a place to list everything you have done.) Mention extra-curricular achievements to illustrate additional dimensions of your personality. Demonstrate curiosity, creativity, enthusiasm for learning, a capacity for teamwork, ability to think independently, and pride in your work. Using brief anecdotes is a good way to make your points. Explain (briefly) any incongruity in your application material, such as a low semester grade. Stay within the page limit specified by the graduate program. If there are no specifications, limit yourself to two pages. Be succinct and clear.\nLet at least two people read your statement, preferably a faculty member and an academic advisor, and ask them to provide feedback. Revise accordingly; you want to submit a well-balanced statement that helps you make a strong case for your candidacy. Proofread, proofread, proofread to ensure there are no grammatical or spelling errors. Do not depend on your word processor to do this for you.\nReady to apply to UW–Madison?

Start out by learning the admissions process and deadlines, faculty research interests, required and recommended curriculum, the funding landscape, and what the experience of other students in the program has been like. In particular, exploring faculty research interests is key to deciding for yourself if UW–Madison is the right university for you, and it is important as you articulate to the program’s admissions committee why you are a good fit.\nEach graduate program has its own deadlines, admission committee, and recommendation process; direct any questions to the contact person listed on the program-specific information page.\nAlthough the Graduate School sets minimum requirements, other application requirements vary by program. Check out the links below to find out more about what you will need to apply.\nYou can apply for up to 3 programs within the same entry term. The application fee is $75, plus an additional $6 processing fee for international applicants. Your materials will first be reviewed by your program, then by the Graduate School.\nTo review the status of your submitted application, log in to your Application Portal. Any requests for information or changes in your status will be noted in the portal.\nRecommendations are made by programs, and the Graduate School makes final admission decisions. Decisions can be viewed in the Application Portal, where applicants accept or decline admission.\nOnce you are admitted, you commit to begin your graduate program in the term for which you applied. UW–Madison considers requests to change your start term on a case by case basis.\nTerm changes are considered for extraordinary circumstances outside a student’s control. Examples include:\nTerm change requests are not granted for voluntary or preference based reasons, such as taking a gap year or starting a full time job.\nYou must request a term change before the term for which you were originally admitted begins. Term changes can be requested for adjacent semesters only.* Contact your graduate program for more information.\nFor summer 2025 and fall 2025 entry terms only, the Graduate School will consider term changes of up to one year from a student’s original admit term.\nFor help with your application, first look through these frequently asked questions. If you have other questions or encounter any problems with your application, contact admissions at admissions@grad.wisc.edu.\nThis is an accordion element with a series of buttons that open and close related content panels.\nThe application fee is $75 U.S. It is non-refundable and can be paid by credit card (MasterCard or Visa), Debit/ATM. In addition, non-U.S. citizens will be charged a $6 international document processing fee.\nApplication deadlines vary from program to program. Before starting your application, it is very important to check the deadlines on your academic program’s page.\nThe application fee is non-refundable. Before submitting an application, we encourage all applicants to make sure you have:\nSubmitted application materials cannot be updated or changed. If you wish to add application materials after submission, you must contact your program to see if their review timeline and policies allow applicants to provide new documentation. Any new documentation accepted by the program will be added to your application, and will not replace existing documentation. You can find contact information for your program on your academic program’s Graduate Guide page.\nYou can update your recommendations after submission by following the directions below:\nOnce you have submitted your application, you cannot change your term. You will need to submit a new application for the same program for the correct term which will require creating a new application and paying an additional application fee.\nYou can apply for up to 3 programs within the same entry term (spring term, summer term, or fall term) for one application fee. You will pay the application fee for the first submitted application. The fee will automatically be waived for the next two applications submitted for the same entry term.\nPlease note that submitted recommendations do not carry over from one application to the next. If applying to multiple programs that require recommendations, your recommender(s) will need to upload a new recommendation for each application you submit.\nWhen you apply, you will be asked to upload copies of your transcripts. The copies of your transcripts uploaded into the application are used for review purposes only and are considered unofficial transcripts.\nIf you are recommended for admission by your program, the Graduate School will email you directions on how to provide official transcripts to the Graduate School Office of Admissions for final review and processing.\nAll transcripts become property of the UW–Madison Graduate School and will not be returned to you.\nAfter you have applied, you can check which official transcripts have been received by the UW-Madison Graduate School Office of Admissions by following the directions below:\nPlease note that University of Wisconsin-Madison students applying to the Graduate School do not need to send an official University of Wisconsin-Madison transcript.

Note some policies redirect to entries in the official UW–Madison Policy Library.\nThe Graduate School Office of Academic Services is the Academic Dean’s Office for all graduate students. Forms requiring the dean’s signature should be submitted to gsacserv@grad.wisc.edu (for example, course change form, audit form, credit overload request form). This office also monitors satisfactory progress toward degree completion.\nIn situations where policies have changed during a student’s time of enrollment, the Graduate School and the academic program, together with the student, may elect to enforce requirements that are in the best interest of the student. Please contact Academic Services with any questions regarding Graduate School procedures and policies. The Academic Policies and Procedures Glossary reflects current policies and procedures of the Graduate School, the Office of the Registrar, the Office of the Bursar, the International Students Services (ISS), and other university units.\nStudents who hold Graduate Assistant positions (TA, PA, and RA) can refer to Graduate Assistant Policies and Procedures (GAPP), available from the Office of Human Resources, for employment-related policies and practices.\nThis is an accordion element with a series of buttons that open and close related content panels.\nDiversity is a source of strength, creativity, and innovation for UW–Madison. We value the contributions of each person and respect the profound ways their identity, culture, background, experience, status, abilities, and opinion enrich the university community. We commit ourselves to the pursuit of excellence in teaching, research, outreach, and diversity as inextricably linked goals.\nThe University of Wisconsin–Madison fulfills its public mission by creating a welcoming and inclusive community for people from every background—people who as students, faculty, and staff serve Wisconsin and the world.\nInquiries concerning this policy may be directed to the appropriate campus admitting or employing unit, to the Division of Diversity, Equity & Educational Achievement.\nCategory Filter:\nIt is a student’s responsibility to be aware of the add/drop deadlines each term. Consult the Office of the Registrar’s website for essential enrollment information and important deadlines. Courses may be added, dropped, or swapped through MyUW Student Center before and during the first two weeks of a semester (or the first week in the general 8-week summer session).\nIf a student drops a course, swaps out of a course, decreases credits in a variable credit course (via the “edit” function), or withdraws from the university, tuition and fee refunds are dispensed following a strict refund schedule. Modular courses and summer session courses have a shorter refund period.\nInternational students are not allowed to drop below full-time enrollment unless they have first received authorization from International Student Services (ISS). This will ensure that they remain in compliance with Department of Homeland Security (DHS) visa regulations. International students holding graduate assistantships, fellowships, and traineeships must meet minimum enrollment requirements. A reduced course load from ISS does not exempt graduate students holding assistantships, fellowships, and traineeships from these minimum enrollment requirements.\nIf students enroll for a course and do not attend, they must drop the class or receive a grade of NW (No Work) or, for audited classes, NR (No Report). If students make a course change after the fee refund deadlines (including audited, modular, and zero-credit courses), they may be charged a fee even if the total number of credits for which they are enrolled does not change. The Bursar’s Office will notify students if they owe additional fees or are entitled to a refund.\nStudents should be aware that “swap” is a drop action combined with an add action, allowing them to swap from one section to another section within the same course, or swap one course for another course. Some cautions related to swapping courses:\nFor more information and questions, contact the Office of the Registrar or Graduate School Office of Academic Services. Demos & Tutorials for course enrollment are available through the Office of the Registrar. For instructions on how to late add/change/drop a class, visit the Late Enrollment/Late Course Change/Late Drop section.\nSee Authorization for Courses, Course Changes, Credit Changes, Dean’s Approval, Enrollment Requirements, Exceptions, Late Enrollment/Late Course Change/Late Drop, Tuition and Fee Information, Withdrawal\nAn advisor is a faculty member from the program responsible for providing advice regarding graduate studies and for supervising a student’s degree program (including research). An advisor—sometimes referred to as the major professor, mentor, or trainer—generally serves as chair of a student’s final examination committee.\nThe advisor/student relationship is one of mutual agreement, which may be terminated by either party. If a student changes advisors, they need to notify their program coordinator. It is the responsibility of every graduate student to have an advisor. If students do not have an advisor, the Graduate School may suspend them from further graduate study at UW–Madison until they find an advisor. However, in some cases, particularly for incoming students, the program may assign an advisor.\nWith approval from the program, students can have a co-advisor/co-chair. The co-advisor/co-chair may be from any of the following categories: graduate faculty, faculty from a department without a graduate program, academic staff (including emeritus faculty), visiting faculty, faculty from another institution, scientists, research associates, and other individuals deemed qualified by the program executive committee or its equivalent. Effective September 1, 2017, the co-advisor/co-chair will be designated on dissertation documentation.\nSee Committees (Doctoral/Master’s)\nCurrently enrolled graduate students who want to apply to add, change, or discontinue a program of study, or add a certificate, do so through the Graduate Student Portal (in the MyGradPortal in MyUW).  An admissions application and fee are not required.\nStudents must check with the intended program concerning admission requirements (for example, letters of recommendation or statement of purpose) and eligibility. Upon receipt of a recommendation from the program, the Graduate School will notify the student of the decision. Note: Changing programs between a service based pricing program and a pooled program during a term are not allowed, so students should always indicate the next academic term when requesting to change between these types of programs. Adding minors, certificates, or discontinuing a program is allowed during a term. Questions regarding the status of an application are best directed to the program.\nIf dissertators want to add a program, typically a master’s program or a certificate program, they cannot concurrently hold dissertator fee status while pursuing the graduate degree or certificate. Dissertators who add a program or a certificate program will be removed from dissertator status and must enroll and pay fees as a regular graduate student.\nInternational students who add/change a program or a certificate program should contact International Student Services to discuss the possible effects this change of program could have on immigration status.\nAccess MyUW and the Graduate Student Portal:\nInitiating a request:\nThe request will show up as “In Review” in the Requests section on the Add/Change Programs page. Your Graduate Program Coordinator will follow up once your request is decided. More detailed instructions on this process, including example screenshots, can be found in the Add/Change/Discontinue Program Training.\nSee Change of Degree Level (Plan), Change of Degree Named Option, Dissertator Status, Named Option, Programs (or ‘Majors’)\nDepartments/programs determine eligibility for most Teaching Assistantships (TAs), Research Assistantships (RAs), and Project/Program Assistantships (PAs). Other possible university appointments include fellowships, traineeships, reader/grader, and student hourly positions. Students should contact their program for information on how to obtain an assistantship.\nMore information can be found in the Payroll Benefits appendix.\nThe Graduate Assistant Policies and Procedures (GAPP) outline employment-related practices for graduate student teaching, research, and project assistants.\nSee Enrollment Requirements, Fellowships, Maximum Levels of Appointments, Project or Program Assistant (PA), Research Assistant (RA), Teaching Assistant (TA), Traineeships\nStudents should not attend classes without being enrolled. Faculty and instructors may require enrolled students to attend scheduled meetings of a class and/or to participate in other course-related activities, including online learning. Students are responsible for materials presented in such meetings or activities. Because courses are designed and conducted in diverse ways, faculty and instructors should inform students in writing at the beginning of each course if there are specific expectations for attendance/participation, including whether any component of the grade is based on such attendance/participation.\nSee Religious and Election Day Observances Policy and Guidelines in the Academic Calendar for more information.\nA student auditing a course is expected to attend classes on a regular basis as an observer. Audits are not free; a course taken for audit costs the same as a course taken for credit. If students are not paying full-time fees, they will be assessed per-credit fees for an audit course. Auditors do not take examinations or submit class work. Auditors will receive a final grade of either S (Satisfactory) or NR (No Report). Audit courses do not satisfy any credit, coursework, or degree requirements, nor do they count in fulfilling minimum or maximum credits required in each term. Students holding assistantships and fellowships should be particularly aware of the enrollment requirement for their appointment, as audit requests will be denied if auditing the course would drop them below the required number of graded credits.  If students audit a course and do not attend or drop it, they will receive a grade of NR (No Report). Dissertators are not allowed to audit.  Dissertators who wish to audit a course will be removed from dissertator fee status and assessed regular graduate student fees and also will need to enroll in the appropriate number of graded credits (see enrollment requirements). Students who have research assistantship, fellowship or traineeship appointments are required to be enrolled full-time; audited courses do not count toward full-time enrollment.\nInstructors may limit the number of auditors in a course and may restrict participation of auditors in courses inappropriate for that function. For example, courses that by their nature require participation (seminars, research, laboratory, performance, or language courses) are typically considered inappropriate for auditing.  Additionally, independent study courses are not appropriate for auditing.\nTo audit a course, a student must first obtain the consent of the instructor. The student must follow the procedures established in the program offering the course. Graduate School Dean’s approval is required for all course changes, including audit; see the Course Changes section of this document for instructions. The Dean’s signature will be fulfilled once submitted to the Graduate School. The deadline to request/cancel permission to audit is the drop deadline, which is the end of the 9th week of class during the fall and spring semester. Requests for late audits will not be considered. Specific deadline dates, including those for summer sessions, are posted prior to each semester by the Office of the Registrar.\nThe enrollment system counts all credits in determining maximum credit loads. A Credit Overload Request from is required if a student’s total credit load exceeds the maximum limit per term.\nSee Authorization for Courses, Course Changes, Credit Changes, Dean’s Approval, Dissertator Status, Enrollment Requirements, Overloads, Refunds\nEnrollment authorization may be required for certain courses and/or situations, such as:\nOnce authorized by the program offering the course, students then may enroll in the course.\nSee Add/Drop, Auditing Courses, Credit Changes, Pass/Fail\nProject/Program Assistants (PAs), Research Assistants (RAs), and Teaching Assistants (TAs), fellows, and trainees who hold at least a 33% appointment (or an equivalent) may be eligible for health insurance, vacation, sick leave, and remission of tuition. Students should contact their department/program staff benefits coordinator for details.\nGraduate students enrolled in service-based pricing programs, such as online and accelerated programs, are ineligible to receive tuition remission. See a list of UW–Madison academic programs with service-based pricing (NetID login required).\nSee Enrollment Requirements, Insurance and Medical Benefits, Tuition Remission, Payroll Benefits\nBreadth is a required component of doctoral training at UW–Madison. Given there are multiple paths to breadth, the Graduate School leaves the choice of whether students achieve breadth through a minor or other means up to the specific program.\nIf students do not wish to attend a semester and drop all courses before the first day of classes, they officially cancel their enrollment, owe no tuition or fees for that term, and have no semester entry on their transcript. In this case, it is not necessary for the student to submit a withdrawal request through MyUW.\nOn or after the first day of class, students who no longer wish to remain enrolled need to submit an electronic withdrawal request via MyUW Student Center. More information about canceling enrollment or withdrawal requests can be found on the Registrar’s website.\nSee Withdrawal\nThe university offers capstone certificates for students not currently enrolled in a UW–Madison graduate degree program. Applicants must have completed a baccalaureate degree or equivalent credential from an accredited college or university. The capstone certificate is designed to ‘cap off’ undergraduate experience or to offer a focused professionally oriented experience. Capstone programs do not lead to the conferral of a graduate degree. Further information about capstone certificates can be found on the Professional Degrees & Certificates website.\nSee Graduate/Professional Certificates, Specialist Certificates\nDissertators who do not plan on finishing their degree may request a Certificate of Doctoral Candidacy in recognition of their completion of all requirements toward the doctoral degree except for the dissertation (sometimes called all but dissertation/ABD at other institutions). The certificate shows the date of the preliminary examination as well as the issue date, but does not substitute for an official transcript from the Office of the Registrar. To obtain the certificate, students, advisors, or graduate coordinators should contact the Graduate School Degree Coordinator.\nSee Dissertator Status\nFor purposes of certification to government or private agencies, the Office of the Registrar determines enrollment status as full-time or part-time according to institutional policies, which may differ from full-time or part-time requirements imposed by individual schools or programs. Certification of official enrollment for loan deferment, medical and auto insurance forms, and credit card applications can be obtained by going to the Office of the Registrar’s verifications webpage.\nVeterans Certification: Student Veterans who are eligible for Federal and State Educational Benefits should apply for certification of enrollment at University Veteran Services. Students receiving veterans’ benefits are required to promptly report any credit change or withdrawal from school to University Veteran Services.\nSee Enrollment Requirements\nIf you have completed all degree requirements and deposited your thesis or dissertation and are waiting until the next degree conferral date to receive your degree, you may request from the Office of the Registrar a Degree Completion Letter (Degree Verification) indicating that all requirements have been completed. Important: All grades from the semester in which you are depositing your dissertation (and all other outstanding grades) must be reported before you can receive a completion letter.\nSince master’s and doctoral degrees do not appear on transcripts until 4 to 6 weeks after the end of a semester, students may wish to obtain this letter from the Registrar’s Office to provide to employers or other universities to verify degree completion before the transcript posting, but after all grades are finalized and their dissertation (doctoral degree) or thesis (if required for the master’s degree) is approved and deposited.\nSee Degree Conferral/Payroll End Dates, Holds\nA student may change their degree level, for example, if students with a master’s degree plan have completed their master’s degree and want to continue in the same program for the doctoral degree. To change degree level, see Applying to Add/Change Program, Plan, or Named Option.\nA named option is a formally documented sub-major within an academic major program. Named options appear on the transcript with degree conferral. The Graduate Faculty Executive Committee approves official named options. Many programs may also have unofficial specializations, concentrations, or tracks; unlike named options these do not appear on the transcript. Find more information on named options. To report a change in degree named option, see Applying to Add/Change Program, Plan, or Named Option.\nFor questions, please contact the Graduate School Degree Coordinator.\nSee Applying to Add/Change Program, Plan, or Named Option, Programs (or ‘Majors’)\nCommittees advise and evaluate satisfactory progress, administer preliminary and final oral examinations, evaluate a thesis or dissertation, and/or sign a degree warrant. A student’s program arranges a committee with appropriate expertise to afford the breadth and depth needed in degree examinations. The responsibilities of individual committee members are determined by the program. The executive committee (or its equivalent) of a program/department is responsible for approving the composition of all graduate committees. The final warrant request which includes committee membership must be submitted to the Graduate School at least three weeks before the examination date. Students should consult their advisor and their program’s student handbook for the specific function of degree committees in their program.\nUse this online tool to help you determine whether the proposed committee would meet the following criteria.\nTHE GRADUATE SCHOOL REQUIREMENTS FOR GRADUATE COMMITTEES ARE AS FOLLOWS:\nFor doctoral committees/final oral examination committees:\n1. The chair or one of the co-chairs of the committee must be graduate faculty1 from the student’s program.  (Note:  Faculty who retire or resign retain graduate faculty status for one year and can serve as chair or a co-chair during that time.)4,5\n2. The committee must have at least four members. The committee must have members from at least two University of Wisconsin—Madison graduate programs.3,5    \n3. Three of the committee members must be UW–Madison graduate faculty or former UW–Madison graduate faculty up to one year after resignation or retirement.\n4. At least three committee members must be designated as readers.6\n5. The fourth member and any additional members may be from any of the following categories, as approved by the program executive committee (or its equivalent): graduate faculty, faculty from a department without a graduate program1, academic staff2 (including emeritus faculty), visiting faculty, faculty from other institutions, scientists, research associates, and other individuals deemed qualified by the executive committee (or its equivalent).\n6. All committee members have voting rights. To receive a doctoral degree, students cannot receive more than one dissenting vote from their committee on the final degree warrant.\nFor MFA final committees:\n1. The chair or one of the co-chairs of the committee must be graduate faculty1 from the student’s program.  (Note:  Faculty who retire or resign retain graduate faculty status for one year and can serve as chair or a co-chair during that time.)4,5\n2. The committee must have at least four members.\n3. Three of the committee members must be UW–Madison graduate faculty or former UW–Madison graduate faculty up to one year after resignation or retirement.\n4. The fourth member and any additional members may be from any of the following categories, as approved by the program executive committee (or its equivalent): graduate faculty, faculty from a department without a graduate program1, academic staff2 (including emeritus faculty), visiting faculty, faculty from other institutions, scientists, research associates, and other individuals deemed qualified by the executive committee (or its equivalent).\n5. All committee members have voting rights. To receive a MFA degree, students cannot receive more than one dissenting vote from their committee on the final degree warrant.\nFor master’s thesis committees:\n1. The chair or one of the co-chairs of the committee must be graduate faculty1 from the student’s program.  (Note:  Faculty who retire or resign retain graduate faculty status for one year and can serve as chair or a co-chair during that time.)3,5\n2. The committee must have at least three members.\n3. Two of the committee members must be UW–Madison graduate faculty or former UW–Madison graduate faculty up to one year after resignation or retirement.\n4. The third member and any additional members may be from any of the following categories, as approved by the program executive committee (or its equivalent): graduate faculty, faculty from a department without a graduate program1, academic staff2 (including emeritus faculty), visiting faculty, faculty from other institutions, scientists, research associates, and other individuals deemed qualified by the executive committee (or its equivalent).\n5. All committee members have voting rights. To receive a master’s degree, students cannot receive more than one dissenting vote from their committee on the final degree warrant.\nFor master’s non-thesis committees:\n1. The committees must have at least one graduate faculty1 from the student’s program.3,5\n2. To receive a master’s degree, students cannot receive more than one dissenting vote from their committee on the final degree warrant.\nFootnotes:\n1 Graduate Faculty: The UW–Madison Faculty Policies and Procedures 3.05 contains the policies and exceptions regarding the graduate faculty status.\n2 Academic Staff: The UW–Madison Faculty Policies and Procedures 3.05H contains the policy related to academic staff serving on the committees.\n3 Program: Programs are officially approved courses of study and research leading to a master’s or doctoral degree. They may be administered from within a disciplinary department or across departments by an interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary cluster of faculty. Some programs have official areas of concentration within them (called named options or subplans) at the master’s and/or doctoral levels. Both programs and named options appear on the student’s transcript. Some programs have unofficial tracks, specializations, or concentrations, but these are not listed on the transcript. Contact the program’s graduate coordinator for more information.\n4 The advisor does not have to be chair of the committee, although it is often the case. Moreover, the co-advisors/co-chairs will be designated in the dissertation document.\n5 Note that affiliate appointments may be used to satisfy this requirement.\n6 Readers: Committee members who commit themselves to closely reading and reviewing the entire dissertation. The rationale for specifically designating non-reader status is to facilitate faculty participation in dissertations without automatically expecting the level of commitment associated with deeply engaging a PhD thesis. Given faculty workloads, designating a non-reader in some cases may permit faculty participation where engagement would otherwise be impossible. As long as the Graduate School minimum of at least three committee members that are readers is upheld, programs will remain in compliance with Graduate School policy. Programs may choose to have stricter requirements.\nSee Advisor\nThe Graduate School supports the principles of a compassionate tuition adjustment to accommodate students who withdraw in the following circumstance:\nThe dean or the dean’s designee will assess the meaning and effect of the event on the student and the request for tuition adjustment. Students requesting a tuition adjustment should submit their request in writing to Academic Services in the Graduate School, along with written support for the request from the student’s faculty advisor and/or graduate program chair. Relevant documentation may be required.\nSee Dean’s Approval\nConcurrent appointments describes a situation where a graduate student holds multiple appointments as a fellow, trainee, and/or graduate assistant. Federal agencies and non-federal donors often place restrictions on the amount of work in which an awardee may engage, or on additional stipends an awardee may receive. In addition, the university has a concurrent appointment policy that places limits on multiple appointments for fellows or trainees.\nWhenever assistantships (RA, TA, or PA) are combined with fellowships or traineeships, total compensation cannot exceed the department’s full-time RA rate that was reported to the Graduate School for the current year (fellowship/traineeship + assistantship = total compensation). The list of approved program rates can be found on the Graduate Assistantships webpage, under “Assistantship stipends by program”.\nThe concurrent appointment policy for fellows/trainees can be found here in the University of Wisconsin-Madison Policy for Supplementation and Concurrent Appointments for Graduate Students Holding Predoctoral Fellowships or Traineeships.\nSee Maximum Levels of Appointments\nOnce students achieve dissertator status they must maintain continuous enrollment until completion of the doctoral degree. In order to maintain continuous enrollment, dissertators must enroll each fall and spring semester for 3 credits (300 or above) directly related to their dissertation research (generally research and thesis and/or required seminars). In some cases, the 3 credits can be a combination of research and a seminar. Fall and spring enrollment are required whether or not they reside in Madison.\nAudits and pass/fail do not satisfy this requirement. Additional courses taken audit or pass/fail will result in removal of dissertator fee status.\nStudents are exempt from the requirement to enroll for the summer term, unless they are defending and/or depositing their dissertation or have a Research Assistantship (RA), fellowship, or traineeship that requires summer enrollment, or are using university facilities (including faculty and staff time).\nIf dissertators do not maintain continuous enrollment, they will be assessed a degree completion fee equal to 12 times the current per-credit rate in effect at the time that they submit their dissertation to the Graduate School for final review.\nSee Degree Completion Fee, Dissertator Status, Enrollment Requirements, Readmission to Graduate School (for previously enrolled graduate students)\nPrior to making changes to courses, be sure to review the Office of the Registrar’s Enrollment Deadlines Page for important dates and deadlines, and the Graduate School’s Enrollment Requirements including important information about minimum credits required.\nPrior to deadlines, students may make course changes online via MyUW Student Center. See the Late Enrollment/Late Course Change/Late Drop document for changing enrollment after the deadlines.\nIf a course change is made after the fee refund deadlines (including audited, modular, and zero-credit courses) students may owe additional money, even if the total number of credits for which they are enrolled does not change. The Bursar’s Office will notify students if they owe additional fees or are entitled to a refund.\nStudents holding graduate assistantships, fellowships, and traineeships must meet minimum enrollment requirements when making course changes.\nInternational students considering a course change that may drop them to part-time status must first receive authorization from International Student Services (ISS). This will ensure that they remain in compliance with Department of Homeland Security (DHS) visa regulations. International students holding graduate assistantships, fellowships, and traineeships must meet minimum enrollment requirements as well.\nFor more information and questions, contact the Office of the Registrar or Graduate School Academic Services. The Registrar’s Office also offers demos and tutorials for course enrollment. For instructions on how to late add/change/drop a class, visit the Late Enrollment/Late Course Change/Late Drop document.\nSee Add/Drop, Auditing Courses, Authorization for Courses, Credit Changes, Enrollment Requirements, Late Enrollment/Late Course Change/Late Drop, Section Changes, Tuition and Fee Information\nThe number assigned to a course gives an indication of for whom the course is intended. While graduate students can enroll in courses numbered under 300, those courses do not count for any credits toward a graduate degree or for minimum enrollment requirements.\nThe Minimum Graduate Coursework Policy requires at least 50% of a graduate degree coursework be taken with courses that have the graduate level course attribute. See the Course Attributes Policy for specific information on courses that meet this requirement.\nSee also Continuous Enrollment Requirement, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Prior Coursework\nStudents are not allowed to enroll for more or fewer credits than indicated for a course in the Schedule of Classes.\nFor more information and questions, contact the Office of the Registrar or Graduate School Office of Academic Services.

Any course numbered 300 or above that is taken for credit/no credit will count toward the Graduate School’s minimum graduate degree credit requirement and the minimum graduate residence credit requirement (including 300-level courses in English as a Second Language). Visit the Office of the Registrar’s Valid Grades webpage for more information.\nStudents are responsible for learning about and complying with campus deadlines. Failure to meet deadlines for enrollment, payment of fees, changing courses or credits, and receiving a degree can cost time, money, or both. The Office of the Registrar’s Enrollment Deadlines page lists enrollment, fee payment, and course change deadlines. Visit the Graduate School’s Degree Deadlines page for more information about the deadlines for achieving dissertator status or receiving a degree in any given semester.\nGraduate students should note that Graduate School deadlines do not necessarily correspond to undergraduate enrollment deadlines. Refer to the Office of the Registrar’s Enrollment Deadlines for detailed and specific enrollment and refund deadlines and dates.\nSee Add/Drop, Course Changes, Pass/Fail, Withdrawal\nThe Graduate School acts as the academic dean’s office for all graduate students. If a student needs a dean’s approval or authorization, they should contact the Graduate School Office of Academic Services at gsacserv@grad.wisc.edu.\nIn lieu of enrollment, the Graduate School may approve payment of a degree completion fee for a master’s degree candidate who has completed all of the degree requirements except thesis defense, comprehensive examination(s), presentation of a final project, or removal of an incomplete grade. To be eligible students must have submitted their final thesis or project paper to their advisor while they were enrolled. This fee is comparable to 2 graduate credits at the current resident tuition rate. This fee is established annually and assessed per semester. Students should ask their program to submit a Degree Completion Fee Request Form to the Graduate School on their behalf before the beginning of the semester when students are completing a master’s degree. After the Graduate School approves the request, the fee will be added to the student’s account. Students must pay the completion fee before the program requests a warrant.\nThe Graduate School requires all dissertators to maintain continuous enrollment (see the continuous enrollment policy for dissertators). Dissertators must enroll in the semester(s) in which they defend, submit their dissertations, and graduate (see enrollment requirements for dissertators). In rare circumstances where this is not possible, a degree completion fee is assessed to recognize the inevitable use of university facilities (including faculty and staff time) up to and including the successful defense and submission of the dissertation. The fee is equal to 12 times the current per-credit dissertator rate in effect at the time the dissertation is submitted. The fee is assessed at the time dissertators are ready to complete the degree and is based on the resident or nonresident tuition status dissertators had at their last term of enrollment. If dissertators break enrollment and then reenter and enroll for less than 4 continuous terms before completion, they will pay a prorated rate (the 12-credit fee minus all continuous enrollment credits paid since the time of readmission). If enrollment is broken, but a dissertator reenters and enrolls for at least 4 continuous terms, then a completion fee is not assessed. Students must pay the completion fee before the program requests a warrant\nSee Continuous Enrollment Requirement for Dissertators, Enrollment Requirements\nGraduate students who complete all degree requirements at any point during a term remain officially enrolled and retain student status through the official degree conferral date for that term, as determined by the Secretary of the Faculty and posted as conferral date on the transcript. Degrees are granted three times per year in May, August, and December. The official conferral date can be found on the Office of the Registrar’s Dates & Deadlines webpage.\nGraduate assistants, fellows, and trainees may remain on the payroll until the end of the term, as stated above, or may be removed if necessary for a change of status (e.g. to a postdoc or academic staff position) or end of grant funding. If a student is removed, the Bursar’s Office will check with the Graduate School to confirm graduation at the end of the given term and will maintain tuition remission for appropriately funded students if the student remains on payroll through the dates listed below:\nInternational students: contact International Student Services for guidance on the degree completion date and its impact on the visa status. The dates listed above may be different for international students.\nThe “Window Period” is the time between the end of one degree period and the beginning of the next. Students are eligible to complete their degree requirements during the window period if they were registered for the previous semester (fall, spring, or summer). If all degree requirements are met by the end of the window period, a student’s degree will be granted for the following semester. Students will not have to register or pay fees for the next semester.\nStudents receiving window period degrees may remain on payroll and retain student status only through the dates listed below:\nSee Certification of Graduation (or ‘Degree Completion Letter’), Graduation\nA computerized graduate degree summary is not prepared for graduate students (e.g. the Degree Audit Reporting System, or DARS). Students’ programs, particularly their advisors, are responsible for ensuring timely fulfillment of Graduate School and program requirements. Students should consult their program’s satisfactory progress criteria in their program’s student handbook, or in the Graduate Guide.\nStudents and programs can check academic progress using the Graduate Student Tracking System.\nSee Advisor, Satisfactory Progress\nStudents with disabilities are encouraged to inform their faculty advisor and instructor of their need for disability-related accommodations in a timely manner. Implementation of reasonable accommodations is a shared faculty and student responsibility. Faculty, either directly or in coordination with the McBurney Disability Resource Center, are expected to work with students to identify and provide reasonable accommodations.\nThe McBurney Disability Resource Center provides disability-related services and accommodations to undergraduate, graduate, professional, special and guest students. The Center works closely with students and faculty on the provision of reasonable accommodations to ensure access to the learning environment. The Center makes referrals to other campus offices or community resources for non-classroom accommodations such as housing, transportation, personal care attendants, etc. Students should contact the Center upon admission to begin the eligibility for services process. Early notice is essential in order to have services and accommodations in place prior to the start of the semester.\nMcBurney Disability Resource Center\n702 West Johnson Street, Suite 2104\n608/263-2741 (voice)\n608/225-7956 (text)\nmcburney@studentlife.wisc.edu\nSee Discrimination\nIn conformance with applicable federal and state law and with university policy, UW–Madison does not discriminate on the basis of age, ancestry, color, creed, disability, ethnicity, marital or parental status, national origin, pregnancy, race, religion, disability, retaliation for making a complaint of discrimination or taking part in an investigation relating to discrimination, sex, sexual orientation, or veteran’s status with regard to treatment of students in the educational programs or activities that the university operates.\nShould students wish to speak to someone about discrimination or harassment protected by federal or state laws or campus policies, they should contact the Office of Compliance or the Office of Student Assistance and Support.\nA doctoral dissertation must be a dissertator’s own work. If it is the result of research enterprises in which others have collaborated, a substantial portion must represent the dissertator’s own contribution and the other research participants must be identified.\nEffective September 1, 2017, dissertations must acknowledge contributions received from other individuals, including co-authors of published work that appears in the document, such as in designing the research, executing the research, analyzing the data, interpreting the data/research, or writing, proofing, or copyediting the manuscript.\nPublication of the doctoral dissertation is required. The university uses ProQuest UMI ETD Administrator to publish the dissertation electronically and on microfilm and to publish an abstract of the dissertation in Dissertation Abstracts, a monthly publication. Dissertators must pay the cost of processing the dissertation and publishing the abstract by ProQuest.\nAll doctoral dissertations are reviewed by the Graduate School’s Office of Academic Services. More information can be found on the Graduate School’s Completing Your Degree webpage.\nMost master’s theses at UW–Madison are not published through ProQuest, although a student may choose to do so. If students want to publish their master’s thesis through ProQuest, they should contact the Graduate School’s Office of Academic Services.\nSee Copyright, Deadlines\nDissertator is a unique fee status for students who have completed all requirements for a doctoral degree except for the dissertation. To be eligible for dissertator fee status, a student must:\nDissertator status is effective at the start of the semester following completion of all dissertator requirements for the doctoral degree except for the dissertation. In order to initiate the change to dissertator status, the prelim warrant must be sent to the Graduate School in a timely fashion. Students can check on dissertator status by contacting their graduate program coordinator. All dissertator requirements must be met before the first day of classes to be a dissertator for any given semester. If all dissertator requirements are completed before the first day of classes but the signed prelim warrant does not reach the Graduate School by that deadline, the student can still become a dissertator that semester. Submit the warrant to the Graduate School as soon as possible and enroll for at least 3 credits (usually 990 research) for that semester. Removal of Dissertator Status: A dissertator who enrolls for more (or fewer) than 3 credits will be removed from dissertator status for the fall or spring term in which the enrollment is not exactly 3 credits. During the summer, however, an enrolled dissertator may ask their advisor to request an overload of 1-2 additional credits in a short session and still retain dissertator fee status, if the course is related to dissertation research or professional training that is not offered in regular semesters. The removal of dissertator status may have the following consequences:\nIf a dissertator wants to pursue a graduate degree or certificate in another area, the dissertator fee status will be discontinued and regular graduate fees will be assessed, with possible consequences listed above.

Given there are multiple paths to breadth, the Graduate School leaves the choice of whether students achieve breadth through a doctoral minor (two options as described below), Graduate/Professional certificate, or other means up to the specific graduate program.  The specific Breadth Requirement Policy, including information on certificates, is found here: https://policy.wisc.edu/library/UW-1200\nMinor options are as follows:\nOption A (external doctoral minor): Requires a minimum of 9 credits in a doctoral minor program (single disciplinary or multi-disciplinary). Fulfillment of this option requires the approval of the doctoral minor program.\nOption B (distributed doctoral minor): Requires a minimum of 9 credits in one or more programs forming a coherent topic.  Fulfillment of this option requires the approval of the doctoral major program.\nThe Graduate School’s minimum course requirements for the doctoral minor include:\nA student cannot earn a doctoral minor and a Graduate/Professional certificate of the same name. Credits earned towards the doctoral minor may count towards the minimum graduate residence requirement, minimum graduate degree requirement, and the minimum graduate coursework (50%) requirement.\nSee Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Prior Coursework\nDouble degrees are two same-level (master’s or doctoral) degrees from two separate graduate programs. Students completing a double degree earn two degrees (two programs), and receive two diplomas. Double degree candidates have two advisors and two separate committees, and they complete two theses (master’s) or dissertations (doctoral).\nStudents may apply for an additional program at the time of original application, add a program at any time during their enrollment, or reapply and pursue a second degree after completion of the first.  Students should inquire with each program prior to enrollment to see if additional policies exist that would restrict the ability to complete a double degree.\nIn all scenarios, regardless of whether double degree programs are completed consecutively or concurrently, students must:\nApproval of the double degree: at the time of graduation, each program must submit to the Graduate School a list of the courses being used to satisfy that program’s requirements. Both advisors must sign the course lists as indication of approval. The Graduate School will review the course lists for credit overlap between degrees.\nDoctoral students who add a master’s degree program outside the doctoral program cannot be dissertators.\nInternational students must contact International Student Services before adding a second degree program.\nSee Addition/Change of Program, Plan, or Named Option, Change of Degree Level (Plan), International Students Maintaining Legal Status, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Appendix 5 – Double, Joint, and Dual Degrees at a Glance\nA dual degree is two degrees, one of which is granted in a graduate program, and the other in a professional school (e.g., MD, JD, DVM, DPharm, MPH). Students must inquire with each program prior to enrollment to see if additional policies exist that would restrict the ability to complete a dual degree.\nTo receive a dual degree students must:\nTuition is determined by a combined fee schedule table. Assessed fees are roughly halfway between graduate fees and professional fees. Credit limits each semester coincide with the professional schools’ higher credit maximums.

This includes all new incoming students, those students continuing from a master’s degree to a doctoral degree, add/change program students, degree completion fee students, and any readmitted students. A student who chooses to discontinue their degree program for a semester or more would return under the requirements in the most recent Academic Policies & Procedures.\nStudents enrolled prior to fall 2014 in a MFA, specialist certificate, or doctoral degree program have the option to complete their degree under the prior policy requirements if they maintain continuous enrollment.\nA student who advances from the master’s level to the doctoral level fall 2014 or after is subject to the requirements in the most current Academic Policies & Procedures.\nAppeals will be considered in exceptional cases. The request for appeal must be made on a student-by-student basis. The appeal should come from the students faculty advisor and/or program chair and be sent to the Graduate School Director of Academic Services. The appeal should include sufficient justification for the request and any supporting documentation.\nSee Continuous Enrollment Requirement\nCourse enrollment is available through MyUW in the Course Search and Enroll App or the Student Center. Once enrolled, students should confirm that they are enrolled in the appropriate number of graduate-level graded courses. Students should enroll early to avoid a late initial enrollment fee and class cancellation due to low enrollment. Visit the Office of the Registrar’s website for more information about enrollment deadlines.\nSee Enrollment Requirements\nStudents are responsible for the accuracy of their enrollment/class schedule and for all tuition, fees, and academic consequences that result from that schedule. Continuing students in good standing may enroll for the next term without special permission from the Graduate School. Before enrolling, students should consult their advisor to approve their class schedule for that term and to determine if they need authorization for any proposed courses. Note that graduate students may not enroll in Honors credits, as those are for undergraduate students only.\nAll students must use the online enrollment system. Instructions on how to enroll using MyUW along with additional enrollment information is available through the Office of the Registrar’s website. The Office of the Registrar also provides enrollment demos and tutorials. All students will receive an email message from the Office of the Registrar about their assigned enrollment appointment time. Students can expect to receive this notification about one week prior to the beginning of the priority enrollment period. There are extra fees for late initial enrollment and late fee payment. These deadlines are available at the Office of the Registrar’s Enrollment Deadlines webpage.\nSee Enrollment, Enrollment Requirements, Holds, Late Enrollment/Late Course Change/Late Drop, Overloads, Readmission to Graduate School (for previously enrolled graduate students), Schedule of Classes\nStudents can confirm their current enrollment status through MyUW.\nFailure to receive a student account invoice does not relieve students of the obligation to meet established fee payment deadlines as displayed in the MyUW Student Center, Class Search. If a student does not receive an invoice by late August (mid-January for spring semester), they can get a copy at the Bursar’s Office.\nALL of the following credit requirements (except F-1 and J-1 visa requirements) must be satisfied by graded courses taken at 300 or above; courses numbered below 300, audit, and pass/fail do not satisfy enrollment requirements.\nFull-time enrollment: The Graduate School considers full-time enrollment to be 8-15 graded credits* taken at 300 or above, excluding pass/fail and audit, during the fall and spring semesters, and 4-12 credits* during the summer term. Dissertators are considered full-time at 3 credits. If students elect not to enroll as full-time students as defined by the Graduate School, they are responsible for knowing about possible obligations that may require full-time status. Such obligations may include visa eligibility, fellowships, assistantships, financial aid, external funding agencies, and program satisfactory progress requirements.\nMaximum enrollment: Non-dissertator maximum credit load is 15 graded credits* taken at 300 or above during the fall and spring semester and 12 credits during the summer term. Any exceptions to the maximum credit load permitted must be obtained via the Credit Overload Request form.\nMinimum enrollment: Non-dissertator minimum credit load is 2 credits* during the fall and spring semesters. Graduate students must be enrolled in their program for at least the minimum requirement in the semester in which they receive a degree; master’s degree students expecting a summer degree must be enrolled in their program for a minimum of 2 graduate credits in any summer session*. Graduate students who do not need to maintain full-time status (including TAs and PAs) have a 2 credit enrollment minimum during fall and spring semesters. Minimum requirements must be fulfilled by courses taken for a grade (not pass/fail or audit) and must be taken at 300 or above.\nUnderload: During the fall and spring semesters, non-dissertators must enroll for a minimum of 2 credits.* Audit and pass/fail courses do not satisfy this enrollment requirement. Dissertators are required to enroll for 3 graded credits taken at 300 or above and directly related to their dissertation research.\nThe specific situations listed below have special enrollment requirements.\nDissertators: Dissertators must enroll in exactly 3 credits* directly related to their dissertation (generally research and thesis or required seminars) during fall and spring semesters. Dissertators are considered full-time at 3 credits*. Dissertators who are summer RAs, trainees or fellows, or who expect to graduate in summer, must enroll in the general 8-week summer session (DHH) for 3 credits*. Additional courses for credit, audit, or pass/fail will result in removal of dissertator status and tuition assessment at the regular graduate rate.\nOnce dissertator status has been achieved, courses other than 990 must be directly related to the dissertation research and approved by the advisor. Dissertators must enroll during the semester or general 8-week summer session (DHH) in which they expect to earn a degree. Students must be enrolled during the semester when they defend the dissertation and when they deposit the dissertation. If defending and depositing in two different semesters, the student is required to be enrolled in both semesters. Students do not have to be dissertators during the semester or summer in which they expect to earn a doctoral degree, but they must be eligible for dissertator status before they complete the doctoral degree, and they must enroll in the semester in which they will graduate.\nIf a student enrolls before the dissertator status is approved, the enrollment system may indicate they are not eligible for that course. The enrollment system does not care if students are dissertators. If students had problems getting into a course, it is probably because permission has not been entered into the enrollment system. Most individualized study courses, such as research and thesis, require instructor’s permission and online authorization before enrollment is possible.\nIf dissertator status is not processed by the segregated fee deadline, students should register for 3 credits and pay regular non-dissertator graduate fees. The fee difference will be adjusted for that semester when dissertator status is indicated in the system.\nMaster’s with thesis required: A master’s degree candidate required to submit a thesis to Memorial Library, as indicated on the degree warrant, must be enrolled in the semester in which they defend their thesis. If a student defends in a window period, they need to have been enrolled in the previous term. A student does not need to be enrolled to deposit their thesis to Memorial Library.\nAssistantship appointees: It is against university policy to hold an assistantship without being appropriately enrolled.  Assistantships include those at UW-Madison as well as any UW System institution, including UW–Extension.\nRA (Research Assistant): RAs are required to carry a full load each semester (8 to 15 credits* including research or thesis credits for non-dissertators, 3 credits* for dissertators) and at least 2 credits* during the general 8-week summer session (DHH) (3 credits* for dissertators). Dissertators who hold assistantships are considered full-time with 3 credits* directly related to their dissertation.\nTA (Teaching Assistant) and PA (Project Assistant):\nMinimum enrollment for PAs and TAs is 2 credits* (3 credits* for dissertators) during the fall and spring semesters.\nFellows: Non-dissertator graduate students holding fellowships that are payrolled through the university must be enrolled full-time: 8 credits* during the fall and spring semester. Fellows who are non-dissertators with 12-month appointments must also enroll in 2 credits* during the general 8-week summer session (DHH). Those who are not payrolled as fellows over the summer are not required to be enrolled. Those who are payrolled as fellows during any part of the summer term must enroll in the general 8-week summer session (DHH). Fellows who are dissertators must enroll in 3 credits* during the fall and spring semesters. Fellows with 12-month appointments who are dissertators must also enroll in 3 credits* during the general 8-week summer session (DHH).\nTrainees: Trainees must carry a full load each fall and spring semester of 8 to 15 credits* including research or thesis credits for non-dissertators (3 credits* for dissertators), and at least 2 credits* during the general 8-week summer session (DHH) (3 credits* for dissertators).\nInternational students: Both F-1 and J-1 student visa regulations require students to be enrolled full-time each fall and spring semester (8 credits, not taken as audit). Summer enrollment is not required by the U.S. federal government regulations for F-1/J-1 visa holders. However, summer enrollment may be required due to other circumstances; see summer enrollment requirements for assistantships, fellowships, traineeships, and graduating students. Failure to maintain full-time status can result in loss of F-1/J-1 student benefits, including on-campus employment and practical/academic training options. Any exceptions to full-time enrollment must be authorized by International Student Services (ISS). Visit the ISS webpage to learn more about visa requirements. Permission from ISS to drop below full-time enrollment does NOT exempt an international student from meeting the enrollment requirement determined by a Teaching Assistantship (TA), Project Assistantship (PA), Research Assistantship (RA), fellowship, traineeship, or dissertator status.\nInternational students-online learning credit limit: F-1 and J-1 student visa holders have restrictions regarding the number of online credits that can be taken during the semester as it relates to fulfilling the full-time enrollment requirement.  There are also restrictions regarding online enrollment during the final term of study-especially when the final term for completion is in summer. For more information, visit the ISS Online Course Enrollment webpage.\nSummer enrollment requirements: Students must be enrolled at UW–Madison if they are using university facilities, including faculty and staff time.\nFinancial aid, loan deferral & taxes: In most cases, students are eligible for federal loans and federal loan payment deferral when enrolled at least half-time, which is 4 credits* for the fall and spring semesters. However, individual cases may vary, and students are advised to seek individual advice at the UW–Madison Office of Student Financial Aid. Payroll and FICA taxes can be impacted if students are not enrolled at least half-time. More information can be found here.\nFull-Time Enrollment Status at a Glance\n* Credit requirements (except F-1 and J-1 visa requirements) must be satisfied by graded courses taken at 300 or above; courses numbered below 300, audit, and pass/fail do not satisfy enrollment requirements.\nSee Authorization for Courses, Continuous Enrollment Requirement, Taxes\nIn extreme and rare circumstances, the Dean(s) of the Graduate School have authority to grant exceptions to existing Graduate School policy.\nThe Graduate School surveys all students graduating with a doctoral or master’s degree.

The SED is to be completed by PhD students, not DMA, DNP or AuD students.\nGraduate School Doctoral Exit Survey (DES): The Graduate School surveys all students graduating with a doctoral degree. The DES collects additional information on academic experiences, e.g., advising and other academic support.\nMaster’s Degree Completion Survey: All students completing master’s degrees are asked to answer a brief online survey about their plans for employment or for additional education. Students will receive an email with a link to the survey at the time of the final warrant request.\nThe doctoral exit surveys must be completed before submitting your dissertation electronically. Each individual survey will provide a certificate of completion once you have submitted the survey. The individual certificates of completion should each be saved as PDF documents to be uploaded in the administrative documents section of the ProQuest/UMI ETD Administrator website.\nDirections for completing the doctoral surveys are in the Graduate School’s Guide to Preparing your Doctoral Dissertation.\nSee Final Oral Examination (Defense)\nA student paying full-time tuition and fees at the UW–Madison campus may ask to take courses at UW–Extension for no additional cost (if the total credit load does not exceed the maximum allowable credit load). A student’s faculty advisor must submit a completed UW–Madison Tuition Waiver Request Form, along with a letter of endorsement to the Graduate School. If the Graduate School approves, the student may take the course without paying additional fees. Courses completed at UW–Extension do not fulfill the Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence, degree, or coursework credit requirements and will not appear on the student’s UW–Madison transcript. Dissertators are not allowed to request a tuition waiver while remaining eligible for the dissertator fee status, they would need to request to be removed from dissertator status and enroll full-time and pay fees at the regular graduate student fee rate.\nSee Dissertator Status, Enrollment Requirements, Overloads\nCourses numbered 300 and above graded F are included in the graduate GPA and do not count toward the Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence, degree, and coursework (50%) credit requirements.\nSee Grade Point Average (GPA) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Repeating Courses\nAlthough the Graduate School does not have a formal leave of absence policy for pre-dissertators, there are a number of family-friendly practices and resources for students considering taking a leave of absence for birth or adoption. Many departments and programs also have local policies. Students should consult with their program coordinator, advisor, and the Graduate School’s Office Academic Services as early as possible in their planning process.\nPlease visit the Graduate School’s Family and Parent Resources webpage for additional information.\nSee Compassionate Tuition Adjustment, Leave of Absence\nFellowships are monetary awards that students use to pursue graduate studies. In general, fellowships require no work obligations on the part of the recipient.\nCampus Fellowships: Merit-based campus and departmental fellowships are sometimes awarded to UW–Madison graduate students by their graduate programs. To inquire about eligibility and application procedures, students must contact their graduate program.\nExternal Fellowships: Many federal agencies, professional organizations, and private foundations provide fellowships for students pursuing graduate studies. Students are encouraged to look for and apply for external fellowships, and to understand the unique terms and conditions of each fellowship for which they apply. The Graduate School supports a number of federal/private fellowships through the provision of tuition support and health insurance. If students are awarded one of these fellowships, they should contact the UW–Madison Fellowship Officer at funding@grad.wisc.edu.\nInternational Fellowships: The Institute for Regional and International Studies serves as a resource center and provides information and support to faculty, students, and staff interested in identifying international research grants, scholarships, and other funding opportunities, including programs sponsored by Fulbright, National Security Education Program (Boren Scholarship), HEA (Higher Education Act), Title VI-FLAS (Foreign Languages and Area Studies), and other program competitions. Questions about funding for international research should be directed to the Institute for Regional and International Studies (IRIS).\nFor further information on fellowships, visit the Graduate School’s Funding Information webpage.\nSee Enrollment Requirements, International Students Maintaining Legal Status, Maximum Levels of Appointments, Tuition Remission, Payroll Benefits for Graduate Assistants, Fellows, and Trainees\nThe final examination (often called “defense”) normally covers a student’s dissertation and areas of study. Students may not take the final examination until they have satisfied all other requirements for their degree. Students’ records must be cleared of incomplete grades and progress grades (other than research) before they can take the final exam.\nDoctoral students have five years from the date of passing their preliminary examinations to take their final examination and deposit their dissertation. Arrangements for the final examination and the  examination committee’s approval of the dissertation are the responsibilities of the student and the program. The graduate program coordinator must submit the final doctoral warrant request to the Graduate School at least three weeks before the final examination.\nAfter the graduate program coordinator submits the doctoral degree warrant request, the Graduate School will review this request and send the approved doctoral degree warrant to the graduate program coordinator. The final warrant should be printed out and committee member signatures should be obtained the defense. To pass the examination, students must receive no more than one dissenting vote from their committee. A missing signature is considered a dissent. Once the final warrant has been signed, an electronic copy should be uploaded in the administrative documents section of the ProQuest/UMI ETD Administrator website. The original signed hard copy of the final warrant should be kept with the student or the graduate program coordinator. For further information, visit the Graduate School’s Guide to Preparing Your Doctoral Dissertation.\nSee Preliminary Examinations, Time Limits\nStudents have five years from the date of their preliminary examination to take their final oral examination and deposit their dissertation.\nAdd/Change Program\nCredit Overload\nLate Course Add\nLate Course Drop\nLate Initial Enrollment\nDegree Completion Fee Request\nTranscript Request\nGrade changes originate with the instructor of the course. The instructor submits a grade change through the MyUW Faculty Center. Instructions are available through the Office of the Registrar’s Grading FAQ webpage. If the change cannot be completed via the online system, the instructor submits a paper Grade Change Form, and the program chair signs and submits it to the Graduate School Office of Academic Services.\nWhile changes from Incomplete or Progress to a final grade are routine and raise no questions, changes from one final grade to another are more serious matters. Doing extra work to improve a final grade is not allowed. Faculty legislation states that final grades can be changed only because of clerical error. Once an instructor announces course grades, a decision to re-evaluate the coursework for all or some of the students breaks faith with those students. The university’s primary concern is that all students in a course are treated consistently and fairly when assigned final grades.\nThe Graduate School requires that students maintain a graduate grade-point average (GPA) of 3.00 (on a 4.00 scale) for all graduate courses (excluding research) to receive a degree. Many programs impose higher standards. Students should check with their program.\nWhen a graduate student’s cumulative GPA drops below a 3.0 for one semester, they are notified via email (copy to grad coordinator) that they are placed on academic probation, and an enrollment hold is placed on the following semester. Students on academic probation cannot continue enrolling until the probationary semester’s grades are reported and their cumulative GPA is above a 3.0.\nCourses taken for audit (S/NR), credit/no credit (CR/N), or pass/fail do not affect the GPA. Research courses graded on a Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) basis do not impact GPA. However, U grades are monitored by the Graduate School for satisfactory progress. A Permanent Incomplete (PI) grade does not impact the GPA. A No Report (NR) or Incomplete (I) grade does not impact the GPA, but in a graded course this is a temporary grade, indicating the instructor has not yet submitted a final grade.\nSee Auditing Courses, Credit/No Credit Grades, No Report (NR) Grades, Pass/Fail, Permanent Incomplete (PI) Grade, Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) Grades, Appendix 3 – Grading System, Appendix 4 – Grade-Point Average Calculation\nUW–Madison uses a 4.00 grading scale (A=4.00, AB=3.50, etc.). Grades are assigned only by instructors and are electronically reported by letter grade. Plus and minus grades are not used.\nStudents should check with individual professors about grading scales for specific courses.\nAll courses taken as a graduate student that are numbered 300 and above in which a student receives a grade of A, AB, B, BC, C, or S will count toward the Graduate School’s minimum credit requirement.  Courses with grades of P (“in progress”) fulfill the Graduate School’s minimum credit requirement only if they are research courses.  Courses taken under the 300 level, or for audit, pass/fail; or in which a  student receives grades of D or F do not count.\nFor courses listed as research, the only permissible final grades are P (Progress), S (Satisfactory), or U (Unsatisfactory). If a P grade is assigned, it will remain until the faculty member assigns a grade of S or U. All previously assigned P grades in research courses will revert to an S or U upon assignment of the final grade. Research courses (even with grades from terms earlier than Summer 1999) do not count in a student’s GPA. Research courses are traditionally reserved for graduate students; however, other students (Law, Medical, Undergraduate, etc.) occasionally enroll for a research course. In these cases, the student’s college can decide to have the course count in the GPA with an academic action submitted to the Office of the Registrar.\nTo convert UW–Madison Law School numerical grades to the Graduate School’s grading scale, the Graduate School uses the following scale:\n85-100 A\n83-84 AB\n77-82 B\n75-76 BC\n72-74 C\n67-71 D\n65-66 F\nInternational equivalencies may be available in the Wisconsin Directory of International Institutions.\nSee Grade Point Average (GPA) Requirement, Permanent Incomplete (PI) Grade, Progress (P) Grades, Grading System and GPA Calculation\nGrades are assigned only by instructors and are reported only by letter grade. Plus and minus grades are not accepted.\nThe university uses the following grading system:\nGrade Grade-points per credit\nThe following grades have no associated grade points and are excluded from the graduate Grade Point Average (GPA):\nThe UW–Madison Cross College Advising Service GPA Calculator may be a useful tool.\nGraduate/professional certificates are available to all degree-seeking graduate and professional students (GRAD, LAW, MED, PHARM, VMED careers) and may be used by doctoral students in meeting their breadth requirement (see policy on Breadth Requirement in Doctoral Training). Graduate/professional certificate programs coordinate teaching and research among scholars active in interrelated disciplines. Consult the certificate program regarding recognition of program completion. Certificate programs monitor their own course and satisfactory progress requirements.\nStudents wishing to pursue a certificate must submit a request to add it to their academic career through the Add/Change/Discontinue application process in the MyGradPortal. This should be done as soon as a student knows they wish to add the certificate and before completing the classes for the certificate.  The certificate must be on the student’s academic career before the prelim (doctoral students) or degree warrant (master’s students) is requested.\nA list of all graduate/professional certificates with specific information for each is  available in the Graduate Guide on the Graduate/Professional Certificates page.\nSee Capstone Certificates\nTo receive a master’s degree, students contact their program coordinator at the beginning of the term in which they intend to graduate. The program coordinator will check that they have met program requirements and will request a warrant from the Graduate School on the student’s behalf. Students need to be enrolled in their program and taking a minimum of 2 credits (graded courses taken at 300 or above; audits and pass/fails do not satisfy this requirement) during the term in which they intend to graduate. For more information and deadlines visit the Graduate School’s Completing Your Master’s Degree webpage.\nDoctoral candidates’ major programs should request a final doctoral warrant at least 3 weeks before the anticipated date of their final dissertation defense. Doctoral candidates must be enrolled during the term in which they intend to defend or graduate. For more information and deadlines visit the Graduate School’s Completing Your Doctoral Degree webpage.\nSee Certification of Graduation (or ‘Degree Completion Letter’), Deadlines, Degree Completion Fee, Degree Conferral/Payroll End Dates, Dissertation and Thesis Standards and Publishing, Dissertation Defense (Final Examination)\nIf a student feels unfairly treated or aggrieved by faculty, staff, or another student, the university offers several avenues to resolve the concern. All graduate programs, departments and schools/colleges have established specific grievance procedures for handling such situations; these grievance procedures are found in the program’s Graduate Guide page under the policy tab.\nThe department-school/college academic grievance process should be used to resolve academic issues or disputes. Examples of matters suitable for this process may include a qualifying exam failure, author dispute, or concerns regarding advising/mentoring, to name a few.\nGraduate Assistants in TA, PA and/or RA appointments may utilize the Graduate Assistantship Policies and Procedures (GAPP) grievance process to resolve employment-related issues. Examples of matters appropriate for the GAPP grievance process include allegations of violation of GAPP, including allegations excessive work hours, violations of sick days or vacation policies, or disputes regarding the assignment of duties.\nFor issues involving hostile and intimidating behavior (HIB) by a faculty or staff member, students should contact the Graduate School Assistant Dean for Academic Services for information on accessing the the appropriate HIB process.\nFor issues involving civil rights, ADA, Equal Opportunity or Sexual Misconduct, students should contact the Office of Compliance.\nIf you have questions about whether the grievance policy at the program level or GAPP procedure would be suitable for your concern, you are encouraged to reach out to your college, school or division human resources representative.\nThrough A Graduate Student Guide to Working with Faculty Advisors, an interactive, self-paced micro-course, graduate students learn about the characteristics of functional and dysfunctional relationships with faculty advisors, strategies for communicating effectively and aligning expectations, as well as program grievance processes and Hostile and Intimidating Behavior resources. Completion of the micro-course takes about 20 minutes and is optional but encouraged for all graduate students.\nIn addition, the following administrative offices have procedures available for addressing various concerns:\nOffice of Student Assistance and Support (for all issues of concern involving students)\n70 Bascom Hall\n608-263-5700\nEmployee Assistance Office (for conflicts involving graduate assistants and other employees)\nRm. 1109 WARF Building, 610 Walnut St.\n608-263-2987\nOmbuds Office for Faculty and Staff (for graduate students and post-docs, as well as faculty and staff)\n523-524 Lowell Center\n608-265-9992\nGraduate School (for informal advice at any level of review and for official appeals of program/departmental or school/college grievance decisions)\n217 Bascom Hall\n500 Lincoln Drive\nMadison, WI 53706-1380\n608-262-2433\nGraduate students have two levels of appeal when they disagree with the outcome of a grievance or academic decision made at the program/departmental level; these occur in sequence. The first appeal is to the school/college and final appeals are to the Graduate School.\nGraduate School Appeal Process\nGraduate students who believe their appeal was not appropriately handled or resolved at the school/college level may appeal to the Graduate School using the process described below. (For students in programs housed in the Graduate School, the appeal of a program decision will typically be handled by the school/college in which the faculty/academic advisor of the student has their tenure/primary appointment before an appeal may be considered by the Graduate School.)\nAppeals of school/college decisions to the Graduate School should be based upon one or both of the following grounds:\nIf a student believes that their appeal meets one or both grounds listed above, they may file an official appeal of a school/college decision with the Graduate School using the process described below.\nA student must submit an appeal to the Graduate School Assistant Dean for Academic Services within 14 calendar days of the school/college decision. Prior to submitting an appeal, students are encouraged to contact the Assistant Dean to obtain information about the process, timelines, and to seek clarification of any questions they may have about the process.\nTo be considered, appeals must include the following information:\nUpon receipt of all the above materials:\nWhen using the enrollment system, students may encounter holds on their records, preventing them from enrolling in classes. Holds can also prevent students from obtaining a transcript, a degree completion letter, certification of status, or a diploma. Their enrollment notification will indicate the type of hold and where it must be cleared. Hold information is also available on MyUW. Students should direct questions to the originator of the hold.\nSee Dean’s Approval, Probation\nThe Graduate School does not have an honors program, and graduate students may not enroll in Honors Only courses or in Honors Optional courses for honors credit or otherwise receive honors credit for completing optional extra work in a course. If a graduate student enrolls in a mixed graduate/undergraduate course section with an Honors Optional designation, the graduate student must maintain the default “do not take with honors” selection for their enrollment. If a graduate student does select “take with Honors” as part of their enrollment for such a course, the Graduate School will remove that Honors status.\nStudents who are unable to complete coursework by the end of the semester may request from the instructor the assignment of the temporary grade of “I” (Incomplete).  Students making a request for an I grade must have been carrying passing grade until near the end of the term.  If the Incomplete grade is granted the student should complete the missing work as soon as possible.  Students who receive an Incomplete grade will receive a warning message from the Graduate School, reminding them that students are not permitted to graduate with an Incomplete grade on their transcripts. Graduate students are allowed the subsequent semester of enrollment to complete the coursework before the Graduate School will place the student on academic probation. Programs may impose more stringent rules for satisfactory progress.\nIn consultation with the program, students may be dismissed from the Graduate School for failing to complete coursework and receive a final grade in a timely fashion.\nStudents with outstanding Incomplete grades may not receive  dissertator status or be granted a degree.\nIf the work is no longer relevant, the instructor of a course is no longer at the university, or a change of program makes completion of the work unnecessary, students may be allowed to receive a Permanent Incomplete (PI) for the course. The instructor of the course or their advisor submits a grade change request with an explanation or reason, changing the grade from I to PI. The Office of the Registrar also converts any incomplete grade over 5 years old to PI. Students may graduate with PI’s on their transcript.\nUnresolved Incomplete grades lapse to a grade of Permanent Incomplete (PI) after five years.\nSee Permanent Incomplete (PI) Grade, Probation, Satisfactory Progress\nUW–Madison recommends all graduate students and postdoctoral researchers utilize Individual Development Plans to set academic and career goals and facilitate conversations with their mentor(s). All graduate students and postdoctoral researchers supported by NIH funding are required to have an Individual Development Plan (IDP). Other funding agencies may have additional requirements related to the IDP.\nIDPs are written plans that give mentees ownership and structure to assess their skills, interests, and values, define clear and actionable goals, explore career options, and facilitate conversations with their mentor(s). IDP forms vary greatly, although many are structured around core competencies or learning outcomes. The onus for writing, maintaining, and implementing the plan is on the mentee, and conversations with and feedback from the mentor(s) are essential.\nThe Graduate School will identify individuals who must complete an IDP and will notify them of tools and resources available. The Graduate School will offer graduate students, postdocs, and PIs tools to track IDP progress. The IDP tracking tool will log activity related to the IDP, but the actual contents of the IDP will not be captured by the tracking tool. The contents of the IDP are private to the mentee, who chooses which parts of the IDP to share with his or her selected mentor(s). Find the IDP template for graduate students and postdoc mentees, guidelines and other supporting resources for mentors and mentees, resources for PIs and grants administrators, including the IDP tracking tool.\nIf students have been awarded a fellowship, traineeship, or an assistantship with at least a one-third (33%) appointment per term (or an equivalent), they qualify for full medical benefits. In order to activate medical insurance benefits, students contact their department’s/program’s benefits coordinator.\nStudents who are currently enrolled as UW–Madison students and have paid segregated fees can also use the services of University Health Services (UHS). University Health Services is the health clinic on campus, open to any current UW–Madison student (excluding guest students). UHS offers insurance through SHIP (Student Health Insurance Plan), which is located on the premises. SHIP is a comprehensive insurance plan for UW–Madison students that covers additional health care costs incurred both at UHS and elsewhere. This includes travel and meningitis immunizations, prescription drugs, and oral contraceptives at UHS as well as after hours, emergency room, hospitalization, and other specialized medical services locally and nationwide.\nFor more information or questions, contact UHS or SHIP.\nInternational students, or visiting J-1 scholars, and their visa dependents residing in the U.S. must meet the mandatory health insurance requirements of UW–Madison. International students must show compliance with these requirements by registering with the SHIP office. Students may register either by enrolling in the SHIP Health Plan or by filing a waiver application (if they satisfy the qualifying conditions). Failure to register by the specified deadlines will result in a $100 late fee in addition to any required SHIP premiums.\nPlease note: Students do not have to file a waiver if they have employment through UW–Madison and they meet all of the following conditions:\nIf a student meets all of the above criteria, the SHIP office will file an automatic waiver on his/her behalf.\nAdditional information regarding SHIP, including enrollment and waiver policies, can be found here.\nGraduate students traveling abroad for study or research are encouraged to acquire international health insurance through Cultural Insurance Services International (CISI). All University of Wisconsin students studying/traveling abroad under a UW sponsored program must enroll in health insurance through CISI). Further information about international health insurance can be found here.\nSee Benefits, Appendix 2 – Payroll Benefits\nA joint degree consists of one graduate degree with two programs. A student completing a joint degree writes one thesis or dissertation and receives one diploma. Students can earn a joint master’s or a joint doctoral degree. Such degrees are relatively rare. Students should inquire with each program prior to enrollment to see if additional policies exist that would restrict the ability to complete a joint degree.\nTo apply for a joint degree a student must submit a proposal for the degree to the Graduate School along with an electronic Add/Change/Discontinue Program Request. A student must be admitted to the second program. An appropriate Associate Dean of the Graduate School reviews all such proposals.\nStudents must submit the proposal before they complete the coursework and no later than the beginning of their second year of graduate study.\nThe joint degree proposal must address the following issues:\nTo receive a joint degree, students must:\nOnce a joint degree proposal has been reviewed and approved, any and all changes must be submitted to the Graduate School for further review.\nFor further details about joint degrees, contact the Graduate School Office of Academic Services.\nSee Double Degrees, Dual Degrees: Graduate and Professional Combination, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Special Graduate Committee Degrees, Appendix 5 – Double, Joint, and Dual Degrees at a Glance\nIf a student is called to jury duty and the duty is sustained over a period of three weeks or more, the student should be allowed to withdraw from classes. If extended jury duty should continue after the last day of class, the instructor has the option of assigning an Incomplete (I) as the student’s grade. The I grade will not result in academic probation or the removal of dissertator status. Further information is available at Graduate School’s Office of Academic Services.\nEach program sets its own language requirements. Some programs require competence in one or more languages before students can take preliminary examinations. Students must check with their major program’s criteria for satisfactory progress in the program’s student handbook, or in the Graduate Guide.\nIt is a student’s responsibility to be aware of the deadlines for enrollment each term. All session deadlines are adhered to as detailed on the Office of the Registrar’s Enrollment Deadlines page.\nLate Initial Enrollment: Students have through the end of the second week to enroll in courses for fall or spring term. If students enroll after the first week of class, they are subject to late payment fees. Permission to enroll late does not excuse students from paying late initial enrollment and/or late payment penalties. Exceptions to the published deadlines will be granted only in the case of truly mitigating circumstances. Late initial enrollment cannot be completed in MyUW; a Late initial Enrollment Request Form must be submitted along with written approval from the student’s faculty advisor. Refer to the chart below for detailed steps to late initial enrollment.\nLate course changes (add a class, change credit, change sections): After deadlines have passed, late course adds can be requested by submitting a completed Late Course Add Request Form to the Graduate School. Other courses changes may be requested via the Course Change Request in MyUW. For more information, see the Registrar’s Office enrollment overview.  For all changes, the Course Change Request must be printed from MyUW and required signatures must be obtained along with written approval from the student’s faculty advisor. Refer to the chart below for detailed steps to late course changes. The Dean’s signature will be fulfilled once submitted to the Graduate School.\nLate Drop: The electronic Course Change Request process via MyUW Student Center is not accessible for late drops. Students must complete the Graduate School Late Course Drop Request Form along with written justification from the student’s faculty advisor. Please note that poor academic performance in a course is not an acceptable reason for a late drop request.  Refer to the chart below for detailed steps to late drops.\nFor more information about late enrollment, late course change or late drop, contact the Graduate School Office of Academic Services.\nSee Course Changes, Dean’s Approval\nThe Graduate School does not have a formal policy on leave of absence for pre-dissertators. Students should notify their graduate program of their intention to take a leave of absence.\nIf students have pre-enrolled for a future term and plan to take a leave of absence, they must be sure to drop all courses before the first day of class.\nPreviously enrolled students who wish to return to Graduate School should follow the instructions for Readmission to Graduate School. Any student who does not enroll for a fall or spring term is considered to be a reentry and must pay the Graduate School online application fee. Any student granted readmission must adhere to the most current requirements as listed in the Graduate School Academic Policies & Procedures. Master’s degree students who have been absent for five or more consecutive years lose all credits that they have earned before their absence. Doctoral degree students who have been absent for ten or more consecutive years lose all credits that they have earned before their absence. Individual programs may count the coursework students completed prior to their absence for meeting program requirements; however that coursework will not count toward Graduate School credit requirements.\nNon-dissertators: The Graduate School has no formal policy regarding a leave of absence at the pre-dissertator level, although some programs do. Therefore, it is critical that students contact their major programs before considering a break in enrollment of one or more terms.\nDissertators: A candidate for a doctoral degree should be aware that failure to take the final oral examination and submit the dissertation within 5 years after passing the preliminary examination may require another preliminary examination and admittance to candidacy a second time. In addition, the Graduate School requires all dissertators to maintain continuous enrollment. In rare circumstances when this is not possible, a degree completion fee is assessed to recognize the inevitable use of university facilities (including faculty and staff time) up to and including the successful defense of the dissertation.\nInternational Students: International students considering a leave of absence should check on their visa status with International Student Services.\nGraduate Appointments: Students with Teaching Assistantships (TA), Program Assistantships (PA), or Research Assistantships (RA) should consult with their program, their PI and/or advisor. Students with Fellowships or Traineeships should contact their funding source.\nSee Degree Completion Fee, Family Leave, International Students Maintaining Legal Status, Readmission to Graduate School (for previously enrolled graduate students), Time Limits\nNon-dissertator students are allowed to enroll for a maximum of 15 credits. The enrollment system counts all credits in determining maximum credit loads. Even though pass/fail courses, audit courses, and 100- or 200-level courses are considered undergraduate level credits, they are counted in total credit load.\nSee Enrollment Requirements\nUniversity policy restricts appointment levels for Project, Research, or Teaching Assistants; fellows; trainees; and university staff who are enrolled as graduate students. The levels established by the university are maximums, not minimums or expected levels.\nProject Assistant (PA) and Teaching Assistant (TA)\nAppointments exceeding 75% for domestic students are rare and require approval of the advisor and chair of the payrolling program(s), the payrolling college dean’s office(s), and the Graduate School. Some colleges, schools, or programs may set lower limits, but in general require prior specific approvals if the appointment or some combination of appointments exceeds 75%. Project Assistants may be employed 100% during summer term, semester breaks, and spring vacation. International students cannot have an appointment exceeding 50% during the spring and fall terms. International students should refer to information from International Student Services for additional appointment restrictions.\nResearch Assistant (RA)\nAppointments exceeding 50% are not permitted. Domestic students may have a combination of appointments not exceeding 75% with no more than 50% being the RA appointment. International students cannot have any combination of a RA and another appointment over 50%. International students should refer to information from International Student Services for additional appointment restrictions.\nPredoctoral Fellows/Trainees\nStudents can hold a concurrent appointment as a TA, RA, PA, or student hourly with their fellowship within the limits set out in the current university policy. Whenever assistantships (RA, TA, or PA) are combined with fellowships or traineeships, total compensation cannot exceed the full-time RA rate of the student’s academic home department, as it was reported to the Graduate School for the current year (fellowship/traineeship + assistantship = total compensation). The list of approved program rates can be found on the Graduate Assistantships webpage, under Assistantship Stipends by Program. More information about concurrent appointment policy for fellows/trainees can be found in the University of Wisconsin–Madison Policy for Supplementation and Concurrent Appointments for Graduate Students Holding Predoctoral Fellowships or Traineeships.\nLimited/Academic Staff, Non-dissertators\nCombinations of appointment percentages and academic load percentage exceeding 175% are very unusual because of the difficulty that such academic loads place on the ability of the employee to perform their responsibilities. Therefore, approval by the employing division’s dean/director (or designee) is required prior to the start of classes. The Graduate School dean should be informed in writing of any approved requests. See Chapter 11.03 of the Unclassified Personnel Policies and Procedures document for the current university policy entitled, Employees Enrolled as UW–Madison Students.\nLimited/Academic Staff, Dissertators\nCombinations of appointment percentages and academic load percentage exceeding 175% are more common because dissertators have no classes to attend. Although these are approved only at the program chair or director level, the employing unit’s dean/director (or designee) and the Dean of the Graduate School must be informed in writing of any approved requests. See Chapter 11.03 of the Unclassified Personnel Policies and Procedures document for the current university policy entitled, Employees Enrolled as UW–Madison Students.\nStudent hourly\nIn some situations it may be appropriate to hire graduate students as student hourly help. Employers should contact their Dean’s office to determine when this is appropriate. Maximum levels for appointments also include student hourly appointments. See Chapter 1.06 of the Unclassified Personnel Policies and Procedures document for the current university policy entitled, Student Hourly Help.\nFor any combination of appointments (except fellowships and traineeships), the total appointment percentage may not exceed 75%.\nA 100% academic load for graduate students is:\nIf a student holds an assistantship concurrently with a staff appointment, the combination of appointments may not exceed 75%, regardless of the number of credits for which the student is enrolled.\nFurther information about maximum levels of appointments can be found in the University of Wisconsin–Madison Maximum Levels of Graduate Assistantship Appointments Policy\nSee Enrollment Requirements,\nThe minimum graduate coursework (50%) requirement states that at least 50% of credits applied toward the program’s graduate degree credit requirement must be courses designed for graduate work (this includes but is not limited to online, thesis/research, independent study, and practicum/internship credits).  Courses taken as a University Special student are not allowed to count toward the 50% graduate coursework minimum unless taken at the 700 level or above.\nFor students taking coursework through the fall 2015 term, the official university record which identifies programs documented “graduate level” coursework is each program’s Minimum Degree Requirements and Satisfactory Progress chart in the 2014-2016 Graduate School catalog.  The official University documentation of “graduate level” coursework is identified with the graduate course attribute (G50%) in the University’s Course Guide and Class Search. More information regarding the course attribute can be found on the Academic Planning and Institutional Research (APIR) website.\nStudents should be aware that some programs may require more rigorous credit minimums than the Graduate School’s minimum. Students should visit their program’s Minimum Degree Requirements and Satisfactory Progress chart and contact their graduate program coordinator for program specific degree requirements.\nSee Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Prior Coursework, University Special Student Status, Time Limits\nThe Graduate School’s minimum graduate degree credit requirement is a degree requirement instituted by the Graduate Faculty Executive Committee to ensure that a graduate degree meets institution accreditation standards (this includes but is not limited to online, thesis/research, independent study, and practicum internships credits).\nGraduate Degree Credit Minimums\nMaster’s Degree: 30 credits\n(except MFA)\nM.F.A. /Specialist Certificate: 42 credits\n(may include master’s degree credits taken at UW–Madison)\nDoctoral Degree: 51 credits\n(may include master’s degree credits taken at UW–Madison and credits take while a dissertator)\nThe doctoral degree minimum graduate degree credit requirement may be achieved with credits earned before or after dissertator status. The credits applied towards a master’s degree, a doctoral minor, or taken as a dissertator shall count towards the related doctoral graduate degree credit requirement.\nStudents should be aware that some programs may require more rigorous credit requirements than the Graduate School’s minimum requirements. Students should contact their graduate program coordinator for further information.\nSee Dissertator Status, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Prior Coursework, Time Limits\nThe Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence credit requirement for graduation can be satisfied only with courses numbered 300 and above taken as a graduate student at UW–Madison (this includes but is not limited to online, thesis/research, independent study, practicum/internship credits).\nGraduate Residence Credit Minimums:\nMaster’s degree: 16 credits\n(except MFA)\nMFA/Specialist certificate: 24 credits\n(may include Master’s degree credits taken at UW–Madison)\nDoctoral degree: 32 credits\n(must be completed prior to achieving dissertator status; may include master’s degree credits taken at UW–Madison)\nIn rare circumstances, courses taken as a University Special student maybe allowed to count toward the minimum graduate residence credit requirement. These credits generally are not allowed to count toward the 50% graduate coursework minimum.\nCredits applied to the minimum graduate residence credit requirement must be earned while enrolled as a graduate student at UW–Madison and can also count toward the minimum graduate degree credit requirement.\nSee Dissertator Status, Grading System, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Pass/Fail, Prior Coursework, Progress (P) Grades, Time Limits, Traveling Scholar Program\nMinnesota residents who are certified by the Minnesota Office of Higher Education (MOHE) for the appropriate term/summer session to attend UW–Madison under the Minnesota-Wisconsin Tuition Reciprocity Agreement will be assessed the approved reciprocity tuition rate, plus the segregated fees assessed for all UW–Madison students. Students under this program will be classified as nonresidents of Wisconsin.\nStudents with a Research Assistantship (RA), that covers all instructional costs, will be billed as nonresidents, not Minnesota reciprocity rates. The end result to the student is the same, as students are only responsible for the segregated fees.\nStudents who are not certified for the program prior to the date fees are due must either pay nonresident rates and be refunded the difference in tuition upon certification by MOHE, or delay payment until certification is issued and include the $100.00 late payment fee due at that time.\nIt is the student’s responsibility to inquire of MOHE about the suitability of reapplying, application procedures, and deadlines. Questions and application requests should be directed to the Minnesota Office of Higher Education.\nThe university holds graduate students to a high standard of academic integrity and believes that misconduct may warrant university discipline in addition to sanctions imposed by an instructor. Graduate students who have been found by their instructors to commit academic misconduct can expect that the Office for Student Conduct and Community Standards will consider whether to impose a further disciplinary sanction of university probation, suspension, or expulsion.\nChapter 14 of the University of Wisconsin Administrative Code defines academic misconduct as follows:\nAcademic misconduct is an act in which a student:\nExamples of academic misconduct include but are not limited to:\nThe full text of the state statute governing academic misconduct, University of Wisconsin System (UWS) 14, Student Academic Disciplinary Procedures, as well as the UW–campus procedures for implementing the provisions of UWS 14 and general information about academic misconduct, are available here or from the Division of Student Life.\nChapter 17 of the University of Wisconsin Administrative Code describes non-academic misconduct as follows:\nThe university may discipline a student in non-academic matters in the following situations:\nExamples of non-academic misconduct include but are not limited to:\nThe full text of the state statute governing non-academic misconduct, UWS 17, Student Non-Academic Misconduct Disciplinary Procedures, as well as the UW campus procedures for implementing the provisions of UWS 17 and general information about non-academic misconduct, are available here or from the Division of Student Life.\nA No Report (NR) grade on a student’s record indicates that the instructor for the course has not yet submitted a final grade for the student’s work at the end of the grading period. This grade is not the same as an Incomplete (I), which indicates that the student’s work was unfinished at the end of the term.\nAll grades for 790, 890, 990 that are unreported (previously assigned an NR) by the end of the grading period will be automatically assigned a P (Progress). The P grades will automatically revert to S grades upon assignment of the grade for the final semester of enrollment in the course. If the instructors had intended a different grade (S, U, or I), they would need to use the electronic grade change process.\nSee Grading System, Incomplete Grades, Progress (P) Grades, Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) Grades\nStudents are allowed to enroll for a maximum of 15 credits during fall and spring. Summer maximum enrollment is 12 credits. Credits included are those courses numbered 300 or above, taken for a grade (not including audits and pass/fail).\nDissertators are not eligible for overloads in the fall or spring terms. However, in the summer, a dissertator who is enrolled in the general 8-week session for 3 credits may request an overload for 1-2 additional credits in a short session and still retain dissertator status.  For such requests to be approved, the course must be related to dissertation research or professional training that is not offered in regular semesters. Faculty advisors can request an overload exception for summer from the Graduate School Degree Coordinator.\nThe enrollment system counts all credits in determining maximum credit loads. An overload request is required if a student wishes to exceed the maximum number of credits they are allowed as a graduate student. Even though pass/fail courses, audit courses, and 100- or 200-level courses are not considered graduate level credits, they are counted in a total credit load. An overload request is also required if the number of credits exceeds the span of weeks in any short session during the summer (but not for a dissertator).\nIf a student wishes to enroll for more than the maximum credit load, they must submit a Credit Overload Request form, signed by their advisor, to the Graduate School Office of Academic Services. The Graduate School will look closely at the rationale for the request, the student’s course load, satisfactory progress, and assistantships. Overloads to 16-17 credits during the fall and spring semesters are generally allowed. Overloads to 18 credits are only approved for fall/spring if some of the credits are taken in a short term prior to or during the semester  If the Graduate School approves the overload, the student will then be allowed to add the course.\nSee Enrollment Requirements, Maximum Levels of Appointments\nPass/fail courses do not satisfy any Graduate School credit, coursework, or degree requirements, nor do they fulfill minimum or maximum credits required each term. Tuition is still charged for pass/fail course. For these reasons, very few graduate students choose pass/fail for courses numbered 300 or above. Seminars, independent study, and research may not be taken pass/fail. The pass/fail option is not to be confused with the S/U grading option.\nStudents requesting to enroll in a course as pass/fail must first enroll or be enrolled in the course.  The request is made via the MyUW Student Center by submitting an online Course Change Request, changing the course to pass/fail. After the student requests this change online via MyUW Student Center, they submit the pass/fail form to the Graduate School either electronically at gsacserv@grad.wisc.edu or in person in room 217 Bascom Hall where it is reviewed and approved by the Graduate School.  The deadline to request/cancel pass/fail is the drop deadline, which is the end of the 9th week of class during the fall and spring semester. Requests for late pass/fail will not be considered. Specific deadline dates, including those for summer sessions, are posted prior to each semester by the Office of the Registrar.\nThe instructor does not know that a student is taking the course on a pass/fail basis and therefore reports a letter grade for the course. The Registrar records a grade of S in place of the instructors’ grades of A, AB, B, BC, or C; and a grade of U in place of D or F grades. Neither the S nor the U are computed in the graduate grade-point average.\nThe enrollment system counts all credits in determining maximum credit loads. A Credit Overload Request is required if a student’s total credit load exceeds the maximum limit per term.\nSee Dean’s Approval, Enrollment Requirements, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Overloads, Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) Grades\n1 May deduct tuition, fees, and books from stipends when calculating taxable income.\n2 Except international students. See your payroll coordinator.\n3 Half-time enrollment is required for exemption.\n4 The university provides fellows and trainees a summary of stipend payments each January.\n5 Graduate students enrolled in service-based pricing programs, such as online and accelerated programs, are ineligible to receive tuition remission. See a list of UW–Madison academic programs with service-based pricing (NetID login required).\n6 Does not include segregated fees which are the responsibility of the student.\n*This information is intended as a guideline and specific benefits eligibility should be reviewed at: https://www.wisconsin.edu/ohrwd/admin/download/eligibilitydecisiontable.pdf.\nSee Incomplete Grades\nThe Graduate Portal is an online resource for students and graduate coordinators. Students use the Portal to complete academic actions such as adding or changing their major, discovering professional development opportunities, and submitting payment for the completion of their doctoral degrees. Graduate Coordinators request degree warrants (master’s, preliminary exams, and doctoral) through the Portal.  Students should spend time becoming familiar with the Portal and its features.\nChoosing an action button will display an associated window, which will show fields appropriate for the type of request.\nThe preliminary examination is a significant milestone in a doctoral student’s academic career. It is given to assess knowledge of areas within the academic discipline. Passing of the preliminary area exam, obtaining approval of the minor if the major program requires it, and completing all the major course requirements culminate in admission to candidacy for the doctoral degree.\nStudents’ eligibility to take the prelim examination(s) is determined by their program. The program notifies the Graduate School of a student’s admission to candidacy on the preliminary warrant, which must be requested 3 weeks prior to the exam date. The number of examinations and their content vary from program to program. A student’s program administers the examination(s).\nAfter passing the preliminary examination, students have 5 years to take the final examination (i.e. dissertation defense) and deposit their dissertation. The 5-year clock starts on the first day of instruction of the term (Fall, Spring, or Summer) immediately following the completion of the preliminary examination. Failure to complete their degree within this period may result in students having to retake the preliminary examination and be re-admitted to candidacy.\nTo offer flexibility amidst the major disruption that COVID-19 may have had on doctoral candidates’ research and scholarship progress, students who achieved dissertator status by the end of the 2020 summer term have automatically had the 5-year time limit extended by 8 months. Dissertators given this 8-month extension who need more time due to continued COVID-related disruption to their progress may request a further extension from the Graduate School. Decisions to extend the deadline beyond the additional 8 months are made on a case-by-case basis upon request of the student and approval of their advisor. Upon advisor approval, the advisor then requests an extension from the Graduate School by submitting the request to the PhD degree coordinator at gsacserv@grad.wisc.edu.\nSee Certificate of Doctoral Candidacy, Dissertator Status, Time Limits, Warrants\nThe Graduate School does not transfer credits for previous coursework.  However, a student’s program may decide to accept coursework completed outside of the student’s graduate career at UW–Madison under the conditions detailed below.  Any prior coursework accepted under these parameters must have been rigorous and meet the expectations of a graduate work for the degree. Coursework earned five or more years prior to admission to a master’s degree or coursework earned ten or more years prior to admission to a doctoral degree is not allowed to satisfy requirements.\nSatisfying Requirements with Prior Graduate Coursework from Other Institutions\nA student’s program may decide to accept graduate coursework completed at another institution (earned post-baccalaureate) toward fulfillment of minimum degree, minimum graduate coursework, and minor credit requirements. This work will not appear on a UW–Madison transcript nor count towards the graduate career GPA. The Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence credit requirement can be satisfied only with courses taken as a graduate student at UW–Madison. The only exception is graduate-level coursework taken as a Big Ten Academic Alliance Traveling Scholar.\nSatisfying Requirements with Coursework from Undergraduate Career at UW–Madison\nFor well-prepared advanced students, a student’s program may decide to accept up to seven credits numbered 300 or above of required or elective courses from the undergraduate work completed at UW–Madison towards fulfillment of minimum degree and minor credit requirements. However, this work would not be allowed to count toward the 50% graduate coursework minimum unless taken at the 700 level or above. This work will not appear on the graduate career portion of UW–Madison transcript nor count towards the graduate career GPA. The Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence credit requirement can be satisfied only with courses taken as a graduate student at UW–Madison.\nSatisfying Requirements with Coursework from Undergraduate Career outside of UW-Madison (Policy on Exceptions for Specialized Accreditation to Allow Undergraduate Credits Towards a Graduate Degree)\nWhen considering the undergraduate category of prior coursework, the Graduate Faculty Executive Committee (GFEC) restricts the seven credits of undergraduate work to UW-Madison courses because of the challenges associated with assessing the rigor of courses taught at other institutions.\nAccredited programs may request an exception to this policy to allow up to seven credits of undergraduate coursework from other institutions to count toward a graduate degree based on specialized accreditation.  The process for requesting an exception was approved by the GFEC in 2014 and is as follows in italics:\nAn exception to allow up to seven credits from an undergraduate degree earned at a non UW- Madison institution to count toward a UW-Madison graduate degree can be requested on a program-by-program basis when the following two conditions are met:\n1) students have received their undergraduate degree in the same discipline as they are pursuing graduate work, and\n2) the undergraduate degree has been granted from a program which is accredited by the same accrediting body as the UW-Madison program.\nShould a program decide to request an exception to this policy, it must provide the Graduate School with information requested on the undergraduate credit exception form to be eligible for consideration. Please note submission of an exception request does not provide assurance of its approval.\nIf a program believes a student situation meets these criteria, it must request this exception by completing the steps as outlined in the undergraduate credit exception form.  A request may be made at any time, but please note that the earliest date for implementation is the term AFTER Graduate School approval.  Please direct any questions to Emily Reynolds at emily.reynolds@wisc.edu.\nTransfer from University Special Student Career at UW–Madison\nAfter admission to a graduate program, the student’s program may decide to accept up to fifteen University Special student credits as fulfillment of the minimum graduate residence, graduate degree, or minor credit requirements on occasion as an exception (on a case-by-case basis). In all these cases, the student would have to pay the difference in tuition for the terms in question. Those credits earned in a University Special student semester still appear in the transcript history as “University Special” student, but the Registrar’s Office will add a statement in the beginning of the transcript “All credits taken in [term] as a University Special student have been accepted by the Graduate School toward a degree program” after the student has paid the difference in tuition. UW–Madison coursework taken as a University Special student would not be allowed to count toward the 50% graduate coursework minimum unless taken at the 700 level or above. This work will not appear on the graduate career portion of the UW–Madison transcript nor count towards the graduate career GPA.\n*Fulfillment of requirements is allowed in these instances only if approved by the student’s graduate program.\n**Coursework earned five or more years prior to admission to a master’s degree or coursework earned ten or more years prior to admission to a doctoral degree is not allowed to satisfy requirements.\nPrograms may decide to count previous graduate work from another institute toward fulfillment of degree credit requirements; however, this work will not appear on a UW–Madison transcript, and it does not count toward the Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence credit or graduate coursework (50%) requirements.\nPrior coursework can be used toward the minor requirement in accordance with the Prior Coursework policy chart.\nThe credits used towards a master’s degree and the prior coursework used toward it may also be applied to a related doctoral degree. However, if the prior coursework credit maximums were already reached for the master’s degree (seven UW–Madison undergraduate credits and/or fifteen University Special student credits), then no more prior coursework credits are permissible for the doctoral degree.\nSee Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement\nStudents must be in good academic standing with the Graduate School, their program, and their advisor. The Graduate School regularly reviews the record of any student who received grades of BC, C, D, F, or I in courses numbered 300 or above, or grades of U in research and thesis. This review could result in academic probation with a hold on future enrollment, and the student may be suspended from graduate studies.\nThe Graduate School requires that students maintain a minimum graduate GPA of 3.00 in courses taken as a graduate student (excluding research, audit, credit/no credit, and pass/fail courses). The Graduate School also considers Incomplete (I) grades to be unsatisfactory if they are not removed during the subsequent semester of enrollment; however, the instructor may impose an earlier deadline. The Graduate School may also put students on probation for incompletes not cleared within one term. All incomplete grades must be resolved before a degree is granted.\nIf students were admitted on probation and they satisfy the conditions outlined at the time of admission, probationary status will be removed automatically. Once their studies have begun, students are expected to make satisfactory progress toward their degree.\nSee Grade Point Average (GPA) Requirement, Holds, Incompletes, Satisfactory Progress, Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) Grades\nPrograms are officially approved courses of study and research leading to a master’s or doctoral degree. They may be administered from within a disciplinary department or across departments by an interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary cluster of faculty. Some programs have official areas of concentration within them (called Named Options or Subplans) at the master’s and/or doctoral levels. Both programs and named options appear on the student’s transcript. Some programs have unofficial tracks, specializations, or concentrations but these are not listed on the transcript. Contact the program’s graduate coordinator for more information.\nStudents who would like to pursue an individual program different from approved programs should see Special Graduate Committee Degrees.\nSee Applying to Add/Change Program, Plan, Certificate or Named Option, Change of Degree Level (Plan) or Degree Named Option (Sub-Major), Doctoral Minors, Special Graduate Committee Degrees\nThe P is an abbreviation for “Progress,” not an abbreviation for “Pass.” It is a temporary grade. Grades of P (except for research and thesis within the program) must be changed before a degree or preliminary exam warrant can be issued.\nIf a P is assigned for research courses numbered 790, 890, and 990, the grade will remain until the faculty member assigns a grade of S or U. All previously assigned P grades in that instructor’s research course will revert to an S or U upon assignment of the S or U grade. Usually this is upon assignment of the final grade for the course in the semester of submitting the dissertation. (All grades for 790, 890, 990 that are unreported by the end of the grading period will be automatically assigned a P.)\nSee Grading System, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, No Report (NR) Grades\nThese titles designate graduate or professional students employed to assist with research, training, or other academic programs or projects. Contact the employing department directly for more information.\nThe Graduate Assistant Policies and Procedures (GAPP) outline employment-related practices for graduate student project assistants.\nSee Concurrent Appointments for Fellows/Trainees, Enrollment Requirements, Maximum Levels of Appointments, Tuition Remission, Payroll Benefits for Graduate Assistants, Fellows, and Trainees\nQualifying examination requirements differ for each program. Students should contact their program to learn about specific requirements.\nSee Preliminary Examinations\nIf graduate students do not continuously enroll during a fall or spring semester, they are required to apply for readmission to the Graduate School through the online application. The readmission process accomplishes two goals: (1) assures the Graduate School that graduate students are in good standing with their academic program; and (2) activates their enrollment eligibility. Further information about readmission for previously enrolled graduate students can be found here. To apply for readmission, graduate students must also contact their program for further details of the readmission process at the program level.\nA returning student who is completing another same level degree within five years must comply with double degree requirements, including the 25% overlap rule.\nAny student being readmitted to a graduate program must adhere to the requirements in the most current Academic Policies & Procedures and Graduate Guide.\nSee Double Degrees, Effective Dates, International Students Maintaining Legal Status, Leave of Absence, Time Limits\nTypically, courses where content can change (such as special topics, seminars, independent studies, and research and thesis) can be repeated within the semester or on a semester basis. Repeated courses may earn course credit and satisfy the Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence, degree, and coursework (50%) credit requirements. Sometimes program authorization is necessary for enrollment.\nStudents are entitled to repeat any didactic course if they or their program feel it is necessary. Both grades will be used in calculating the student’s graduate grade-point average; however, the course will count only once toward the Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence, degree, and coursework (50%) credit requirements.\nSee Failure, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Satisfactory Progress, Appendix 4 – Grade-Point Average Calculation\nA Research Assistant (RA) must be a graduate student working toward a master’s or doctoral degree. Research Assistants are UW–Madison graduate students who are given stipends to support their own education and training. RAs should not be given work assignments unrelated to their own educational pursuits – graduate assistants with significant duties unrelated to their own course of study should be appointed as a PA rather than an RA.\nThe program will give consideration for an RA appointment based on information provided in the application for admission or, in some cases, in a specific program application form. Research Assistants will receive a letter of appointment or reappointment each semester or year they hold their assistantship. If appointed students have not received such a letter, they should contact their payrolling office.\nNote that the RA appointment percentage is merely a mechanism for setting the stipend amount, and does not correlate to any particular requirement for hours of work. The maximum appointment percentage is 50%. However, to account for the potential that RAs may occasionally perform duties that are not directly related to their course of study, the university has deemed an RA appointment to entail 5 hours of compensated employment per week. In no event may an RA be asked to perform more than 5 hours per week of work unrelated to their course of study, regardless of percentage of RA appointment.\nThe Graduate Assistant Policies and Procedures (GAPP) outline employment-related practices for graduate student research assistants.\nWisconsin Statute 36.27(2) governs resident status for tuition purposes. To be eligible for in-state tuition, a student must be a bona fide resident of Wisconsin for at least the 12 months immediately prior to enrollment, or must qualify as a resident for tuition purposes under one of the provisions in the Statutes that waives the 12-month requirement. In determining resident status for tuition purposes, standards are different from those used for voting, paying taxes, etc.\nIf students are classified as nonresident for tuition purposes, they do not automatically become residents for tuition purposes after residing in Wisconsin for one or more years. In cases where it appears the students have entered and remained in Wisconsin principally for educational purposes, a presumption is made that they continue to reside outside the state. The presumption of non-residence continues in effect until rebutted by clear and convincing evidence of bona fide residence.\nProvisions of the statute under which a student may qualify as a resident for tuition purposes without waiting 12 months are:\nFind more information about residence for tuition purposes and the full text of the applicable statute on the Office of the Registrar’s Residence for Tuition Purposes webpage. Students with questions about residence for tuition purposes, or who believe they should be a resident and would like to appeal the nonresident tuition status, may contact the Office of the Registrar’s Residence Counselors.\nThe various areas of responsible conduct of research and associated policies are described below. For more information, see this comprehensive document regarding UW–Madison Research Safety and Compliance Training Requirements and the Research Policy and Compliance Checklist.\nUW–Madison has federal compliance responsibilities that pertain to the use of live, vertebrate animals in research, teaching, and outreach activities. This includes but is not limited to traditional basic and applied research models, instruction of students, and public events. Oversight and evaluation of the humane and ethical use of animals is performed by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUCs). The Research Animal Resource Center (RARC) provides support to the IACUCs and training to animal users necessary to provide the highest quality care and compliance for the university’s research animals. Learn more about the rules and regulations governing the care and use of research animals, how to prepare and submit animal care and use protocols to IACUCs, and how to obtain veterinary and pathology services at the Research Animal Resources Center webpage. Training and protocol approval are required before one can begin research projects involving animals.\nAuthors of a research publication are usually those who provide meaningful intellectual contribution to a project in one or more of the following ways: concept, design, supervision, resources, materials, data collection and processing, analysis or interpretation, literature search and writing. Many academic journals may list very specific requirements for authorship. All authors have rights and responsibilities thus any person listed as an author should be knowledgeable and aware of such. Unless the contributions of the co-authors are listed, each author takes full responsibility for the contents of the work. When asked to serve as a publication reviewer, students should treat this material as confidential. See further information about authorship, publication and peer review.\nThe Conflict of Interest (COI) staff and committee review reports of outside activities and financial interests to comply with federal, state, and university regulations and policies. This committee also works with faculty and staff to eliminate, minimize, or manage any actual or potential financial conflicts of interest identified by the reporting process. For further information see the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research’s Conflict of Interest guidance document and Outside Activities Reporting webpage.\nIn accordance with federal regulations and UW–Madison policies, all research involving human subjects must be reviewed and approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) prior to any research intervention with participants. All graduate research involving human subjects for inclusion in a master’s thesis or doctoral dissertation must be approved by an IRB before beginning the research. Training is required before a project is submitted to an IRB for review. For additional information, see the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research Human Research Protection Program webpage. For additional information visit the Institutional Review Board webpage.\nExcept as required by funding agreements or other university policies, the university does not claim ownership rights in the intellectual property generated during research by its faculty, staff, or students. This policy has proven beneficial to the university, the public, and the creators of such property. In the case of inventions funded in whole or in part by a federal agency or in the case of sponsored research agreements that require the university to grant rights in inventions generated by funding under such agreements, faculty, staff, and students must assign rights to such invention to the university’s designated patent management organization, the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF). Faculty, staff, and students must execute all papers necessary to file patent applications on the invention and establish the federal government’s or other sponsor’s rights in the invention. If there are no specific written agreements or policies to the contrary, the researcher at the university is free to dispose of the rights in the manner of his or her own choosing. The university retains the right to use the products of research conducted as a university activity for its education and research mission. See information and forms for disclosing an invention or read more about intellectual property.\nGraduate education is carried in classrooms, laboratories and other research venues, and is often supported by federal or other external funding sources. Maintaining the integrity of academic and research efforts carried out at UW–Madison is an essential priority. At UW–Madison, graduate students are held to the same standards of responsible conduct of research as faculty and staff. Misconduct in scholarly research is defined as fabrication (making up data), falsification (changing or misreporting data), plagiarism (representing work of others as your own), or other practices that seriously deviate from those that are commonly accepted within the scholarly community for proposing, conducting, or reporting research. For more information, see the overview of Misconduct in Scholarly Research and Faculty Legislation II-314: Misconduct in Scholarly Research. The Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research is responsible for investigating allegations of research misconduct. For more information, contact the Associate Vice Chancellor for Research Policy and Integrity.\nThe University of Wisconsin-Madison strives to foster the highest scholarly and ethical standards among its students, faculty, and staff. As a recipient of federal funding, the University of Wisconsin must comply with federal laws related to civil rights, animal welfare research misconduct, and others. Though extremely rare, we realize there are times when reportable events of wrongdoing, noncompliance, or misconduct may occur in our midst and that it is our responsibility as an academic community to take steps to rectify them. See the Whistleblower Protection Policy and the policy on Obligations and Protections for Graduate Students.\nA patent is an exclusive statutory right available to the inventor or inventors of new material. As inventors, students may have the right to seek patent protection for their invention (for example, for a product that results from the research documented in their dissertation).\nIf students have received support (for example, an appointment as a Research Assistant or Project Assistant) for the work leading to an invention, or used any other university funding, supplies, equipment, or university premises, in the work leading to an invention, they may have obligations that affect their rights to seek patent protection for an invention. It is important to discuss patents with their advisor. Also, students should review the Intellectual Property Policy for Research.\nIf students’ research involves human subjects (including data sets, surveys, human blood, or other body materials), live animals, recombinant DNA, infectious agents, stem cells, or biological toxins, they should consult the Research Ethics webpage.\nThe Office of Biological Safety (OBS) assists faculty, students, and staff in observing safe practices in research in the biological sciences as prescribed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and endeavors to ensure that research is done in secure facilities in compliance with all local, state, and federal regulations. As an institution receiving NIH research funds, UW–Madison is subject to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules (rDNA). OBS provides the administrative mechanism by which research involving rDNA can be reviewed, thereby assuring compliance with the NIH guidelines. This institution adheres to the guidance of the CDC/NIH publication, Biosafety in Biomedical and Microbiological Laboratories. Institutional policies are described in the UW–Madison Researchers’ Biosafety Manual.\nThe UW–Madison Chemical Safety Office, working in conjunction with the campus Chemical Safety Committee, establishes policies and procedures for the safe acquisition, use, storage, and disposal of chemicals on campus. The Chemical Safety Office also advises campus chemical users on best practices and helps the university community comply with federal, state, and local chemical and environmental safety laws. See the Office of Chemical Safety website for additional information.\nThe UW–Madison Office of Radiation Safety provides training on the safe use and handling of radioactive materials, which includes ordering, use, disposal, spill cleanup, and shipping for those employees who will need to ship radioactive materials. The Office of Radiation Safety also provides shielding assessments and dosimetry to those users who require it. Additionally, training on safe use of x-ray generating equipment and lasers is also available. See the Office of Radiation Safety website for additional information.\nContinuation in the Graduate School is at the discretion of a student’s program, the Graduate School, and a student’s faculty advisor.  A student may be placed on probation or dismissed from the Graduate School for not maintaining satisfactory academic progress.  In special cases the Graduate School permits students who do not meet these minimum standards to continue on probation upon recommendation and support of their advisor.\nThe Graduate School sets minimum standards that all graduate students in the university must meet. Many departments and programs have additional requirements that exceed these Graduate School minimum requirements. The definition of satisfactory progress varies by program.\nMost programs require satisfactory progress to continue guaranteed funding support.\nThe Graduate Guide includes the Graduate School’s minimum degree requirements and satisfactory progress chart, as well as each program’s minimum degree requirements and satisfactory progress chart.\nIn determining satisfactory academic progress, the Graduate School monitors the following: cumulative grade point average, incomplete grades, English as a second language for some international students, the grades of students admitted on probationary status, enrollment in minimum required credits (underload), and unsatisfactory (U) grades.  Detailed information for each is below.\nGraduate students must meet the Graduate School’s minimum 3.0 cumulative GPA in order to graduate. Some probationary admission conditions may require higher grades. When a graduate student’s cumulative GPA drops below a 3.0 for one semester, we notify them via email (copy to grad coordinator) that they are placed on academic probation, and we place a GSD LGR enrollment hold on the following semester. They cannot continue enrolling until the probationary semester’s grades are reported and their cumulative GPA is above a 3.0.\nIf a student is placed on probation due to low GPA, they receive an email notification with the graduate coordinator copied.\nIf graduate students have not resolved incompletes by the end of the subsequent semester of enrollment, these grades are considered unsatisfactory. Graduate students are not permitted to graduate with incomplete grades on their record. The Graduate School issues warnings for incompletes that have not yet lapsed into bad standing, and for three or less credits of incompletes. The Graduate School places student on academic probation for having more than three credits of incompletes in bad standing and uses the GSD INC service indicator (enrollment hold) to ensure that this requirement is met before continued enrollment is permitted.\nIf a student is placed on probation due to incompletes, he/she receives an email notification with the graduate coordinator copied.\nInternational graduate students may be required to take the ESLAT upon arrival at UW-Madison. This requirement applies to the following test scores: TOEFL (paper-based) test score is below 580; TOEFL computer based test (CBT) score below 237; (TOEFL internet based iBT) test score below 92; IELTS score below 7; or MELAB below 82. The ESLAT is administered by the English as a Second Language Program (Sandy Arfa, Director). ESLAT results may indicate that a graduate student is exempt from taking an ESL course, or these results may indicate a recommended ESL course. Graduate students for whom the ESLAT was required and who are not exempt based on the test results must enroll in the recommended ESL course during their first semester at UW-Madison. The Graduate School monitors successful completion of the ESL course for these students. The GSD ESL service indicator (enrollment hold) ensures that this requirement is met before continued enrollment is permitted.\nApplicants who do not meet Graduate School admissions requirements may be admitted on probation, with program recommendation and GS Dean’s approval. They are admitted as G17 or G18 (probationary admit) codes, and receive an admission letter from the Graduate School, as well as message in OASIS, that notifies them they are being admitted on probation. These cases are monitored closely to ensure that the students achieve a 3.0 GPA during their first semester of enrollment. A hold is placed (GSD ADT), which prohibits them from enrolling in the following semester classes until their first semester grades are reported and the GPA is above a 3.0.\nGraduate students are required to enroll in a minimum of 2 graded, graduate-level credits each fall and spring semester. Those who are enrolled in only 1 credit each fall and spring semester are notified by the GS that they are under-enrolled. They are required to correct their enrollment immediately, and a GSD UNL hold is placed on their record, prohibiting them from enrolling in the subsequent term, until they meet the minimum enrollment requirement.\nIf a course has been structured to offer the S/U grading option (such as research), a grade of S in that course would mean a grade of B or better. The Graduate School monitors U grades. Since these grades are very rare, cases are handled individually. Upon identification of a graduate student with a U grade in research, we contact the faculty advisor to find out more about the situation. GSD LGR holds are not automatically placed for U grades but may be if necessary.\nSee Grade Point Average (GPA) Requirement, Incompletes, Probation\nFor all courses listed as research, the only permissible grades are Satisfactory (S), Unsatisfactory (U), and Progress (P). Though an Incomplete (I) grade may be assigned, a final grade must be submitted during the following term. If a P grade is assigned, it will remain until the instructor assigns a grade of S or U; all previously assigned P grades should revert to an S or U upon assignment of the final grade in most cases. These courses will not count in the student’s graduate Grade Point Average (GPA).\nResearch courses are traditionally reserved for graduate students; however, other students (Law, Medical, Undergraduate, etc.) occasionally register for a research course. In these cases the student’s college can decide to have the course count in the GPA with an academic action to the Registrar’s Office.\nIf a course has been structured to offer the S/U grading option, a grade of S in that course would mean a grade of B or better. S/U courses are not computed into the grade-point average. They may however satisfy the Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence, degree, and coursework (50%) credit requirements as well as the minor course credit and in considering the minimum or maximum credit load per term. The S/U grading option is not to be confused with the pass/fail option. Unsatisfactory grades do not satisfy any Graduate School’s minimum credit requirements. Programs and the Graduate School monitor students for unsatisfactory grades. Advisor holds may be placed for students with unsatisfactory grades.\nThe use of letter grades (A through F) is encouraged and recommended whenever information on performance permits. Courses designated as research require grading on the S/U basis. In certain seminars and advanced topics courses, where lack of examinations and other performance criteria makes the A-F scale inappropriate, use of the S/U option is permissible.\nSee Grade Point Average (GPA) Requirement, Incompletes, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Pass/Fail, Probation, Progress (P) Grades\nThe Schedule of Classes is available on the Course Search and Enroll App, and students can access the Schedule of Classes via their MyUW Student Center.

See Other Professional Degrees.\nSection changes include: changes in Lectures, Discussions, Labs and Instructors’ course numbers for research or independent study courses for which students are already enrolled. Always consult the Office of the Registrar for deadlines and procedures for section changes.\nIf a student’s name does not appear on the appropriate instructor’s grade roster at the end of the term, a Course Change Request to change sections and a letter of request from the instructor of the class must be submitted to the Graduate School Office of Academic Services. The instructor of the correct section must submit a Grade Change Form to assign a grade. The instructor of the incorrect section should submit no grade.\nSee Course Changes, Grade Change\nUW–Madison prohibits sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking. These offenses violate UW–Madison policies and are subject to disciplinary action. Sanctions can range from reprimand to expulsion from UW–Madison. In many cases, these offenses also violate Wisconsin criminal law and could lead to arrest and criminal prosecution.\nStudents who experience sexual harassment, sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and/or stalking have many options and services available to them on and off campus, including mental health counseling, victim advocacy and access to the criminal and campus disciplinary systems. For a list a confidential support and reporting options, please visit University Health Services.\nAll students are encouraged to report harassment of any kind, whether it is by a faculty or staff member or another student. Students may contact the Office of Student Assistance and Support: visit 70 Bascom Hall, email OSAS@studentaffairs.wisc.edu, call 608-263-5700 and ask to speak to the Dean on Call, or fill out a Bias Incident Reporting Form.\nFaculty, staff, teaching assistants, and others who work directly with students at UW–Madison are required by law to report first-hand knowledge or disclosures of sexual assault to university officials for statistical purposes. In addition, disclosures made to certain university employees, such as academic advisors or university administrators, may be forwarded to the campus Title IX coordinator for a response. For more information, visit the Office of Student Assistance and Support’s Sexual Assault, Dating and Domestic Violence webpage.\nGraduate students are expected to complete an online violence prevention program. Read more about the violence prevention program for graduate students.\nSee Grievances and Appeals\nSpecial graduate committee degrees are one-of-a-kind degrees built around unique needs of individual students that cannot be satisfied by approved programs (e.g., by existing major program/minor combinations, joint degrees, distributed minors, etc.) and may permit individual degrees in new and emerging fields or combinations of disciplines. A higher degree of independence is required on the part of the student, since easily available guidance provided by programs is often more difficult to obtain, and there is not the usual collegial group of students in closely related research and coursework.\nThe master’s and doctoral special graduate committee guidelines are:\nStudents can earn a Specialist Certificate in Educational Leadership and Policy Analysis or a Specialist Certificate in Library and Information Studies. The Specialist Certificate represents work beyond the master’s level. In addition to program requirements, the Graduate School requires that the student must meet all Graduate School minimum degree and satisfactory progress requirements as listed in the Graduate School’s Minimum Degree Requirements and Satisfactory Progress chart in the Graduate Guide.\nFor additional information, contact the programs that offer the Specialist Certificates.\nSee Enrollment Requirements, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Transfer Credits for Prior Coursework, Time Limits\nThe university creates an international context for education by providing opportunities for UW–Madison students to study overseas. Because of the variety of programs, students should coordinate their study abroad program with their graduate program, the Graduate School, and International Academic Programs (IAP).\nStudents intending to study abroad through a UW–Madison approved study abroad program can learn more about their options through International Academic Programs.\nGraduate students who are interested in conducting research abroad can register for IAP’s UW Graduate Research, which allows students to stay continuously registered as UW–Madison students, receive research credit with their faculty advisor, international health insurance, and 24/7 emergency assistance through IAP. This is an individualized experience and is not tied to a specific study abroad program. Students will need to have a high degree of independence in arranging housing and logistics for themselves.\nAll graduate students traveling abroad are encouraged to acquire insurance through Cultural Insurance Services International.\nSee Fellowships, Insurance and Medical Benefits\nMany programs offer Teaching Assistantships. This title is appropriate for graduate students who have been assigned teaching responsibilities in an instructional program under the supervision of a faculty member of the academic staff. Contact the employing program directly for more information about the TA position.\nThe Graduate Assistant Policies and Procedures (GAPP) outline employment-related practices for graduate student teaching assistants.\nSee Enrollment Requirements, Maximum Levels of Appointments, Teaching Assistant (TA) Orientation and Training, Tuition Remission, Payroll Benefits for Graduate Assistants, Fellows, and Trainees\nSome master’s degrees require a thesis to be deposited in the Memorial Library. The Graduate School produces materials that describe the preparation of a thesis. See the Graduate School’s guide to Completing Your Master’s Degree.\nSee Dissertation and Thesis Standards and Publishing\nGraduate degrees are awarded, in part, for completion of current coursework. Students who break enrollment from their graduate program may risk losing all credits earned prior to their absence.\nMaster’s degree: students who have been absent for five or more consecutive years lose all credits that they have earned before their absence.\nDoctoral degree: students who have been absent for ten or more consecutive years lose all credits that they have earned before their absence.\nIndividual programs may count the coursework students completed prior to their absence for meeting program requirements; however that coursework will not count toward Graduate School credit requirements. Although the program may count the coursework students did before their absence towards the program requirements, the Graduate School does not count that work toward the Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence, degree, and coursework (50%) credit requirements.\nA candidate for a doctoral degree who fails to take the final oral examination and deposit the dissertation within 5 years after passing the preliminary examination may be required to take another preliminary examination and to be admitted to candidacy a second time.\nA student’s program may appeal these time limits through a written request to the Graduate School Degree Coordinator. The appeal must provide information demonstrating that the student has remained current in the field of study. This information may include a resume showing applicable work experience and/or official transcripts from other schools attended.\nSee Effective Dates, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Preliminary Examinations, Readmission to Graduate School (for previously enrolled graduate students)\nUnder the Prior Coursework policy, a student’s program may decide to accept graduate coursework completed outside of the students graduate career at UW–Madison when those courses are rigorous and meet the expectations of a graduate work for the degree. Students should contact their program when inquiring about or attempting to transfer graduate work from other institutions. Coursework earned five or more years prior to admission to a master’s degree or coursework earned ten or more years prior to admission to a doctoral degree is not allowed to satisfy Graduate School minimum credit requirements. See the Satisfying Requirements with Prior Graduate Coursework from Other Institution(s) section of the Prior Coursework policy.\nSee Dean’s Approval, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Prior Coursework\nThe Big Ten Academic Alliance sponsors the Traveling Scholar Program as part of a continuing effort to increase cooperative use of its member institutions’ resources.

Find a list of member universities.\nCredits earned by Traveling Scholars are transferred by the home university upon receipt of transcript from the host university. Courses and grades are posted directly on a student’s UW–Madison transcript and, if graduate level, count toward the Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence, degree, and coursework credit requirements. Terms are limited to two semesters or three quarters regardless of the number of courses taken.\nStudents interested in the Traveling Scholars Program should contact the Graduate School Degree Coordinator for an application or more information.\nSee Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Transfer Credits for Prior Coursework\nStudents go to their MyUW Student Center Tuition Account Summary to view their tuition charges, payments, financial aid, loans, scholarships and refunds; and to access links to set up an “Authorized Payer” and view, print, and pay eBills.\nThe tuition bill is provided as an eBill which is published to view, print, or pay online on the Tuition Account eBill/ePayment secure website. An email is sent to notify students and their Authorized Payers each time a new eBill is published. If students want their parents to have access to the website, students must first set them up as Authorized Payers. Detailed Authorized Payer information is available on the Bursar’s Office How to Add an Authorized Payer webpage.\nTuition and fee charges must be paid by the due date indicated on the tuition and fee statement to avoid a $100 late fee. (Late fee is subject to change.) UW–Madison does not accept debit or credit cards for tuition payment. Detailed payment options and information are available on the Bursar’s Office Payment Methods webpage. For tuition account questions or more information, contact the Bursar’s Office at: tuition@bussvc.wisc.edu (include the student name/ID in the email), or by phone: 608-262-3611.\nThe date a course is dropped or the date a student submits an online withdrawal request determines eligibility for a tuition adjustment. For tuition and fee adjustment and assessment questions, visit the Bursar’s Office Tuition Adjustment webpage or contact them at tuition@bussvc.wisc.edu.

For questions, contact the Bursar’s Office at remissions@bussvc.wisc.edu.\nSee Enrollment Requirements, Fellowships, Minnesota/Wisconsin Reciprocity, Project or Program Assistant (PA), Research Assistant (RA), Teaching Assistant (TA), Traineeships, Withdrawal, Payroll Benefits for Graduate Assistants, Fellows, and Trainees\nStudents enrolled as University Special students are considered non-degree candidates and pay tuition and fees at the designated special student rate. See the Transfer Credits for Prior Coursework policy for information on how limited credits taken as a University Special Student may be accepted by a graduate program. Students are not allowed to simultaneously enroll as a graduate student and as a University Special student.\nBefore beginning a graduate program, an international student may choose to study full-time English as a University Special student on an F-1 visa granted through the ESL program or on a J-1 visa with the sponsor’s approval. When the student begins a graduate program, the student’s status will be changed from University Special student to graduate student.\nFor more information visit the Adult Career and Special Student Services website or contact them at advising@dcs.wisc.edu.\nSome didactic courses are offered to both undergraduate and graduate students. Typically undergraduate students enroll for a higher amount of total credits than do graduate students. Courses of this nature are designated in the Schedule of Classes as variable credit courses. Students should consult the Course Search and Enroll App to determine the appropriate credits when enrolling for a variable credit course.\nUniversity Health Services (UHS) has designed an online sexual violence prevention training program specifically for graduate students to promote the health and safety of the campus community by increasing understanding of sexual assault, harassment, dating and domestic violence, and stalking, as well as prevention strategies, resources, victim rights, and reporting options. Starting fall 2017, all new incoming graduate students, admitted summer 2017 or after, are required to complete the 45-minute online training program within their first semester. Failure to complete the training will result in probation and a registration hold.\nFor further information, review the Task Force on Sexual Violence and Harassment recommendations document, which was adopted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents in 2016. For questions, visit the violence prevention program website or email violenceprevention@uhs.wisc.edu.\nA warrant is a program’s recommendation that a student be admitted to doctoral candidacy (a preliminary examination warrant) or be granted a degree (master’s or doctoral degree warrant).  Warrants are requested electronically by the Graduate Program Coordinator.  Once reviewed and approved by the Graduate School Degree Coordinator, the warrant serves as the Graduate School’s notification that a student has met both the Graduate School and program requirements with the exception for  degrees requiring a thesis/dissertation defense or final oral exam/exhibit. Approved warrants for doctoral degrees and master’s degrees requiring a thesis/dissertation defense or final oral exam/exhibit are made available to committee members for signature after evaluating the thesis/dissertation or final oral exam/exhibit.   If the committee decides the student has met this final requirement, the warrant is returned to the Graduate School for final review before the degree is approved (cleared) and awarded (posted).\nSee Certificate of Doctoral Candidacy, Dissertator Status, Dissertation Defense (Final Examination), Preliminary Examinations\nWithdrawal indicates that a student intends to stop attending classes for the current semester. Submission of a withdrawal request in MyUW Student Center is required between the first and last day of the semester, when a student wishes to drop all classes in which they are enrolled for the current semester. Requests are then routed electronically to the Graduate School for review. Approval from the Graduate School, as well as from the Office of International Student Services for students on J-1 and F-1 visas, is required before a graduate student is formally withdrawn from the semester. For more information visit the Office of the Registrar’s Withdraw or Cancel Enrollment for a Term webpage.\nIf students drop all courses before the first day of classes, they officially cancel their enrollment, owe no tuition or fees for that term, and have no semester entry on their transcript. In this case, it is not necessary for the student to submit a withdrawal request to the Graduate School. Students planning to withdraw from their academic program should contact their program directly.\nStudents are considered enrolled for a term if they have courses on their record on or after the first day of classes for that term regardless of whether they have paid tuition and fees. Failure to attend classes or leaving the university informally does not excuse a student from having to pay tuition and fees. If students withdraw after the transcript deadline, a notation with the date of withdrawal will appear on the transcript. Enrollment deadlines are posted by the Office of the Registrar on their Enrollment Deadlines webpage.\nFailure to withdraw properly and promptly can be expensive. Before withdrawing, students should consult the Office of the Registrar’s Enrollment Deadlines webpage for specific deadlines and refund dates. If a student received financial aid from the university, they should consult the Office of Student Financial Aid to determine repayment responsibilities. If students withdraw and are receiving remission of tuition, they are responsible for their entire tuition assessment.\nSee Tuition and Fee Information, Tuition Remission\n• Add/Drop\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is a student’s responsibility to be aware of the add/drop deadlines each term. Consult the Office of the Registrar’s website for essential enrollment information and important deadlines. Courses may be added, dropped, or swapped through MyUW Student Center before and during the first two weeks of a semester (or the first week in the general 8-week summer session).\nIf a student drops a course, swaps out of a course, decreases credits in a variable credit course (via the “edit” function), or withdraws from the university, tuition and fee refunds are dispensed following a strict refund schedule. Modular courses and summer session courses have a shorter refund period.\nInternational students are not allowed to drop below full-time enrollment unless they have first received authorization from International Student Services (ISS). This will ensure that they remain in compliance with Department of Homeland Security (DHS) visa regulations. International students holding graduate assistantships, fellowships, and traineeships must meet minimum enrollment requirements. A reduced course load from ISS does not exempt graduate students holding assistantships, fellowships, and traineeships from these minimum enrollment requirements.\nIf students enroll for a course and do not attend, they must drop the class or receive a grade of NW (No Work) or, for audited classes, NR (No Report). If students make a course change after the fee refund deadlines (including audited, modular, and zero-credit courses), they may be charged a fee even if the total number of credits for which they are enrolled does not change. The Bursar’s Office will notify students if they owe additional fees or are entitled to a refund.\nStudents should be aware that “swap” is a drop action combined with an add action, allowing them to swap from one section to another section within the same course, or swap one course for another course. Some cautions related to swapping courses:\n\nBecause swap is a DROP and an ADD, the refund and assessment schedules and the dropped (DR) grade notation on the transcript deadline dates apply.\nAll session add/drop deadlines follow the Office of the Registrar’s Enrollment Deadlines.\nClass eligibility controls and prerequisites will be adhered to. If the class is closed or a student is not eligible for that class, the swap will NOT occur.\n\nFor more information and questions, contact the Office of the Registrar or Graduate School Office of Academic Services. Demos & Tutorials for course enrollment are available through the Office of the Registrar. For instructions on how to late add/change/drop a class, visit the Late Enrollment/Late Course Change/Late Drop section.\nSee Authorization for Courses, Course Changes, Credit Changes, Dean’s Approval, Enrollment Requirements, Exceptions, Late Enrollment/Late Course Change/Late Drop, Tuition and Fee Information, Withdrawal\n• Because swap is a DROP and an ADD, the refund and assessment schedules and the dropped (DR) grade notation on the transcript deadline dates apply.\n• All session add/drop deadlines follow the Office of the Registrar’s Enrollment Deadlines.\n• Class eligibility controls and prerequisites will be adhered to. If the class is closed or a student is not eligible for that class, the swap will NOT occur.\n• Advisor\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn advisor is a faculty member from the program responsible for providing advice regarding graduate studies and for supervising a student’s degree program (including research). An advisor—sometimes referred to as the major professor, mentor, or trainer—generally serves as chair of a student’s final examination committee.\nThe advisor/student relationship is one of mutual agreement, which may be terminated by either party. If a student changes advisors, they need to notify their program coordinator. It is the responsibility of every graduate student to have an advisor. If students do not have an advisor, the Graduate School may suspend them from further graduate study at UW–Madison until they find an advisor. However, in some cases, particularly for incoming students, the program may assign an advisor.\nWith approval from the program, students can have a co-advisor/co-chair. The co-advisor/co-chair may be from any of the following categories: graduate faculty, faculty from a department without a graduate program, academic staff (including emeritus faculty), visiting faculty, faculty from another institution, scientists, research associates, and other individuals deemed qualified by the program executive committee or its equivalent. Effective September 1, 2017, the co-advisor/co-chair will be designated on dissertation documentation.\nSee Committees (Doctoral/Master’s)\n• Applying to Add/Change Program, Plan, Certificate or Named Option\n\nMore\n\n\n\nCurrently enrolled graduate students who want to apply to add, change, or discontinue a program of study, or add a certificate, do so through the Graduate Student Portal (in the MyGradPortal in MyUW).  An admissions application and fee are not required.\nStudents must check with the intended program concerning admission requirements (for example, letters of recommendation or statement of purpose) and eligibility. Upon receipt of a recommendation from the program, the Graduate School will notify the student of the decision. Note: Changing programs between a service based pricing program and a pooled program during a term are not allowed, so students should always indicate the next academic term when requesting to change between these types of programs. Adding minors, certificates, or discontinuing a program is allowed during a term. Questions regarding the status of an application are best directed to the program.\nIf dissertators want to add a program, typically a master’s program or a certificate program, they cannot concurrently hold dissertator fee status while pursuing the graduate degree or certificate. Dissertators who add a program or a certificate program will be removed from dissertator status and must enroll and pay fees as a regular graduate student.\nInternational students who add/change a program or a certificate program should contact International Student Services to discuss the possible effects this change of program could have on immigration status.\nSteps to Add/Change Program, Plan, or Named Option\nAccess MyUW and the Graduate Student Portal:\n\nGo to my.wisc.edu.\nEnter your NetID login information.\nClick on the tile “Graduate Student Portal”. If you do not see the tile, you can search for it in the top search bar and add it to your page.\n\nInitiating a request:\n\nOnce in your Portal page, select the tile on the home page titled “Add/Change Programs.”\nIn the “Enrolled Programs” section, you will have options to add a Graduate/Professional certificate, doctoral minor (PhD students only), or major. You also have the option to discontinue a program in which you are already enrolled.\nChoose an action button, which will display an associated window and show fields appropriate for the type of request.\nFill out the fields and click the “send” button to complete the initial request.\n\nThe request will show up as “In Review” in the Requests section on the Add/Change Programs page.

Other possible university appointments include fellowships, traineeships, reader/grader, and student hourly positions. Students should contact their program for information on how to obtain an assistantship.\nMore information can be found in the Payroll Benefits appendix.\nThe Graduate Assistant Policies and Procedures (GAPP) outline employment-related practices for graduate student teaching, research, and project assistants.\nSee Enrollment Requirements, Fellowships, Maximum Levels of Appointments, Project or Program Assistant (PA), Research Assistant (RA), Teaching Assistant (TA), Traineeships\n• Attendance\n\nMore\n\n\n\nStudents should not attend classes without being enrolled. Faculty and instructors may require enrolled students to attend scheduled meetings of a class and/or to participate in other course-related activities, including online learning. Students are responsible for materials presented in such meetings or activities. Because courses are designed and conducted in diverse ways, faculty and instructors should inform students in writing at the beginning of each course if there are specific expectations for attendance/participation, including whether any component of the grade is based on such attendance/participation.\nSee Religious and Election Day Observances Policy and Guidelines in the Academic Calendar for more information.\n• Auditing Courses\n\nMore\n\n\n\nA student auditing a course is expected to attend classes on a regular basis as an observer. Audits are not free; a course taken for audit costs the same as a course taken for credit. If students are not paying full-time fees, they will be assessed per-credit fees for an audit course. Auditors do not take examinations or submit class work. Auditors will receive a final grade of either S (Satisfactory) or NR (No Report). Audit courses do not satisfy any credit, coursework, or degree requirements, nor do they count in fulfilling minimum or maximum credits required in each term. Students holding assistantships and fellowships should be particularly aware of the enrollment requirement for their appointment, as audit requests will be denied if auditing the course would drop them below the required number of graded credits.  If students audit a course and do not attend or drop it, they will receive a grade of NR (No Report). Dissertators are not allowed to audit.  Dissertators who wish to audit a course will be removed from dissertator fee status and assessed regular graduate student fees and also will need to enroll in the appropriate number of graded credits (see enrollment requirements). Students who have research assistantship, fellowship or traineeship appointments are required to be enrolled full-time; audited courses do not count toward full-time enrollment.\nInstructors may limit the number of auditors in a course and may restrict participation of auditors in courses inappropriate for that function. For example, courses that by their nature require participation (seminars, research, laboratory, performance, or language courses) are typically considered inappropriate for auditing.  Additionally, independent study courses are not appropriate for auditing.\nTo audit a course, a student must first obtain the consent of the instructor. The student must follow the procedures established in the program offering the course. Graduate School Dean’s approval is required for all course changes, including audit; see the Course Changes section of this document for instructions. The Dean’s signature will be fulfilled once submitted to the Graduate School. The deadline to request/cancel permission to audit is the drop deadline, which is the end of the 9th week of class during the fall and spring semester. Requests for late audits will not be considered. Specific deadline dates, including those for summer sessions, are posted prior to each semester by the Office of the Registrar.\nThe enrollment system counts all credits in determining maximum credit loads. A Credit Overload Request from is required if a student’s total credit load exceeds the maximum limit per term.\nSee Authorization for Courses, Course Changes, Credit Changes, Dean’s Approval, Dissertator Status, Enrollment Requirements, Overloads, Refunds\n• Authorization for Courses\n\nMore\n\n\n\nEnrollment authorization may be required for certain courses and/or situations, such as:\n\nauditing courses\npermission to take a course when a student does not meet course controls or prerequisites, or\npermission to enroll in a closed course\n\nOnce authorized by the program offering the course, students then may enroll in the course.\nSee Add/Drop, Auditing Courses, Credit Changes, Pass/Fail\n• auditing courses\n• permission to take a course when a student does not meet course controls or prerequisites, or\n• permission to enroll in a closed course\n• Benefits\n\nMore\n\n\n\nProject/Program Assistants (PAs), Research Assistants (RAs), and Teaching Assistants (TAs), fellows, and trainees who hold at least a 33% appointment (or an equivalent) may be eligible for health insurance, vacation, sick leave, and remission of tuition. Students should contact their department/program staff benefits coordinator for details.\nGraduate students enrolled in service-based pricing programs, such as online and accelerated programs, are ineligible to receive tuition remission. See a list of UW–Madison academic programs with service-based pricing (NetID login required).\nSee Enrollment Requirements, Insurance and Medical Benefits, Tuition Remission, Payroll Benefits\n• Breadth Requirements in Doctoral Education\n\nMore\n\n\n\nBreadth is a required component of doctoral training at UW–Madison. Given there are multiple paths to breadth, the Graduate School leaves the choice of whether students achieve breadth through a minor or other means up to the specific program.\nSee Minors\n• Canceling Enrollment\n\nMore\n\n\n\nBefore the first day of classes (Canceling Enrollment)\nIf students do not wish to attend a semester and drop all courses before the first day of classes, they officially cancel their enrollment, owe no tuition or fees for that term, and have no semester entry on their transcript. In this case, it is not necessary for the student to submit a withdrawal request through MyUW.\nOn or after the first day of classes (Withdrawing)\nOn or after the first day of class, students who no longer wish to remain enrolled need to submit an electronic withdrawal request via MyUW Student Center. More information about canceling enrollment or withdrawal requests can be found on the Registrar’s website.\nSee Withdrawal\n• Capstone Certificates\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe university offers capstone certificates for students not currently enrolled in a UW–Madison graduate degree program. Applicants must have completed a baccalaureate degree or equivalent credential from an accredited college or university. The capstone certificate is designed to ‘cap off’ undergraduate experience or to offer a focused professionally oriented experience. Capstone programs do not lead to the conferral of a graduate degree. Further information about capstone certificates can be found on the Professional Degrees & Certificates website.\nSee Graduate/Professional Certificates, Specialist Certificates\n• Certificate of Doctoral Candidacy\n\nMore\n\n\n\nDissertators who do not plan on finishing their degree may request a Certificate of Doctoral Candidacy in recognition of their completion of all requirements toward the doctoral degree except for the dissertation (sometimes called all but dissertation/ABD at other institutions). The certificate shows the date of the preliminary examination as well as the issue date, but does not substitute for an official transcript from the Office of the Registrar. To obtain the certificate, students, advisors, or graduate coordinators should contact the Graduate School Degree Coordinator.\nSee Dissertator Status\n• Certification of Enrollment Status\n\nMore\n\n\n\nFor purposes of certification to government or private agencies, the Office of the Registrar determines enrollment status as full-time or part-time according to institutional policies, which may differ from full-time or part-time requirements imposed by individual schools or programs. Certification of official enrollment for loan deferment, medical and auto insurance forms, and credit card applications can be obtained by going to the Office of the Registrar’s verifications webpage.\nVeterans Certification: Student Veterans who are eligible for Federal and State Educational Benefits should apply for certification of enrollment at University Veteran Services. Students receiving veterans’ benefits are required to promptly report any credit change or withdrawal from school to University Veteran Services.\nSee Enrollment Requirements\n• Certification of Graduation (or ‘Degree Completion Letter’)\n\nMore\n\n\n\nIf you have completed all degree requirements and deposited your thesis or dissertation and are waiting until the next degree conferral date to receive your degree, you may request from the Office of the Registrar a Degree Completion Letter (Degree Verification) indicating that all requirements have been completed. Important: All grades from the semester in which you are depositing your dissertation (and all other outstanding grades) must be reported before you can receive a completion letter.\nSince master’s and doctoral degrees do not appear on transcripts until 4 to 6 weeks after the end of a semester, students may wish to obtain this letter from the Registrar’s Office to provide to employers or other universities to verify degree completion before the transcript posting, but after all grades are finalized and their dissertation (doctoral degree) or thesis (if required for the master’s degree) is approved and deposited.\nSee Degree Conferral/Payroll End Dates, Holds\n• Change of Degree Level (Plan) or Degree Named Option (Sub-Major)\n\nMore\n\n\n\nDegree Level (Plan)\nA student may change their degree level, for example, if students with a master’s degree plan have completed their master’s degree and want to continue in the same program for the doctoral degree. To change degree level, see Applying to Add/Change Program, Plan, or Named Option.\nNamed Option (Sub-Major)\nA named option is a formally documented sub-major within an academic major program. Named options appear on the transcript with degree conferral. The Graduate Faculty Executive Committee approves official named options. Many programs may also have unofficial specializations, concentrations, or tracks; unlike named options these do not appear on the transcript. Find more information on named options. To report a change in degree named option, see Applying to Add/Change Program, Plan, or Named Option.\nFor questions, please contact the Graduate School Degree Coordinator.\nSee Applying to Add/Change Program, Plan, or Named Option, Programs (or ‘Majors’)\n• Committees (Doctoral/Master’s/MFA)\n\nMore\n\n\n\nCommittees advise and evaluate satisfactory progress, administer preliminary and final oral examinations, evaluate a thesis or dissertation, and/or sign a degree warrant. A student’s program arranges a committee with appropriate expertise to afford the breadth and depth needed in degree examinations. The responsibilities of individual committee members are determined by the program. The executive committee (or its equivalent) of a program/department is responsible for approving the composition of all graduate committees. The final warrant request which includes committee membership must be submitted to the Graduate School at least three weeks before the examination date. Students should consult their advisor and their program’s student handbook for the specific function of degree committees in their program.\nUse this online tool to help you determine whether the proposed committee would meet the following criteria.\nTHE GRADUATE SCHOOL REQUIREMENTS FOR GRADUATE COMMITTEES ARE AS FOLLOWS:\nFor doctoral committees/final oral examination committees:\n1. The chair or one of the co-chairs of the committee must be graduate faculty1 from the student’s program.  (Note:  Faculty who retire or resign retain graduate faculty status for one year and can serve as chair or a co-chair during that time.)4,5\n2. The committee must have at least four members. The committee must have members from at least two University of Wisconsin—Madison graduate programs.3,5    \n3. Three of the committee members must be UW–Madison graduate faculty or former UW–Madison graduate faculty up to one year after resignation or retirement.\n4. At least three committee members must be designated as readers.6\n5. The fourth member and any additional members may be from any of the following categories, as approved by the program executive committee (or its equivalent): graduate faculty, faculty from a department without a graduate program1, academic staff2 (including emeritus faculty), visiting faculty, faculty from other institutions, scientists, research associates, and other individuals deemed qualified by the executive committee (or its equivalent).\n6. All committee members have voting rights. To receive a doctoral degree, students cannot receive more than one dissenting vote from their committee on the final degree warrant.\nFor MFA final committees:\n1. The chair or one of the co-chairs of the committee must be graduate faculty1 from the student’s program.  (Note:  Faculty who retire or resign retain graduate faculty status for one year and can serve as chair or a co-chair during that time.)4,5\n2. The committee must have at least four members.\n3. Three of the committee members must be UW–Madison graduate faculty or former UW–Madison graduate faculty up to one year after resignation or retirement.\n4. The fourth member and any additional members may be from any of the following categories, as approved by the program executive committee (or its equivalent): graduate faculty, faculty from a department without a graduate program1, academic staff2 (including emeritus faculty), visiting faculty, faculty from other institutions, scientists, research associates, and other individuals deemed qualified by the executive committee (or its equivalent).\n5. All committee members have voting rights. To receive a MFA degree, students cannot receive more than one dissenting vote from their committee on the final degree warrant.\nFor master’s thesis committees:\n1. The chair or one of the co-chairs of the committee must be graduate faculty1 from the student’s program.  (Note:  Faculty who retire or resign retain graduate faculty status for one year and can serve as chair or a co-chair during that time.)3,5\n2. The committee must have at least three members.\n3. Two of the committee members must be UW–Madison graduate faculty or former UW–Madison graduate faculty up to one year after resignation or retirement.\n4. The third member and any additional members may be from any of the following categories, as approved by the program executive committee (or its equivalent): graduate faculty, faculty from a department without a graduate program1, academic staff2 (including emeritus faculty), visiting faculty, faculty from other institutions, scientists, research associates, and other individuals deemed qualified by the executive committee (or its equivalent).\n5. All committee members have voting rights. To receive a master’s degree, students cannot receive more than one dissenting vote from their committee on the final degree warrant.\nFor master’s non-thesis committees:\n1. The committees must have at least one graduate faculty1 from the student’s program.3,5\n2. To receive a master’s degree, students cannot receive more than one dissenting vote from their committee on the final degree warrant.\nFootnotes:\n1 Graduate Faculty: The UW–Madison Faculty Policies and Procedures 3.05 contains the policies and exceptions regarding the graduate faculty status.\n2 Academic Staff: The UW–Madison Faculty Policies and Procedures 3.05H contains the policy related to academic staff serving on the committees.\n3 Program: Programs are officially approved courses of study and research leading to a master’s or doctoral degree. They may be administered from within a disciplinary department or across departments by an interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary cluster of faculty. Some programs have official areas of concentration within them (called named options or subplans) at the master’s and/or doctoral levels. Both programs and named options appear on the student’s transcript. Some programs have unofficial tracks, specializations, or concentrations, but these are not listed on the transcript. Contact the program’s graduate coordinator for more information.\n4 The advisor does not have to be chair of the committee, although it is often the case. Moreover, the co-advisors/co-chairs will be designated in the dissertation document.\n5 Note that affiliate appointments may be used to satisfy this requirement.\n6 Readers: Committee members who commit themselves to closely reading and reviewing the entire dissertation. The rationale for specifically designating non-reader status is to facilitate faculty participation in dissertations without automatically expecting the level of commitment associated with deeply engaging a PhD thesis. Given faculty workloads, designating a non-reader in some cases may permit faculty participation where engagement would otherwise be impossible. As long as the Graduate School minimum of at least three committee members that are readers is upheld, programs will remain in compliance with Graduate School policy. Programs may choose to have stricter requirements.\nSee Advisor\n• Compassionate Tuition Adjustment\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe Graduate School supports the principles of a compassionate tuition adjustment to accommodate students who withdraw in the following circumstance:\n\nThe students have experienced an unexpected life circumstance and/or traumatic event for which they have little or no control, and\nIt appears that the event will impede/prevent the students from successfully completing the semester.\n\nThe dean or the dean’s designee will assess the meaning and effect of the event on the student and the request for tuition adjustment. Students requesting a tuition adjustment should submit their request in writing to Academic Services in the Graduate School, along with written support for the request from the student’s faculty advisor and/or graduate program chair. Relevant documentation may be required.\nSee Dean’s Approval\n• The students have experienced an unexpected life circumstance and/or traumatic event for which they have little or no control, and\n• It appears that the event will impede/prevent the students from successfully completing the semester.\n• Concurrent Appointments for Fellows/Trainees\n\nMore\n\n\n\nConcurrent appointments describes a situation where a graduate student holds multiple appointments as a fellow, trainee, and/or graduate assistant. Federal agencies and non-federal donors often place restrictions on the amount of work in which an awardee may engage, or on additional stipends an awardee may receive. In addition, the university has a concurrent appointment policy that places limits on multiple appointments for fellows or trainees.\nWhenever assistantships (RA, TA, or PA) are combined with fellowships or traineeships, total compensation cannot exceed the department’s full-time RA rate that was reported to the Graduate School for the current year (fellowship/traineeship + assistantship = total compensation). The list of approved program rates can be found on the Graduate Assistantships webpage, under “Assistantship stipends by program”.\nThe concurrent appointment policy for fellows/trainees can be found here in the University of Wisconsin-Madison Policy for Supplementation and Concurrent Appointments for Graduate Students Holding Predoctoral Fellowships or Traineeships.\nSee Maximum Levels of Appointments\n• Continuous Enrollment Requirement for Dissertators\n\nMore\n\n\n\nOnce students achieve dissertator status they must maintain continuous enrollment until completion of the doctoral degree. In order to maintain continuous enrollment, dissertators must enroll each fall and spring semester for 3 credits (300 or above) directly related to their dissertation research (generally research and thesis and/or required seminars). In some cases, the 3 credits can be a combination of research and a seminar. Fall and spring enrollment are required whether or not they reside in Madison.\nAudits and pass/fail do not satisfy this requirement. Additional courses taken audit or pass/fail will result in removal of dissertator fee status.\nStudents are exempt from the requirement to enroll for the summer term, unless they are defending and/or depositing their dissertation or have a Research Assistantship (RA), fellowship, or traineeship that requires summer enrollment, or are using university facilities (including faculty and staff time).\nIf dissertators do not maintain continuous enrollment, they will be assessed a degree completion fee equal to 12 times the current per-credit rate in effect at the time that they submit their dissertation to the Graduate School for final review.\nSee Degree Completion Fee, Dissertator Status, Enrollment Requirements, Readmission to Graduate School (for previously enrolled graduate students)\n• Course Changes\n\nMore\n\n\n\nPrior to making changes to courses, be sure to review the Office of the Registrar’s Enrollment Deadlines Page for important dates and deadlines, and the Graduate School’s Enrollment Requirements including important information about minimum credits required.\nPrior to deadlines, students may make course changes online via MyUW Student Center. See the Late Enrollment/Late Course Change/Late Drop document for changing enrollment after the deadlines.\nIf a course change is made after the fee refund deadlines (including audited, modular, and zero-credit courses) students may owe additional money, even if the total number of credits for which they are enrolled does not change. The Bursar’s Office will notify students if they owe additional fees or are entitled to a refund.\nStudents holding graduate assistantships, fellowships, and traineeships must meet minimum enrollment requirements when making course changes.\nInternational students considering a course change that may drop them to part-time status must first receive authorization from International Student Services (ISS). This will ensure that they remain in compliance with Department of Homeland Security (DHS) visa regulations. International students holding graduate assistantships, fellowships, and traineeships must meet minimum enrollment requirements as well.\nFor more information and questions, contact the Office of the Registrar or Graduate School Academic Services. The Registrar’s Office also offers demos and tutorials for course enrollment. For instructions on how to late add/change/drop a class, visit the Late Enrollment/Late Course Change/Late Drop document.\nSee Add/Drop, Auditing Courses, Authorization for Courses, Credit Changes, Enrollment Requirements, Late Enrollment/Late Course Change/Late Drop, Section Changes, Tuition and Fee Information\n• Course Numbering System\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe number assigned to a course gives an indication of for whom the course is intended. While graduate students can enroll in courses numbered under 300, those courses do not count for any credits toward a graduate degree or for minimum enrollment requirements.\nThe Minimum Graduate Coursework Policy requires at least 50% of a graduate degree coursework be taken with courses that have the graduate level course attribute. See the Course Attributes Policy for specific information on courses that meet this requirement.\nSee also Continuous Enrollment Requirement, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Prior Coursework\n• Credit Changes\n\nMore\n\n\n\nStudents are not allowed to enroll for more or fewer credits than indicated for a course in the Schedule of Classes.\nFor more information and questions, contact the Office of the Registrar or Graduate School Office of Academic Services. Demos & Tutorials for course changes are available here. For instructions on how to late add/change/drop a class, visit the Late Enrollment/Late Course Change/Late Drop section.\nSee Auditing Courses, Course Changes, Dean’s Approval, Late Enrollment/Late Course Change/Late Drop, Pass/Fail, Variable Credit Courses, Tuition and Fee Information\n• Credit/No Credit Grades\n\nMore\n\n\n\nCourses that have been designated in the Schedule of Classes as credit/no credit are entered on transcripts as either CR, if students earned credits for which the course was offered, or N, if students did not earn any credit, even though they were enrolled for the course. Any course numbered 300 or above that is taken for credit/no credit will count toward the Graduate School’s minimum graduate degree credit requirement and the minimum graduate residence credit requirement (including 300-level courses in English as a Second Language). Visit the Office of the Registrar’s Valid Grades webpage for more information.\n• Deadlines\n\nMore\n\n\n\nStudents are responsible for learning about and complying with campus deadlines. Failure to meet deadlines for enrollment, payment of fees, changing courses or credits, and receiving a degree can cost time, money, or both. The Office of the Registrar’s Enrollment Deadlines page lists enrollment, fee payment, and course change deadlines. Visit the Graduate School’s Degree Deadlines page for more information about the deadlines for achieving dissertator status or receiving a degree in any given semester.\nGraduate students should note that Graduate School deadlines do not necessarily correspond to undergraduate enrollment deadlines. Refer to the Office of the Registrar’s Enrollment Deadlines for detailed and specific enrollment and refund deadlines and dates.\nSee Add/Drop, Course Changes, Pass/Fail, Withdrawal\n• Dean’s Approval\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe Graduate School acts as the academic dean’s office for all graduate students. If a student needs a dean’s approval or authorization, they should contact the Graduate School Office of Academic Services at gsacserv@grad.wisc.edu.\n• Degree Completion Fee\n\nMore\n\n\n\nFor master’s students\nIn lieu of enrollment, the Graduate School may approve payment of a degree completion fee for a master’s degree candidate who has completed all of the degree requirements except thesis defense, comprehensive examination(s), presentation of a final project, or removal of an incomplete grade. To be eligible students must have submitted their final thesis or project paper to their advisor while they were enrolled. This fee is comparable to 2 graduate credits at the current resident tuition rate. This fee is established annually and assessed per semester. Students should ask their program to submit a Degree Completion Fee Request Form to the Graduate School on their behalf before the beginning of the semester when students are completing a master’s degree. After the Graduate School approves the request, the fee will be added to the student’s account. Students must pay the completion fee before the program requests a warrant.\nFor dissertators\nThe Graduate School requires all dissertators to maintain continuous enrollment (see the continuous enrollment policy for dissertators). Dissertators must enroll in the semester(s) in which they defend, submit their dissertations, and graduate (see enrollment requirements for dissertators). In rare circumstances where this is not possible, a degree completion fee is assessed to recognize the inevitable use of university facilities (including faculty and staff time) up to and including the successful defense and submission of the dissertation. The fee is equal to 12 times the current per-credit dissertator rate in effect at the time the dissertation is submitted. The fee is assessed at the time dissertators are ready to complete the degree and is based on the resident or nonresident tuition status dissertators had at their last term of enrollment. If dissertators break enrollment and then reenter and enroll for less than 4 continuous terms before completion, they will pay a prorated rate (the 12-credit fee minus all continuous enrollment credits paid since the time of readmission). If enrollment is broken, but a dissertator reenters and enrolls for at least 4 continuous terms, then a completion fee is not assessed. Students must pay the completion fee before the program requests a warrant\nSee Continuous Enrollment Requirement for Dissertators, Enrollment Requirements\n• Degree Conferral/Payroll End Dates\n\nMore\n\n\n\nGraduate students who complete all degree requirements at any point during a term remain officially enrolled and retain student status through the official degree conferral date for that term, as determined by the Secretary of the Faculty and posted as conferral date on the transcript. Degrees are granted three times per year in May, August, and December. The official conferral date can be found on the Office of the Registrar’s Dates & Deadlines webpage.\nFunding for graduating students\nGraduate assistants, fellows, and trainees may remain on the payroll until the end of the term, as stated above, or may be removed if necessary for a change of status (e.g. to a postdoc or academic staff position) or end of grant funding. If a student is removed, the Bursar’s Office will check with the Graduate School to confirm graduation at the end of the given term and will maintain tuition remission for appropriately funded students if the student remains on payroll through the dates listed below:\n\nDoctoral candidates: through the date of dissertation deposit or through the official conferral date of term\nNon-thesis master’s candidates: through the completion date stated on warrant or through the official conferral date of term\nThesis master’s candidates: through the date thesis is received by the Memorial Library or through the official conferral date of term\n\nInternational students: contact International Student Services for guidance on the degree completion date and its impact on the visa status. The dates listed above may be different for international students.\nWindow Period degrees\nThe “Window Period” is the time between the end of one degree period and the beginning of the next. Students are eligible to complete their degree requirements during the window period if they were registered for the previous semester (fall, spring, or summer). If all degree requirements are met by the end of the window period, a student’s degree will be granted for the following semester. Students will not have to register or pay fees for the next semester.\nStudents receiving window period degrees may remain on payroll and retain student status only through the dates listed below:\n\nDoctoral candidates: through the date of dissertation deposit or through the last day of the window period\nNon-thesis master’s candidates: through the completion date stated on warrant\nThesis master’s candidates: through the date thesis is received by the Memorial Library\n\nInternational students: contact International Student Services for guidance on the degree completion date and its impact on the visa status. The dates listed above may be different for international students.\nSee Certification of Graduation (or ‘Degree Completion Letter’), Graduation\n• Doctoral candidates: through the date of dissertation deposit or through the official conferral date of term\n• Non-thesis master’s candidates: through the completion date stated on warrant or through the official conferral date of term\n• Thesis master’s candidates: through the date thesis is received by the Memorial Library or through the official conferral date of term\n• Doctoral candidates: through the date of dissertation deposit or through the last day of the window period\n• Non-thesis master’s candidates: through the completion date stated on warrant\n• Thesis master’s candidates: through the date thesis is received by the Memorial Library\n• Degree Summary\n\nMore\n\n\n\nA computerized graduate degree summary is not prepared for graduate students (e.g. the Degree Audit Reporting System, or DARS). Students’ programs, particularly their advisors, are responsible for ensuring timely fulfillment of Graduate School and program requirements. Students should consult their program’s satisfactory progress criteria in their program’s student handbook, or in the Graduate Guide.\nStudents and programs can check academic progress using the Graduate Student Tracking System.\nSee Advisor, Satisfactory Progress\n• Disability Accommodations\n\nMore\n\n\n\nStudents with disabilities are encouraged to inform their faculty advisor and instructor of their need for disability-related accommodations in a timely manner. Implementation of reasonable accommodations is a shared faculty and student responsibility. Faculty, either directly or in coordination with the McBurney Disability Resource Center, are expected to work with students to identify and provide reasonable accommodations.\nThe McBurney Disability Resource Center provides disability-related services and accommodations to undergraduate, graduate, professional, special and guest students. The Center works closely with students and faculty on the provision of reasonable accommodations to ensure access to the learning environment. The Center makes referrals to other campus offices or community resources for non-classroom accommodations such as housing, transportation, personal care attendants, etc. Students should contact the Center upon admission to begin the eligibility for services process. Early notice is essential in order to have services and accommodations in place prior to the start of the semester.\nMcBurney Disability Resource Center\n702 West Johnson Street, Suite 2104\n608/263-2741 (voice)\n608/225-7956 (text)\nmcburney@studentlife.wisc.edu\nSee Discrimination\n• Discrimination\n\nMore\n\n\n\nIn conformance with applicable federal and state law and with university policy, UW–Madison does not discriminate on the basis of age, ancestry, color, creed, disability, ethnicity, marital or parental status, national origin, pregnancy, race, religion, disability, retaliation for making a complaint of discrimination or taking part in an investigation relating to discrimination, sex, sexual orientation, or veteran’s status with regard to treatment of students in the educational programs or activities that the university operates.\nShould students wish to speak to someone about discrimination or harassment protected by federal or state laws or campus policies, they should contact the Office of Compliance or the Office of Student Assistance and Support.\n• Dissertation Standards and Publishing\n\nMore\n\n\n\nA doctoral dissertation must be a dissertator’s own work. If it is the result of research enterprises in which others have collaborated, a substantial portion must represent the dissertator’s own contribution and the other research participants must be identified.\nEffective September 1, 2017, dissertations must acknowledge contributions received from other individuals, including co-authors of published work that appears in the document, such as in designing the research, executing the research, analyzing the data, interpreting the data/research, or writing, proofing, or copyediting the manuscript.\nPublication of the doctoral dissertation is required. The university uses ProQuest UMI ETD Administrator to publish the dissertation electronically and on microfilm and to publish an abstract of the dissertation in Dissertation Abstracts, a monthly publication. Dissertators must pay the cost of processing the dissertation and publishing the abstract by ProQuest.\nAll doctoral dissertations are reviewed by the Graduate School’s Office of Academic Services. More information can be found on the Graduate School’s Completing Your Degree webpage.\nMost master’s theses at UW–Madison are not published through ProQuest, although a student may choose to do so. If students want to publish their master’s thesis through ProQuest, they should contact the Graduate School’s Office of Academic Services.\nSee Copyright, Deadlines\n• Dissertator Status\n\nMore\n\n\n\nDissertator is a unique fee status for students who have completed all requirements for a doctoral degree except for the dissertation. To be eligible for dissertator fee status, a student must:\n\nPass the preliminary examination(s);\nSatisfy the doctoral minimum graduate residence credit requirement;\nComplete all minor requirements, if the major program requires a minor;\nComplete all program requirements except the dissertation;\nClear all Incomplete grades or Progress grades in non-research courses (progress grades in 990 research may remain);\nEarn at least a 3.0 cumulative graduate GPA;\nReturn the signed and dated preliminary exam warrant to the Graduate School.\n\nDissertator status is effective at the start of the semester following completion of all dissertator requirements for the doctoral degree except for the dissertation. In order to initiate the change to dissertator status, the prelim warrant must be sent to the Graduate School in a timely fashion. Students can check on dissertator status by contacting their graduate program coordinator. All dissertator requirements must be met before the first day of classes to be a dissertator for any given semester. If all dissertator requirements are completed before the first day of classes but the signed prelim warrant does not reach the Graduate School by that deadline, the student can still become a dissertator that semester. Submit the warrant to the Graduate School as soon as possible and enroll for at least 3 credits (usually 990 research) for that semester. Removal of Dissertator Status: A dissertator who enrolls for more (or fewer) than 3 credits will be removed from dissertator status for the fall or spring term in which the enrollment is not exactly 3 credits. During the summer, however, an enrolled dissertator may ask their advisor to request an overload of 1-2 additional credits in a short session and still retain dissertator fee status, if the course is related to dissertation research or professional training that is not offered in regular semesters. The removal of dissertator status may have the following consequences:\n\nGraduate assistant (TA/PA/RA) stipend rates may have to be adjusted to the non-dissertator rate, or percent limitations\nFees are assessed at the non-dissertator rate\nFull-time status may change to part-time, possibly affecting loan deferral, visa status, etc.\n\nIf a dissertator wants to pursue a graduate degree or certificate in another area, the dissertator fee status will be discontinued and regular graduate fees will be assessed, with possible consequences listed above. Find more information about the tuition and fees for a dissertator and non-dissertator on the Bursar’s Office Tuition and Fees webpage.\nSee Addition/Change of Program, Plan, or Named Option, Enrollment Requirements, Maximum Levels of Appointments, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement\n• Pass the preliminary examination(s);\n• Satisfy the doctoral minimum graduate residence credit requirement;\n• Complete all minor requirements, if the major program requires a minor;\n• Complete all program requirements except the dissertation;\n• Clear all Incomplete grades or Progress grades in non-research courses (progress grades in 990 research may remain);\n• Earn at least a 3.0 cumulative graduate GPA;\n• Return the signed and dated preliminary exam warrant to the Graduate School.\n• Graduate assistant (TA/PA/RA) stipend rates may have to be adjusted to the non-dissertator rate, or percent limitations\n• Fees are assessed at the non-dissertator rate\n• Full-time status may change to part-time, possibly affecting loan deferral, visa status, etc.\n• Doctoral Minors\n\nMore\n\n\n\nBreadth is a required component of doctoral training at UW–Madison. Given there are multiple paths to breadth, the Graduate School leaves the choice of whether students achieve breadth through a doctoral minor (two options as described below), Graduate/Professional certificate, or other means up to the specific graduate program.  The specific Breadth Requirement Policy, including information on certificates, is found here: https://policy.wisc.edu/library/UW-1200\nMinor options are as follows:\nOption A (external doctoral minor): Requires a minimum of 9 credits in a doctoral minor program (single disciplinary or multi-disciplinary). Fulfillment of this option requires the approval of the doctoral minor program.\nOption B (distributed doctoral minor): Requires a minimum of 9 credits in one or more programs forming a coherent topic.  Fulfillment of this option requires the approval of the doctoral major program.\nThe Graduate School’s minimum course requirements for the doctoral minor include:\n\nAn average GPA of 3.00 on all minor coursework;\nCoursework must be graded courses numbered 300 or above; no audits or pass/fail;\nMaximum 3 credits of independent study (e.g., 699, 799, 899, 999);\nResearch and thesis cannot be used to satisfy the minor (e.g., 790, 890, 990);\nNo more than 5 credits of coursework completed more than 5 years prior to admission to the doctoral program; coursework taken 10 years ago or more may not be used.\n\nA student cannot earn a doctoral minor and a Graduate/Professional certificate of the same name. Credits earned towards the doctoral minor may count towards the minimum graduate residence requirement, minimum graduate degree requirement, and the minimum graduate coursework (50%) requirement.\nSee Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Prior Coursework\n• An average GPA of 3.00 on all minor coursework;\n• Coursework must be graded courses numbered 300 or above; no audits or pass/fail;\n• Maximum 3 credits of independent study (e.g., 699, 799, 899, 999);\n• Research and thesis cannot be used to satisfy the minor (e.g., 790, 890, 990);\n• No more than 5 credits of coursework completed more than 5 years prior to admission to the doctoral program; coursework taken 10 years ago or more may not be used.\n• Double Degrees\n\nMore\n\n\n\nDouble degrees are two same-level (master’s or doctoral) degrees from two separate graduate programs. Students completing a double degree earn two degrees (two programs), and receive two diplomas. Double degree candidates have two advisors and two separate committees, and they complete two theses (master’s) or dissertations (doctoral).\nStudents may apply for an additional program at the time of original application, add a program at any time during their enrollment, or reapply and pursue a second degree after completion of the first.  Students should inquire with each program prior to enrollment to see if additional policies exist that would restrict the ability to complete a double degree.\nIn all scenarios, regardless of whether double degree programs are completed consecutively or concurrently, students must:\n\nBe admitted to both programs;\nFulfill the Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence, degree, and coursework credit requirements for each degree;\nComplete the specific degree requirements for each program, including minimum graduate degree, residence, and coursework (50%) credit requirements for each;\nHave no more than a 25% credit overlap between degrees, based on the lower credit requirements of the two programs;\nHave an advisor from each program and both advisors must be informed of each other.\n\nApproval of the double degree: at the time of graduation, each program must submit to the Graduate School a list of the courses being used to satisfy that program’s requirements. Both advisors must sign the course lists as indication of approval. The Graduate School will review the course lists for credit overlap between degrees.\nDoctoral students who add a master’s degree program outside the doctoral program cannot be dissertators.\nInternational students must contact International Student Services before adding a second degree program.\nSee Addition/Change of Program, Plan, or Named Option, Change of Degree Level (Plan), International Students Maintaining Legal Status, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Appendix 5 – Double, Joint, and Dual Degrees at a Glance\n• Be admitted to both programs;\n• Fulfill the Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence, degree, and coursework credit requirements for each degree;\n• Complete the specific degree requirements for each program, including minimum graduate degree, residence, and coursework (50%) credit requirements for each;\n• Have no more than a 25% credit overlap between degrees, based on the lower credit requirements of the two programs;\n• Have an advisor from each program and both advisors must be informed of each other.\n• Double, Joint, and Dual Degrees Comparison\n\nMore\n\n\n\nDouble Degree\n\n2 degrees, 2 diplomas\n2 graduate majors\n2 advisors, 2 committees\n2 theses or dissertations\nMinimum Graduate School requirements for each degree\n2 prelims (PhD)\n2 warrant requests, 2 warrants\nList of courses used for each major must be submitted to GS when requesting warrants.\nNo more than 25% overlap (of the total credits for the program with lowest credit requirement).\n\nJoint Degree\n\n1 degree, 1 diploma\n2 graduate majors\n2 advisors, 1 committee\n1 thesis or dissertation\nJoint prelim, if both major programs agree, or 2 prelims (PhD)\n1 warrant request, 1 warrant\nMust submit proposal to GS before beginning of second year.  Need signatures of both advisors and both program directors, and Graduate School approval.\n\nDual Degree\n\nOne graduate degree and one professional degree (i.e. a degree from the School of Medicine and Public Health or the Law school).\n• 2 degrees, 2 diplomas\n• 2 graduate majors\n• 2 advisors, 2 committees\n• 2 theses or dissertations\n• Minimum Graduate School requirements for each degree\n• 2 prelims (PhD)\n• 2 warrant requests, 2 warrants\n• List of courses used for each major must be submitted to GS when requesting warrants.\n• No more than 25% overlap (of the total credits for the program with lowest credit requirement).\n• 1 degree, 1 diploma\n• 2 graduate majors\n• 2 advisors, 1 committee\n• 1 thesis or dissertation\n• Joint prelim, if both major programs agree, or 2 prelims (PhD)\n• 1 warrant request, 1 warrant\n• Must submit proposal to GS before beginning of second year.  Need signatures of both advisors and both program directors, and Graduate School approval.\n• One graduate degree and one professional degree (i.e. a degree from the School of Medicine and Public Health or the Law school).\n• Dual Degrees: Graduate and Professional Combination\n\nMore\n\n\n\nA dual degree is two degrees, one of which is granted in a graduate program, and the other in a professional school (e.g., MD, JD, DVM, DPharm, MPH). Students must inquire with each program prior to enrollment to see if additional policies exist that would restrict the ability to complete a dual degree.\nTo receive a dual degree students must:\n\nBe admitted to both programs;\nComplete the specific degree requirements for the Graduate School and the professional school;\nFulfill the Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence, degree, and coursework (50%) credit requirements for the graduate degree.\n\nTuition is determined by a combined fee schedule table. Assessed fees are roughly halfway between graduate fees and professional fees. Credit limits each semester coincide with the professional schools’ higher credit maximums. Find more information about the tuition and fees on the Bursar’s Office Tuition and Fees webpage.\nSee Addition/Change of Program, Plan, or Named Option, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Appendix 5 – Double, Joint, and Dual Degrees at a Glance\n• Be admitted to both programs;\n• Complete the specific degree requirements for the Graduate School and the professional school;\n• Fulfill the Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence, degree, and coursework (50%) credit requirements for the graduate degree.\n• Effective Date of Program Requirements upon Enrollment\n\nMore\n\n\n\nAny student entering or readmitted to a graduate program must adhere to the requirements in the most current Academic Policies & Procedures and Graduate Guide. This includes all new incoming students, those students continuing from a master’s degree to a doctoral degree, add/change program students, degree completion fee students, and any readmitted students. A student who chooses to discontinue their degree program for a semester or more would return under the requirements in the most recent Academic Policies & Procedures.\nStudents enrolled prior to fall 2014 in a MFA, specialist certificate, or doctoral degree program have the option to complete their degree under the prior policy requirements if they maintain continuous enrollment.\nA student who advances from the master’s level to the doctoral level fall 2014 or after is subject to the requirements in the most current Academic Policies & Procedures.\nAppeals will be considered in exceptional cases. The request for appeal must be made on a student-by-student basis. The appeal should come from the students faculty advisor and/or program chair and be sent to the Graduate School Director of Academic Services. The appeal should include sufficient justification for the request and any supporting documentation.\nSee Continuous Enrollment Requirement\n• Enrollment\n\nMore\n\n\n\nCourse enrollment is available through MyUW in the Course Search and Enroll App or the Student Center. Once enrolled, students should confirm that they are enrolled in the appropriate number of graduate-level graded courses. Students should enroll early to avoid a late initial enrollment fee and class cancellation due to low enrollment. Visit the Office of the Registrar’s website for more information about enrollment deadlines.\nSee Enrollment Requirements\n• Enrollment Accountability\n\nMore\n\n\n\nStudents are responsible for the accuracy of their enrollment/class schedule and for all tuition, fees, and academic consequences that result from that schedule. Continuing students in good standing may enroll for the next term without special permission from the Graduate School. Before enrolling, students should consult their advisor to approve their class schedule for that term and to determine if they need authorization for any proposed courses. Note that graduate students may not enroll in Honors credits, as those are for undergraduate students only.\nAll students must use the online enrollment system. Instructions on how to enroll using MyUW along with additional enrollment information is available through the Office of the Registrar’s website. The Office of the Registrar also provides enrollment demos and tutorials. All students will receive an email message from the Office of the Registrar about their assigned enrollment appointment time. Students can expect to receive this notification about one week prior to the beginning of the priority enrollment period. There are extra fees for late initial enrollment and late fee payment. These deadlines are available at the Office of the Registrar’s Enrollment Deadlines webpage.\nSee Enrollment, Enrollment Requirements, Holds, Late Enrollment/Late Course Change/Late Drop, Overloads, Readmission to Graduate School (for previously enrolled graduate students), Schedule of Classes\n• Enrollment Confirmation\n\nMore\n\n\n\nStudents can confirm their current enrollment status through MyUW.\nFailure to receive a student account invoice does not relieve students of the obligation to meet established fee payment deadlines as displayed in the MyUW Student Center, Class Search. If a student does not receive an invoice by late August (mid-January for spring semester), they can get a copy at the Bursar’s Office.\n• Enrollment Requirements\n\nMore\n\n\n\nALL of the following credit requirements (except F-1 and J-1 visa requirements) must be satisfied by graded courses taken at 300 or above; courses numbered below 300, audit, and pass/fail do not satisfy enrollment requirements.\nFull-time enrollment: The Graduate School considers full-time enrollment to be 8-15 graded credits* taken at 300 or above, excluding pass/fail and audit, during the fall and spring semesters, and 4-12 credits* during the summer term. Dissertators are considered full-time at 3 credits. If students elect not to enroll as full-time students as defined by the Graduate School, they are responsible for knowing about possible obligations that may require full-time status. Such obligations may include visa eligibility, fellowships, assistantships, financial aid, external funding agencies, and program satisfactory progress requirements.\nMaximum enrollment: Non-dissertator maximum credit load is 15 graded credits* taken at 300 or above during the fall and spring semester and 12 credits during the summer term. Any exceptions to the maximum credit load permitted must be obtained via the Credit Overload Request form.\nMinimum enrollment: Non-dissertator minimum credit load is 2 credits* during the fall and spring semesters. Graduate students must be enrolled in their program for at least the minimum requirement in the semester in which they receive a degree; master’s degree students expecting a summer degree must be enrolled in their program for a minimum of 2 graduate credits in any summer session*. Graduate students who do not need to maintain full-time status (including TAs and PAs) have a 2 credit enrollment minimum during fall and spring semesters. Minimum requirements must be fulfilled by courses taken for a grade (not pass/fail or audit) and must be taken at 300 or above.\nUnderload: During the fall and spring semesters, non-dissertators must enroll for a minimum of 2 credits.* Audit and pass/fail courses do not satisfy this enrollment requirement. Dissertators are required to enroll for 3 graded credits taken at 300 or above and directly related to their dissertation research.\nThe specific situations listed below have special enrollment requirements.\nDissertators: Dissertators must enroll in exactly 3 credits* directly related to their dissertation (generally research and thesis or required seminars) during fall and spring semesters. Dissertators are considered full-time at 3 credits*. Dissertators who are summer RAs, trainees or fellows, or who expect to graduate in summer, must enroll in the general 8-week summer session (DHH) for 3 credits*. Additional courses for credit, audit, or pass/fail will result in removal of dissertator status and tuition assessment at the regular graduate rate.\nOnce dissertator status has been achieved, courses other than 990 must be directly related to the dissertation research and approved by the advisor. Dissertators must enroll during the semester or general 8-week summer session (DHH) in which they expect to earn a degree. Students must be enrolled during the semester when they defend the dissertation and when they deposit the dissertation. If defending and depositing in two different semesters, the student is required to be enrolled in both semesters. Students do not have to be dissertators during the semester or summer in which they expect to earn a doctoral degree, but they must be eligible for dissertator status before they complete the doctoral degree, and they must enroll in the semester in which they will graduate.\nIf a student enrolls before the dissertator status is approved, the enrollment system may indicate they are not eligible for that course. The enrollment system does not care if students are dissertators. If students had problems getting into a course, it is probably because permission has not been entered into the enrollment system. Most individualized study courses, such as research and thesis, require instructor’s permission and online authorization before enrollment is possible.\nIf dissertator status is not processed by the segregated fee deadline, students should register for 3 credits and pay regular non-dissertator graduate fees. The fee difference will be adjusted for that semester when dissertator status is indicated in the system.\nMaster’s with thesis required: A master’s degree candidate required to submit a thesis to Memorial Library, as indicated on the degree warrant, must be enrolled in the semester in which they defend their thesis. If a student defends in a window period, they need to have been enrolled in the previous term. A student does not need to be enrolled to deposit their thesis to Memorial Library.\nAssistantship appointees: It is against university policy to hold an assistantship without being appropriately enrolled.  Assistantships include those at UW-Madison as well as any UW System institution, including UW–Extension.\nRA (Research Assistant): RAs are required to carry a full load each semester (8 to 15 credits* including research or thesis credits for non-dissertators, 3 credits* for dissertators) and at least 2 credits* during the general 8-week summer session (DHH) (3 credits* for dissertators). Dissertators who hold assistantships are considered full-time with 3 credits* directly related to their dissertation.\nTA (Teaching Assistant) and PA (Project Assistant):\nMinimum enrollment for PAs and TAs is 2 credits* (3 credits* for dissertators) during the fall and spring semesters.\n\nTo be considered full-time by the Registrar for loan deferment and for certification of student immigration status, non-dissertator PAs and TAs who hold an appointment of at least 33.33% must be enrolled for 6 credits*, or those who hold an appointment of at least 50% must be enrolled for 4 credits*.\nDissertator PAs and TAs are considered full-time with 3 credits* directly related to their dissertation (generally research and thesis or required seminars).\nMaximum enrollment for PAs and TAs is 15 credits* during the fall and spring.\nThe Graduate School has no enrollment requirement for the summer session for PAs and TAs, unless the student is receiving a summer degree, but individual programs may.\n\nFellows: Non-dissertator graduate students holding fellowships that are payrolled through the university must be enrolled full-time: 8 credits* during the fall and spring semester. Fellows who are non-dissertators with 12-month appointments must also enroll in 2 credits* during the general 8-week summer session (DHH). Those who are not payrolled as fellows over the summer are not required to be enrolled. Those who are payrolled as fellows during any part of the summer term must enroll in the general 8-week summer session (DHH). Fellows who are dissertators must enroll in 3 credits* during the fall and spring semesters. Fellows with 12-month appointments who are dissertators must also enroll in 3 credits* during the general 8-week summer session (DHH).\nTrainees: Trainees must carry a full load each fall and spring semester of 8 to 15 credits* including research or thesis credits for non-dissertators (3 credits* for dissertators), and at least 2 credits* during the general 8-week summer session (DHH) (3 credits* for dissertators).\nInternational students: Both F-1 and J-1 student visa regulations require students to be enrolled full-time each fall and spring semester (8 credits, not taken as audit). Summer enrollment is not required by the U.S. federal government regulations for F-1/J-1 visa holders. However, summer enrollment may be required due to other circumstances; see summer enrollment requirements for assistantships, fellowships, traineeships, and graduating students. Failure to maintain full-time status can result in loss of F-1/J-1 student benefits, including on-campus employment and practical/academic training options. Any exceptions to full-time enrollment must be authorized by International Student Services (ISS). Visit the ISS webpage to learn more about visa requirements. Permission from ISS to drop below full-time enrollment does NOT exempt an international student from meeting the enrollment requirement determined by a Teaching Assistantship (TA), Project Assistantship (PA), Research Assistantship (RA), fellowship, traineeship, or dissertator status.\nInternational students-online learning credit limit: F-1 and J-1 student visa holders have restrictions regarding the number of online credits that can be taken during the semester as it relates to fulfilling the full-time enrollment requirement.  There are also restrictions regarding online enrollment during the final term of study-especially when the final term for completion is in summer. For more information, visit the ISS Online Course Enrollment webpage.\nSummer enrollment requirements: Students must be enrolled at UW–Madison if they are using university facilities, including faculty and staff time.\n\nDissertators defending and/or depositing dissertation (completing their degree) in summer must enroll for 3 credits* in the general 8-week summer session (DHH).\nDissertator RAs must enroll for 3 credits* in the general 8-week summer session (DHH).\nDissertator fellows with 12-month appointments are required to enroll for 3 credits* in the general 8-week summer session (DHH).\nDissertator trainees with 12-month appointments are required to enroll for 3 credits* in the general 8-week summer session (DHH).\nMaster’s candidates, who expect to graduate in summer must enroll for at least 2 credits* in any session, short session or general 8-week summer session (DHH).\nNon-dissertators completing a summer doctoral degree must enroll for at least 2 credits* in the general 8-week summer session (DHH).\nNon-dissertator RAs must enroll for 2 credits* in the general 8-week summer session (DHH).\nNon-dissertator TAs and PAs not receiving a summer degree have no enrollment requirement. However, those who held such an appointment during the previous semester may qualify for summer tuition remission and are advised to consult with their employing department if they wish to enroll.\nNon-dissertator fellows with 12-month appointments are required to enroll for at least 2 credits* in the general 8-week summer session (DHH).\nNon-dissertator trainees are required to enroll for at least 2 credits* in the general 8-week summer session (DHH).\nInternational students who are completing a summer degree are required to enroll for at least 2 credits* in the general 8-week summer session (DHH).\nInternational students who are RAs in the summer are required to enroll for at least 2 credits* in the general 8-week summer session (DHH).\nInternational students who are not completing a summer degree and who are not RAs have no summer enrollment requirement mandated by the U.S. federal government regulations for F-1/J-1 visa holders.\n\nFinancial aid, loan deferral & taxes: In most cases, students are eligible for federal loans and federal loan payment deferral when enrolled at least half-time, which is 4 credits* for the fall and spring semesters. However, individual cases may vary, and students are advised to seek individual advice at the UW–Madison Office of Student Financial Aid. Payroll and FICA taxes can be impacted if students are not enrolled at least half-time. More information can be found here.\nFull-Time Enrollment Status at a Glance\nALL of the following credit requirements (except F-1 and J-1 visa requirements) must be satisfied by graded courses taken at 300 or above; courses numbered below 300, audit, and pass/fail do not satisfy enrollment requirements.\n\n\n\nCategories\nMinimum enrollment for full-time status: Fall or Spring\nMinimum enrollment for full-time status: Summer (general 8-week DHH session)\n\n\n\n\nDissertator\nExactly 3 credits directly related to research\nNot required unless receiving summer degree or if RA, trainee (with 12-month appointment), or fellow (with 12-month appointment), 3 cr. required.\n\n\nRA, non-dissertator\n8 cr.\n2 cr.\n\n\nTA/Lecturer (SA) 33%, non-dissertator\n6 cr.\nNot required unless receiving summer degree, 2 cr. minimum.\n\n\nTA/Lecturer (SA) 50%, non-dissertator\n4 cr.\nNot required unless receiving summer degree, 2 cr. minimum.\n\n\nPA 33%, non-dissertator\n6 cr.\nNot required unless receiving summer degree, 2 cr. minimum.\n\n\nPA 50%, non-dissertator\n4 cr.\nNot required unless receiving summer degree, 2 cr. minimum.\n\n\nFellow, non-dissertator\n8 cr.\n2 cr. for 12-month appointments.

The survey collects information on academic experiences, advising, and future plans.\nSurvey of Earned Doctorates (SED): The SED is a federally-sponsored national survey of individuals receiving research degrees from all U.S. institutions and the results are used to assess characteristics and trends in doctoral education. The SED is to be completed by PhD students, not DMA, DNP or AuD students.\nGraduate School Doctoral Exit Survey (DES): The Graduate School surveys all students graduating with a doctoral degree. The DES collects additional information on academic experiences, e.g., advising and other academic support.\nMaster’s Degree Completion Survey: All students completing master’s degrees are asked to answer a brief online survey about their plans for employment or for additional education. Students will receive an email with a link to the survey at the time of the final warrant request.\nThe doctoral exit surveys must be completed before submitting your dissertation electronically. Each individual survey will provide a certificate of completion once you have submitted the survey. The individual certificates of completion should each be saved as PDF documents to be uploaded in the administrative documents section of the ProQuest/UMI ETD Administrator website.\nDirections for completing the doctoral surveys are in the Graduate School’s Guide to Preparing your Doctoral Dissertation.\nSee Final Oral Examination (Defense)\n• Extension Courses\n\nMore\n\n\n\nA student paying full-time tuition and fees at the UW–Madison campus may ask to take courses at UW–Extension for no additional cost (if the total credit load does not exceed the maximum allowable credit load). A student’s faculty advisor must submit a completed UW–Madison Tuition Waiver Request Form, along with a letter of endorsement to the Graduate School. If the Graduate School approves, the student may take the course without paying additional fees. Courses completed at UW–Extension do not fulfill the Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence, degree, or coursework credit requirements and will not appear on the student’s UW–Madison transcript. Dissertators are not allowed to request a tuition waiver while remaining eligible for the dissertator fee status, they would need to request to be removed from dissertator status and enroll full-time and pay fees at the regular graduate student fee rate.\nSee Dissertator Status, Enrollment Requirements, Overloads\n• Failing Grades\n\nMore\n\n\n\nCourses numbered 300 and above graded F are included in the graduate GPA and do not count toward the Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence, degree, and coursework (50%) credit requirements.\nSee Grade Point Average (GPA) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Repeating Courses\n• Family Leave\n\nMore\n\n\n\nAlthough the Graduate School does not have a formal leave of absence policy for pre-dissertators, there are a number of family-friendly practices and resources for students considering taking a leave of absence for birth or adoption. Many departments and programs also have local policies. Students should consult with their program coordinator, advisor, and the Graduate School’s Office Academic Services as early as possible in their planning process.\nPlease visit the Graduate School’s Family and Parent Resources webpage for additional information.\nSee Compassionate Tuition Adjustment, Leave of Absence\n• Fellowships\n\nMore\n\n\n\nFellowships are monetary awards that students use to pursue graduate studies. In general, fellowships require no work obligations on the part of the recipient.\nCampus Fellowships: Merit-based campus and departmental fellowships are sometimes awarded to UW–Madison graduate students by their graduate programs. To inquire about eligibility and application procedures, students must contact their graduate program.\nExternal Fellowships: Many federal agencies, professional organizations, and private foundations provide fellowships for students pursuing graduate studies. Students are encouraged to look for and apply for external fellowships, and to understand the unique terms and conditions of each fellowship for which they apply. The Graduate School supports a number of federal/private fellowships through the provision of tuition support and health insurance. If students are awarded one of these fellowships, they should contact the UW–Madison Fellowship Officer at funding@grad.wisc.edu.\nInternational Fellowships: The Institute for Regional and International Studies serves as a resource center and provides information and support to faculty, students, and staff interested in identifying international research grants, scholarships, and other funding opportunities, including programs sponsored by Fulbright, National Security Education Program (Boren Scholarship), HEA (Higher Education Act), Title VI-FLAS (Foreign Languages and Area Studies), and other program competitions. Questions about funding for international research should be directed to the Institute for Regional and International Studies (IRIS).\nFor further information on fellowships, visit the Graduate School’s Funding Information webpage.\nSee Enrollment Requirements, International Students Maintaining Legal Status, Maximum Levels of Appointments, Tuition Remission, Payroll Benefits for Graduate Assistants, Fellows, and Trainees\n• Final Examination (Dissertation Defense)\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe final examination (often called “defense”) normally covers a student’s dissertation and areas of study. Students may not take the final examination until they have satisfied all other requirements for their degree. Students’ records must be cleared of incomplete grades and progress grades (other than research) before they can take the final exam.\nDoctoral students have five years from the date of passing their preliminary examinations to take their final examination and deposit their dissertation. Arrangements for the final examination and the  examination committee’s approval of the dissertation are the responsibilities of the student and the program. The graduate program coordinator must submit the final doctoral warrant request to the Graduate School at least three weeks before the final examination.\nAfter the graduate program coordinator submits the doctoral degree warrant request, the Graduate School will review this request and send the approved doctoral degree warrant to the graduate program coordinator. The final warrant should be printed out and committee member signatures should be obtained the defense. To pass the examination, students must receive no more than one dissenting vote from their committee. A missing signature is considered a dissent. Once the final warrant has been signed, an electronic copy should be uploaded in the administrative documents section of the ProQuest/UMI ETD Administrator website. The original signed hard copy of the final warrant should be kept with the student or the graduate program coordinator. For further information, visit the Graduate School’s Guide to Preparing Your Doctoral Dissertation.\nSee Preliminary Examinations, Time Limits\n• Five-Year Rule\n\nMore\n\n\n\nStudents have five years from the date of their preliminary examination to take their final oral examination and deposit their dissertation.\nSee Preliminary Examinations, Time Limits\n• Forms\n\nMore\n\n\n\nAdd/Change Program\nCredit Overload\nLate Course Add\nLate Course Drop\nLate Initial Enrollment\nDegree Completion Fee Request\nTranscript Request\nWithdrawal\n• Grade Change\n\nMore\n\n\n\nGrade changes originate with the instructor of the course. The instructor submits a grade change through the MyUW Faculty Center. Instructions are available through the Office of the Registrar’s Grading FAQ webpage. If the change cannot be completed via the online system, the instructor submits a paper Grade Change Form, and the program chair signs and submits it to the Graduate School Office of Academic Services.\nWhile changes from Incomplete or Progress to a final grade are routine and raise no questions, changes from one final grade to another are more serious matters. Doing extra work to improve a final grade is not allowed. Faculty legislation states that final grades can be changed only because of clerical error. Once an instructor announces course grades, a decision to re-evaluate the coursework for all or some of the students breaks faith with those students. The university’s primary concern is that all students in a course are treated consistently and fairly when assigned final grades.\n• Grade Point Average (GPA) Requirement\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe Graduate School requires that students maintain a graduate grade-point average (GPA) of 3.00 (on a 4.00 scale) for all graduate courses (excluding research) to receive a degree. Many programs impose higher standards. Students should check with their program.\nWhen a graduate student’s cumulative GPA drops below a 3.0 for one semester, they are notified via email (copy to grad coordinator) that they are placed on academic probation, and an enrollment hold is placed on the following semester. Students on academic probation cannot continue enrolling until the probationary semester’s grades are reported and their cumulative GPA is above a 3.0.\nCourses taken for audit (S/NR), credit/no credit (CR/N), or pass/fail do not affect the GPA. Research courses graded on a Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) basis do not impact GPA. However, U grades are monitored by the Graduate School for satisfactory progress. A Permanent Incomplete (PI) grade does not impact the GPA. A No Report (NR) or Incomplete (I) grade does not impact the GPA, but in a graded course this is a temporary grade, indicating the instructor has not yet submitted a final grade.\nSee Auditing Courses, Credit/No Credit Grades, No Report (NR) Grades, Pass/Fail, Permanent Incomplete (PI) Grade, Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) Grades, Appendix 3 – Grading System, Appendix 4 – Grade-Point Average Calculation\n• Grading System\n\nMore\n\n\n\nUW–Madison uses a 4.00 grading scale (A=4.00, AB=3.50, etc.). Grades are assigned only by instructors and are electronically reported by letter grade. Plus and minus grades are not used.\nStudents should check with individual professors about grading scales for specific courses.\nAll courses taken as a graduate student that are numbered 300 and above in which a student receives a grade of A, AB, B, BC, C, or S will count toward the Graduate School’s minimum credit requirement.  Courses with grades of P (“in progress”) fulfill the Graduate School’s minimum credit requirement only if they are research courses.  Courses taken under the 300 level, or for audit, pass/fail; or in which a  student receives grades of D or F do not count.\nFor courses listed as research, the only permissible final grades are P (Progress), S (Satisfactory), or U (Unsatisfactory). If a P grade is assigned, it will remain until the faculty member assigns a grade of S or U. All previously assigned P grades in research courses will revert to an S or U upon assignment of the final grade. Research courses (even with grades from terms earlier than Summer 1999) do not count in a student’s GPA. Research courses are traditionally reserved for graduate students; however, other students (Law, Medical, Undergraduate, etc.) occasionally enroll for a research course. In these cases, the student’s college can decide to have the course count in the GPA with an academic action submitted to the Office of the Registrar.\nTo convert UW–Madison Law School numerical grades to the Graduate School’s grading scale, the Graduate School uses the following scale:\n85-100 A\n83-84 AB\n77-82 B\n75-76 BC\n72-74 C\n67-71 D\n65-66 F\nInternational equivalencies may be available in the Wisconsin Directory of International Institutions.\nSee Grade Point Average (GPA) Requirement, Permanent Incomplete (PI) Grade, Progress (P) Grades, Grading System and GPA Calculation\n• Grading System and GPA Calculation\n\nMore\n\n\n\nGrades are assigned only by instructors and are reported only by letter grade.

Graduate/professional certificate programs coordinate teaching and research among scholars active in interrelated disciplines. Consult the certificate program regarding recognition of program completion. Certificate programs monitor their own course and satisfactory progress requirements.\nStudents wishing to pursue a certificate must submit a request to add it to their academic career through the Add/Change/Discontinue application process in the MyGradPortal. This should be done as soon as a student knows they wish to add the certificate and before completing the classes for the certificate.  The certificate must be on the student’s academic career before the prelim (doctoral students) or degree warrant (master’s students) is requested.\nA list of all graduate/professional certificates with specific information for each is  available in the Graduate Guide on the Graduate/Professional Certificates page.\nSee Capstone Certificates\n• Graduation\n\nMore\n\n\n\nTo receive a master’s degree, students contact their program coordinator at the beginning of the term in which they intend to graduate. The program coordinator will check that they have met program requirements and will request a warrant from the Graduate School on the student’s behalf. Students need to be enrolled in their program and taking a minimum of 2 credits (graded courses taken at 300 or above; audits and pass/fails do not satisfy this requirement) during the term in which they intend to graduate. For more information and deadlines visit the Graduate School’s Completing Your Master’s Degree webpage.\nDoctoral candidates’ major programs should request a final doctoral warrant at least 3 weeks before the anticipated date of their final dissertation defense. Doctoral candidates must be enrolled during the term in which they intend to defend or graduate. For more information and deadlines visit the Graduate School’s Completing Your Doctoral Degree webpage.\nSee Certification of Graduation (or ‘Degree Completion Letter’), Deadlines, Degree Completion Fee, Degree Conferral/Payroll End Dates, Dissertation and Thesis Standards and Publishing, Dissertation Defense (Final Examination)\n• Grievances and Appeals\n\nMore\n\n\n\nIf a student feels unfairly treated or aggrieved by faculty, staff, or another student, the university offers several avenues to resolve the concern. All graduate programs, departments and schools/colleges have established specific grievance procedures for handling such situations; these grievance procedures are found in the program’s Graduate Guide page under the policy tab.\nThe department-school/college academic grievance process should be used to resolve academic issues or disputes. Examples of matters suitable for this process may include a qualifying exam failure, author dispute, or concerns regarding advising/mentoring, to name a few.\nGraduate Assistants in TA, PA and/or RA appointments may utilize the Graduate Assistantship Policies and Procedures (GAPP) grievance process to resolve employment-related issues. Examples of matters appropriate for the GAPP grievance process include allegations of violation of GAPP, including allegations excessive work hours, violations of sick days or vacation policies, or disputes regarding the assignment of duties.\nFor issues involving hostile and intimidating behavior (HIB) by a faculty or staff member, students should contact the Graduate School Assistant Dean for Academic Services for information on accessing the the appropriate HIB process.\nFor issues involving civil rights, ADA, Equal Opportunity or Sexual Misconduct, students should contact the Office of Compliance.\nIf you have questions about whether the grievance policy at the program level or GAPP procedure would be suitable for your concern, you are encouraged to reach out to your college, school or division human resources representative.\nThrough A Graduate Student Guide to Working with Faculty Advisors, an interactive, self-paced micro-course, graduate students learn about the characteristics of functional and dysfunctional relationships with faculty advisors, strategies for communicating effectively and aligning expectations, as well as program grievance processes and Hostile and Intimidating Behavior resources. Completion of the micro-course takes about 20 minutes and is optional but encouraged for all graduate students.\nIn addition, the following administrative offices have procedures available for addressing various concerns:\nOffice of Student Assistance and Support (for all issues of concern involving students)\n70 Bascom Hall\n608-263-5700\nEmployee Assistance Office (for conflicts involving graduate assistants and other employees)\nRm. 1109 WARF Building, 610 Walnut St.\n608-263-2987\nOmbuds Office for Faculty and Staff (for graduate students and post-docs, as well as faculty and staff)\n523-524 Lowell Center\n608-265-9992\nGraduate School (for informal advice at any level of review and for official appeals of program/departmental or school/college grievance decisions)\n217 Bascom Hall\n500 Lincoln Drive\nMadison, WI 53706-1380\n608-262-2433\nGraduate students have two levels of appeal when they disagree with the outcome of a grievance or academic decision made at the program/departmental level; these occur in sequence. The first appeal is to the school/college and final appeals are to the Graduate School.\nGraduate School Appeal Process\nGraduate students who believe their appeal was not appropriately handled or resolved at the school/college level may appeal to the Graduate School using the process described below. (For students in programs housed in the Graduate School, the appeal of a program decision will typically be handled by the school/college in which the faculty/academic advisor of the student has their tenure/primary appointment before an appeal may be considered by the Graduate School.)\nAppeals of school/college decisions to the Graduate School should be based upon one or both of the following grounds:\n\nThere was a procedural error that substantially affected the fairness or outcome of the school/college grievance or academic decision appeal process.\nThe information in the record does not support the school/college decision.\n\nIf a student believes that their appeal meets one or both grounds listed above, they may file an official appeal of a school/college decision with the Graduate School using the process described below.\nA student must submit an appeal to the Graduate School Assistant Dean for Academic Services within 14 calendar days of the school/college decision. Prior to submitting an appeal, students are encouraged to contact the Assistant Dean to obtain information about the process, timelines, and to seek clarification of any questions they may have about the process.\nTo be considered, appeals must include the following information:\n\nThe student’s name, local address, university email address and phone number.\nThe student’s program name and degree level.\nThe ground(s) upon which the appeal is based and for each ground stated, an explanation of why the student’s appeal meets those criteria.\nCopies of the department and school/college appeal decisions and any other relevant communications.\n\nUpon receipt of all the above materials:\n\nThe Assistant Dean for Academic Services will forward the appeal and related documents to the Dean of the Graduate School.\nThe student will be notified in writing within 10 calendar days after the appeal materials arrive in the Graduate School, acknowledging receipt of the formal appeal and giving the student a timeline for the appeal to be completed.\nThe program and school/college will be notified of the appeal to the Graduate School and will be provided with a copy of the student’s appeal statement and associated documents.  The program and school/college will be invited to submit a written response.\nThe dean will appoint an advisory committee comprised of faculty and/or staff with the appropriate expertise to evaluate the appeal.\nThe dean will charge the committee and set appropriate time frame (30 calendar days within the fall and spring semester; appeals received in the summer may take up to 60 calendar days) for completing a review and making a recommendation.\n\n\nThe committee will review the student’s appeal, including all the materials previously submitted. If necessary, the committee may request and review additional information relevant to the appeal from the student and/or program/department/School/College before making a recommendation.\nThe dean will issue the final decision in writing.\n• There was a procedural error that substantially affected the fairness or outcome of the school/college grievance or academic decision appeal process.\n• The information in the record does not support the school/college decision.\n• The student’s name, local address, university email address and phone number.\n• The student’s program name and degree level.\n• The ground(s) upon which the appeal is based and for each ground stated, an explanation of why the student’s appeal meets those criteria.\n• Copies of the department and school/college appeal decisions and any other relevant communications.\n• The Assistant Dean for Academic Services will forward the appeal and related documents to the Dean of the Graduate School.\n• The student will be notified in writing within 10 calendar days after the appeal materials arrive in the Graduate School, acknowledging receipt of the formal appeal and giving the student a timeline for the appeal to be completed.\n• The program and school/college will be notified of the appeal to the Graduate School and will be provided with a copy of the student’s appeal statement and associated documents.  The program and school/college will be invited to submit a written response.\n• The dean will appoint an advisory committee comprised of faculty and/or staff with the appropriate expertise to evaluate the appeal.\n• The dean will charge the committee and set appropriate time frame (30 calendar days within the fall and spring semester; appeals received in the summer may take up to 60 calendar days) for completing a review and making a recommendation.\n• The committee will review the student’s appeal, including all the materials previously submitted. If necessary, the committee may request and review additional information relevant to the appeal from the student and/or program/department/School/College before making a recommendation.\n• The dean will issue the final decision in writing.\n• Holds (Service Indicators)\n\nMore\n\n\n\nWhen using the enrollment system, students may encounter holds on their records, preventing them from enrolling in classes. Holds can also prevent students from obtaining a transcript, a degree completion letter, certification of status, or a diploma. Their enrollment notification will indicate the type of hold and where it must be cleared. Hold information is also available on MyUW. Students should direct questions to the originator of the hold.\nSee Dean’s Approval, Probation\n• Honors Courses\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe Graduate School does not have an honors program, and graduate students may not enroll in Honors Only courses or in Honors Optional courses for honors credit or otherwise receive honors credit for completing optional extra work in a course. If a graduate student enrolls in a mixed graduate/undergraduate course section with an Honors Optional designation, the graduate student must maintain the default “do not take with honors” selection for their enrollment. If a graduate student does select “take with Honors” as part of their enrollment for such a course, the Graduate School will remove that Honors status.\n• Incompletes\n\nMore\n\n\n\nStudents who are unable to complete coursework by the end of the semester may request from the instructor the assignment of the temporary grade of “I” (Incomplete).  Students making a request for an I grade must have been carrying passing grade until near the end of the term.  If the Incomplete grade is granted the student should complete the missing work as soon as possible.  Students who receive an Incomplete grade will receive a warning message from the Graduate School, reminding them that students are not permitted to graduate with an Incomplete grade on their transcripts. Graduate students are allowed the subsequent semester of enrollment to complete the coursework before the Graduate School will place the student on academic probation. Programs may impose more stringent rules for satisfactory progress.\nIn consultation with the program, students may be dismissed from the Graduate School for failing to complete coursework and receive a final grade in a timely fashion.\nStudents with outstanding Incomplete grades may not receive  dissertator status or be granted a degree.\nIf the work is no longer relevant, the instructor of a course is no longer at the university, or a change of program makes completion of the work unnecessary, students may be allowed to receive a Permanent Incomplete (PI) for the course. The instructor of the course or their advisor submits a grade change request with an explanation or reason, changing the grade from I to PI. The Office of the Registrar also converts any incomplete grade over 5 years old to PI. Students may graduate with PI’s on their transcript.\nUnresolved Incomplete grades lapse to a grade of Permanent Incomplete (PI) after five years.\nSee Permanent Incomplete (PI) Grade, Probation, Satisfactory Progress\n• Individual Development Plan\n\nMore\n\n\n\nUW–Madison recommends all graduate students and postdoctoral researchers utilize Individual Development Plans to set academic and career goals and facilitate conversations with their mentor(s). All graduate students and postdoctoral researchers supported by NIH funding are required to have an Individual Development Plan (IDP). Other funding agencies may have additional requirements related to the IDP.\nIDPs are written plans that give mentees ownership and structure to assess their skills, interests, and values, define clear and actionable goals, explore career options, and facilitate conversations with their mentor(s). IDP forms vary greatly, although many are structured around core competencies or learning outcomes. The onus for writing, maintaining, and implementing the plan is on the mentee, and conversations with and feedback from the mentor(s) are essential.\nThe Graduate School will identify individuals who must complete an IDP and will notify them of tools and resources available. The Graduate School will offer graduate students, postdocs, and PIs tools to track IDP progress. The IDP tracking tool will log activity related to the IDP, but the actual contents of the IDP will not be captured by the tracking tool. The contents of the IDP are private to the mentee, who chooses which parts of the IDP to share with his or her selected mentor(s). Find the IDP template for graduate students and postdoc mentees, guidelines and other supporting resources for mentors and mentees, resources for PIs and grants administrators, including the IDP tracking tool.\n• Insurance and Medical Benefits\n\nMore\n\n\n\nIf students have been awarded a fellowship, traineeship, or an assistantship with at least a one-third (33%) appointment per term (or an equivalent), they qualify for full medical benefits. In order to activate medical insurance benefits, students contact their department’s/program’s benefits coordinator.\nStudents who are currently enrolled as UW–Madison students and have paid segregated fees can also use the services of University Health Services (UHS). University Health Services is the health clinic on campus, open to any current UW–Madison student (excluding guest students). UHS offers insurance through SHIP (Student Health Insurance Plan), which is located on the premises. SHIP is a comprehensive insurance plan for UW–Madison students that covers additional health care costs incurred both at UHS and elsewhere. This includes travel and meningitis immunizations, prescription drugs, and oral contraceptives at UHS as well as after hours, emergency room, hospitalization, and other specialized medical services locally and nationwide.\nFor more information or questions, contact UHS or SHIP.\nInternational students, or visiting J-1 scholars, and their visa dependents residing in the U.S. must meet the mandatory health insurance requirements of UW–Madison. International students must show compliance with these requirements by registering with the SHIP office. Students may register either by enrolling in the SHIP Health Plan or by filing a waiver application (if they satisfy the qualifying conditions). Failure to register by the specified deadlines will result in a $100 late fee in addition to any required SHIP premiums.\nPlease note: Students do not have to file a waiver if they have employment through UW–Madison and they meet all of the following conditions:\n\nThey are employed at UW–Madison and are receiving full medical benefits which were effective on or before September 1 (for fall) or February 1 (for spring/summer).\nThey are a member of one of the following health insurance plans: Group Health Cooperative, Unity Health Plans, Physicians Plus, Dean Health Care, or Standard Plan.\nThey are the primary subscriber (not a dependent) of their health insurance plan.\n\nIf a student meets all of the above criteria, the SHIP office will file an automatic waiver on his/her behalf.\nAdditional information regarding SHIP, including enrollment and waiver policies, can be found here.\nGraduate students traveling abroad for study or research are encouraged to acquire international health insurance through Cultural Insurance Services International (CISI). All University of Wisconsin students studying/traveling abroad under a UW sponsored program must enroll in health insurance through CISI). Further information about international health insurance can be found here.\nSee Benefits, Appendix 2 – Payroll Benefits\n• They are employed at UW–Madison and are receiving full medical benefits which were effective on or before September 1 (for fall) or February 1 (for spring/summer).\n• They are a member of one of the following health insurance plans: Group Health Cooperative, Unity Health Plans, Physicians Plus, Dean Health Care, or Standard Plan.\n• They are the primary subscriber (not a dependent) of their health insurance plan.\n• Joint Degrees\n\nMore\n\n\n\nA joint degree consists of one graduate degree with two programs. A student completing a joint degree writes one thesis or dissertation and receives one diploma. Students can earn a joint master’s or a joint doctoral degree. Such degrees are relatively rare. Students should inquire with each program prior to enrollment to see if additional policies exist that would restrict the ability to complete a joint degree.\nTo apply for a joint degree a student must submit a proposal for the degree to the Graduate School along with an electronic Add/Change/Discontinue Program Request. A student must be admitted to the second program. An appropriate Associate Dean of the Graduate School reviews all such proposals.\nStudents must submit the proposal before they complete the coursework and no later than the beginning of their second year of graduate study.\nThe joint degree proposal must address the following issues:\n\nReasons for seeking a joint degree, rather than following the traditional program/minor curriculum (for doctoral programs that require a minor) or double degrees curriculum (for master’s programs).\nCoursework necessary to satisfy each program’s requirements; two separate course lists required.\nThe required content of each program’s portion of the degree requirements in the proposal (for example, preliminary exam arrangements for the doctoral degree or a joint thesis required for the master’s degree, etc.).\n\nTo receive a joint degree, students must:\n\nBe admitted to both programs, with approval of their proposal from both programs;\nComplete the degree requirements in each program as outlined in the proposal;\nFulfill the Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence, degree, and coursework (50%) credit requirements.\nBe recommended for the degree by the faculty co-chairs/advisors from each program and the program director from each program, approval signatures required.\n\nOnce a joint degree proposal has been reviewed and approved, any and all changes must be submitted to the Graduate School for further review.\nFor further details about joint degrees, contact the Graduate School Office of Academic Services.\nSee Double Degrees, Dual Degrees: Graduate and Professional Combination, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Special Graduate Committee Degrees, Appendix 5 – Double, Joint, and Dual Degrees at a Glance\n• Reasons for seeking a joint degree, rather than following the traditional program/minor curriculum (for doctoral programs that require a minor) or double degrees curriculum (for master’s programs).\n• Coursework necessary to satisfy each program’s requirements; two separate course lists required.\n• The required content of each program’s portion of the degree requirements in the proposal (for example, preliminary exam arrangements for the doctoral degree or a joint thesis required for the master’s degree, etc.).\n• Be admitted to both programs, with approval of their proposal from both programs;\n• Complete the degree requirements in each program as outlined in the proposal;\n• Fulfill the Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence, degree, and coursework (50%) credit requirements.\n• Be recommended for the degree by the faculty co-chairs/advisors from each program and the program director from each program, approval signatures required.\n• Jury Duty\n\nMore\n\n\n\nIf a student is called to jury duty and the duty is sustained over a period of three weeks or more, the student should be allowed to withdraw from classes. If extended jury duty should continue after the last day of class, the instructor has the option of assigning an Incomplete (I) as the student’s grade. The I grade will not result in academic probation or the removal of dissertator status. Further information is available at Graduate School’s Office of Academic Services.\n• Language Requirements\n\nMore\n\n\n\nEach program sets its own language requirements. Some programs require competence in one or more languages before students can take preliminary examinations. Students must check with their major program’s criteria for satisfactory progress in the program’s student handbook, or in the Graduate Guide.\n• Late Enrollment/Late Course Change/Late Drop\n\nMore\n\n\n\nIt is a student’s responsibility to be aware of the deadlines for enrollment each term. All session deadlines are adhered to as detailed on the Office of the Registrar’s Enrollment Deadlines page.\nLate Initial Enrollment: Students have through the end of the second week to enroll in courses for fall or spring term. If students enroll after the first week of class, they are subject to late payment fees. Permission to enroll late does not excuse students from paying late initial enrollment and/or late payment penalties. Exceptions to the published deadlines will be granted only in the case of truly mitigating circumstances. Late initial enrollment cannot be completed in MyUW; a Late initial Enrollment Request Form must be submitted along with written approval from the student’s faculty advisor. Refer to the chart below for detailed steps to late initial enrollment.\nLate course changes (add a class, change credit, change sections): After deadlines have passed, late course adds can be requested by submitting a completed Late Course Add Request Form to the Graduate School. Other courses changes may be requested via the Course Change Request in MyUW. For more information, see the Registrar’s Office enrollment overview.  For all changes, the Course Change Request must be printed from MyUW and required signatures must be obtained along with written approval from the student’s faculty advisor. Refer to the chart below for detailed steps to late course changes. The Dean’s signature will be fulfilled once submitted to the Graduate School.\nLate Drop: The electronic Course Change Request process via MyUW Student Center is not accessible for late drops. Students must complete the Graduate School Late Course Drop Request Form along with written justification from the student’s faculty advisor. Please note that poor academic performance in a course is not an acceptable reason for a late drop request.  Refer to the chart below for detailed steps to late drops.\n\n\n\nAction\nWhen During the Semester\nStudent’s Process\n\n\n\n\nLate Initial Enrollment:\nAfter the 2nd week of class (fall/spring terms, different deadlines apply for summer sessions)\n\n\nStudents must fill out the Late Initial Enrollment Request Form and obtain all required signatures.\nStudents must obtain written approval from their faculty advisor.\nEmail the Late Initial Enrollment Request From and faculty advisor approval to the Graduate School at Academic Services.\n\n\n\n\nLate Course Change (Add/Change Credit/Change Section)\nAfter the 9th week of classes (fall/spring terms, different deadlines apply for summer sessions)\n\n\nFor late course adds, students must complete and submit a Late Course Add Request form.    For credit/section changes, students must complete an electronic Course Change Request in MyUW, print the form and obtain required signatures.\nStudents must obtain written approval from their faculty advisor.\nEmail the form and written approval to the Graduate School at Academic Services.\n\n\n\n\nLate Drop\nSee Registrar’s Office  Dates/Deadlines page for specific drop deadline information (fall/spring terms, different deadlines apply for summer sessions)\n\n\nStudents must fill out the Late Course Drop Form and obtain all required signatures.\nStudents must obtain written justification from their faculty advisor.\nEmail the Late Course Drop Form and written justification to the Graduate School at Academic Services.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more information about late enrollment, late course change or late drop, contact the Graduate School Office of Academic Services.\nSee Course Changes, Dean’s Approval\n• Students must fill out the Late Initial Enrollment Request Form and obtain all required signatures.\n• Students must obtain written approval from their faculty advisor.\n• Email the Late Initial Enrollment Request From and faculty advisor approval to the Graduate School at Academic Services.\n• For late course adds, students must complete and submit a Late Course Add Request form.    For credit/section changes, students must complete an electronic Course Change Request in MyUW, print the form and obtain required signatures.\n• Students must obtain written approval from their faculty advisor.\n• Email the form and written approval to the Graduate School at Academic Services.\n• Students must fill out the Late Course Drop Form and obtain all required signatures.\n• Students must obtain written justification from their faculty advisor.\n• Email the Late Course Drop Form and written justification to the Graduate School at Academic Services.\n• Leave of Absence\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe Graduate School does not have a formal policy on leave of absence for pre-dissertators. Students should notify their graduate program of their intention to take a leave of absence.\nIf students have pre-enrolled for a future term and plan to take a leave of absence, they must be sure to drop all courses before the first day of class.\nPreviously enrolled students who wish to return to Graduate School should follow the instructions for Readmission to Graduate School. Any student who does not enroll for a fall or spring term is considered to be a reentry and must pay the Graduate School online application fee. Any student granted readmission must adhere to the most current requirements as listed in the Graduate School Academic Policies & Procedures. Master’s degree students who have been absent for five or more consecutive years lose all credits that they have earned before their absence. Doctoral degree students who have been absent for ten or more consecutive years lose all credits that they have earned before their absence. Individual programs may count the coursework students completed prior to their absence for meeting program requirements; however that coursework will not count toward Graduate School credit requirements.\nNon-dissertators: The Graduate School has no formal policy regarding a leave of absence at the pre-dissertator level, although some programs do. Therefore, it is critical that students contact their major programs before considering a break in enrollment of one or more terms.\nDissertators: A candidate for a doctoral degree should be aware that failure to take the final oral examination and submit the dissertation within 5 years after passing the preliminary examination may require another preliminary examination and admittance to candidacy a second time. In addition, the Graduate School requires all dissertators to maintain continuous enrollment. In rare circumstances when this is not possible, a degree completion fee is assessed to recognize the inevitable use of university facilities (including faculty and staff time) up to and including the successful defense of the dissertation.\nInternational Students: International students considering a leave of absence should check on their visa status with International Student Services.\nGraduate Appointments: Students with Teaching Assistantships (TA), Program Assistantships (PA), or Research Assistantships (RA) should consult with their program, their PI and/or advisor. Students with Fellowships or Traineeships should contact their funding source.\nSee Degree Completion Fee, Family Leave, International Students Maintaining Legal Status, Readmission to Graduate School (for previously enrolled graduate students), Time Limits\n• Maximum Credits per Term\n\nMore\n\n\n\nNon-dissertator students are allowed to enroll for a maximum of 15 credits. The enrollment system counts all credits in determining maximum credit loads. Even though pass/fail courses, audit courses, and 100- or 200-level courses are considered undergraduate level credits, they are counted in total credit load.\nSee Enrollment Requirements\n• Maximum Levels of Appointments\n\nMore\n\n\n\nUniversity policy restricts appointment levels for Project, Research, or Teaching Assistants; fellows; trainees; and university staff who are enrolled as graduate students. The levels established by the university are maximums, not minimums or expected levels.\nProject Assistant (PA) and Teaching Assistant (TA)\nAppointments exceeding 75% for domestic students are rare and require approval of the advisor and chair of the payrolling program(s), the payrolling college dean’s office(s), and the Graduate School. Some colleges, schools, or programs may set lower limits, but in general require prior specific approvals if the appointment or some combination of appointments exceeds 75%. Project Assistants may be employed 100% during summer term, semester breaks, and spring vacation. International students cannot have an appointment exceeding 50% during the spring and fall terms. International students should refer to information from International Student Services for additional appointment restrictions.\nResearch Assistant (RA)\nAppointments exceeding 50% are not permitted. Domestic students may have a combination of appointments not exceeding 75% with no more than 50% being the RA appointment. International students cannot have any combination of a RA and another appointment over 50%. International students should refer to information from International Student Services for additional appointment restrictions.\nPredoctoral Fellows/Trainees\nStudents can hold a concurrent appointment as a TA, RA, PA, or student hourly with their fellowship within the limits set out in the current university policy. Whenever assistantships (RA, TA, or PA) are combined with fellowships or traineeships, total compensation cannot exceed the full-time RA rate of the student’s academic home department, as it was reported to the Graduate School for the current year (fellowship/traineeship + assistantship = total compensation). The list of approved program rates can be found on the Graduate Assistantships webpage, under Assistantship Stipends by Program. More information about concurrent appointment policy for fellows/trainees can be found in the University of Wisconsin–Madison Policy for Supplementation and Concurrent Appointments for Graduate Students Holding Predoctoral Fellowships or Traineeships.\nLimited/Academic Staff, Non-dissertators\nCombinations of appointment percentages and academic load percentage exceeding 175% are very unusual because of the difficulty that such academic loads place on the ability of the employee to perform their responsibilities. Therefore, approval by the employing division’s dean/director (or designee) is required prior to the start of classes. The Graduate School dean should be informed in writing of any approved requests. See Chapter 11.03 of the Unclassified Personnel Policies and Procedures document for the current university policy entitled, Employees Enrolled as UW–Madison Students.\nLimited/Academic Staff, Dissertators\nCombinations of appointment percentages and academic load percentage exceeding 175% are more common because dissertators have no classes to attend. Although these are approved only at the program chair or director level, the employing unit’s dean/director (or designee) and the Dean of the Graduate School must be informed in writing of any approved requests. See Chapter 11.03 of the Unclassified Personnel Policies and Procedures document for the current university policy entitled, Employees Enrolled as UW–Madison Students.\nStudent hourly\nIn some situations it may be appropriate to hire graduate students as student hourly help. Employers should contact their Dean’s office to determine when this is appropriate. Maximum levels for appointments also include student hourly appointments. See Chapter 1.06 of the Unclassified Personnel Policies and Procedures document for the current university policy entitled, Student Hourly Help.\nFor any combination of appointments (except fellowships and traineeships), the total appointment percentage may not exceed 75%.\nA 100% academic load for graduate students is:\n\nNon-dissertators: Fall or spring terms, 8 graded credits in courses numbered 300 or above; summer sessions, 4 graded credits in courses numbered 300 or above.\nDissertators: Fall, spring, or summer, 3 graded credits numbered 300 or above.\n\nIf a student holds an assistantship concurrently with a staff appointment, the combination of appointments may not exceed 75%, regardless of the number of credits for which the student is enrolled.\nFurther information about maximum levels of appointments can be found in the University of Wisconsin–Madison Maximum Levels of Graduate Assistantship Appointments Policy\nSee Enrollment Requirements,\n• Non-dissertators: Fall or spring terms, 8 graded credits in courses numbered 300 or above; summer sessions, 4 graded credits in courses numbered 300 or above.\n• Dissertators: Fall, spring, or summer, 3 graded credits numbered 300 or above.\n• Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe minimum graduate coursework (50%) requirement states that at least 50% of credits applied toward the program’s graduate degree credit requirement must be courses designed for graduate work (this includes but is not limited to online, thesis/research, independent study, and practicum/internship credits).  Courses taken as a University Special student are not allowed to count toward the 50% graduate coursework minimum unless taken at the 700 level or above.\nFor students taking coursework through the fall 2015 term, the official university record which identifies programs documented “graduate level” coursework is each program’s Minimum Degree Requirements and Satisfactory Progress chart in the 2014-2016 Graduate School catalog.  The official University documentation of “graduate level” coursework is identified with the graduate course attribute (G50%) in the University’s Course Guide and Class Search. More information regarding the course attribute can be found on the Academic Planning and Institutional Research (APIR) website.\nStudents should be aware that some programs may require more rigorous credit minimums than the Graduate School’s minimum. Students should visit their program’s Minimum Degree Requirements and Satisfactory Progress chart and contact their graduate program coordinator for program specific degree requirements.\nSee Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Prior Coursework, University Special Student Status, Time Limits\n• Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe Graduate School’s minimum graduate degree credit requirement is a degree requirement instituted by the Graduate Faculty Executive Committee to ensure that a graduate degree meets institution accreditation standards (this includes but is not limited to online, thesis/research, independent study, and practicum internships credits).\nGraduate Degree Credit Minimums\nMaster’s Degree: 30 credits\n(except MFA)\nM.F.A. /Specialist Certificate: 42 credits\n(may include master’s degree credits taken at UW–Madison)\nDoctoral Degree: 51 credits\n(may include master’s degree credits taken at UW–Madison and credits take while a dissertator)\nThe doctoral degree minimum graduate degree credit requirement may be achieved with credits earned before or after dissertator status.

Students under this program will be classified as nonresidents of Wisconsin.\nStudents with a Research Assistantship (RA), that covers all instructional costs, will be billed as nonresidents, not Minnesota reciprocity rates. The end result to the student is the same, as students are only responsible for the segregated fees.\nStudents who are not certified for the program prior to the date fees are due must either pay nonresident rates and be refunded the difference in tuition upon certification by MOHE, or delay payment until certification is issued and include the $100.00 late payment fee due at that time.\nIt is the student’s responsibility to inquire of MOHE about the suitability of reapplying, application procedures, and deadlines. Questions and application requests should be directed to the Minnesota Office of Higher Education.\n• Misconduct, Academic\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe university holds graduate students to a high standard of academic integrity and believes that misconduct may warrant university discipline in addition to sanctions imposed by an instructor. Graduate students who have been found by their instructors to commit academic misconduct can expect that the Office for Student Conduct and Community Standards will consider whether to impose a further disciplinary sanction of university probation, suspension, or expulsion.\nChapter 14 of the University of Wisconsin Administrative Code defines academic misconduct as follows:\nAcademic misconduct is an act in which a student:\n\nseeks to claim credit for the work or efforts of another without authorization or citation;\nuses unauthorized materials or fabricated data in any academic exercise;\nforges or falsifies academic documents or records;\nintentionally impedes or damages the academic work of others;\nengages in conduct aimed at making false representation of a student’s academic performance; or\nassists other students in any of these acts. UWS 14.03(1)\n\nExamples of academic misconduct include but are not limited to:\n\ncutting and pasting text from the Web without quotation marks or proper citation;\nparaphrasing from the Web without crediting the source;\nusing notes or a programmable calculator in an exam when such use is not allowed;\nusing another person’s ideas, words, or research and presenting it as one’s own by not properly crediting the originator;\nstealing examinations or course materials;\nchanging or creating data in a lab experiment;\naltering a transcript;\nsigning another person’s name to an attendance sheet;\nhiding a book knowing that another student needs it to prepare for an assignment;\ncollaboration that is contrary to the stated rules of the course; or\ntampering with a lab experiment or computer program of another student.\n\nThe full text of the state statute governing academic misconduct, University of Wisconsin System (UWS) 14, Student Academic Disciplinary Procedures, as well as the UW–campus procedures for implementing the provisions of UWS 14 and general information about academic misconduct, are available here or from the Division of Student Life.\n• seeks to claim credit for the work or efforts of another without authorization or citation;\n• uses unauthorized materials or fabricated data in any academic exercise;\n• forges or falsifies academic documents or records;\n• intentionally impedes or damages the academic work of others;\n• engages in conduct aimed at making false representation of a student’s academic performance; or\n• assists other students in any of these acts.

This grade is not the same as an Incomplete (I), which indicates that the student’s work was unfinished at the end of the term.\nAll grades for 790, 890, 990 that are unreported (previously assigned an NR) by the end of the grading period will be automatically assigned a P (Progress). The P grades will automatically revert to S grades upon assignment of the grade for the final semester of enrollment in the course. If the instructors had intended a different grade (S, U, or I), they would need to use the electronic grade change process.\nSee Grading System, Incomplete Grades, Progress (P) Grades, Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) Grades\n• Overloads\n\nMore\n\n\n\nStudents are allowed to enroll for a maximum of 15 credits during fall and spring. Summer maximum enrollment is 12 credits. Credits included are those courses numbered 300 or above, taken for a grade (not including audits and pass/fail).\nDissertators are not eligible for overloads in the fall or spring terms. However, in the summer, a dissertator who is enrolled in the general 8-week session for 3 credits may request an overload for 1-2 additional credits in a short session and still retain dissertator status.  For such requests to be approved, the course must be related to dissertation research or professional training that is not offered in regular semesters. Faculty advisors can request an overload exception for summer from the Graduate School Degree Coordinator.\nThe enrollment system counts all credits in determining maximum credit loads. An overload request is required if a student wishes to exceed the maximum number of credits they are allowed as a graduate student. Even though pass/fail courses, audit courses, and 100- or 200-level courses are not considered graduate level credits, they are counted in a total credit load. An overload request is also required if the number of credits exceeds the span of weeks in any short session during the summer (but not for a dissertator).\nIf a student wishes to enroll for more than the maximum credit load, they must submit a Credit Overload Request form, signed by their advisor, to the Graduate School Office of Academic Services. The Graduate School will look closely at the rationale for the request, the student’s course load, satisfactory progress, and assistantships. Overloads to 16-17 credits during the fall and spring semesters are generally allowed. Overloads to 18 credits are only approved for fall/spring if some of the credits are taken in a short term prior to or during the semester  If the Graduate School approves the overload, the student will then be allowed to add the course.\nSee Enrollment Requirements, Maximum Levels of Appointments\n• Pass/Fail Courses\n\nMore\n\n\n\nPass/fail courses do not satisfy any Graduate School credit, coursework, or degree requirements, nor do they fulfill minimum or maximum credits required each term. Tuition is still charged for pass/fail course. For these reasons, very few graduate students choose pass/fail for courses numbered 300 or above. Seminars, independent study, and research may not be taken pass/fail. The pass/fail option is not to be confused with the S/U grading option.\nStudents requesting to enroll in a course as pass/fail must first enroll or be enrolled in the course.  The request is made via the MyUW Student Center by submitting an online Course Change Request, changing the course to pass/fail. After the student requests this change online via MyUW Student Center, they submit the pass/fail form to the Graduate School either electronically at gsacserv@grad.wisc.edu or in person in room 217 Bascom Hall where it is reviewed and approved by the Graduate School.  The deadline to request/cancel pass/fail is the drop deadline, which is the end of the 9th week of class during the fall and spring semester. Requests for late pass/fail will not be considered. Specific deadline dates, including those for summer sessions, are posted prior to each semester by the Office of the Registrar.\nThe instructor does not know that a student is taking the course on a pass/fail basis and therefore reports a letter grade for the course. The Registrar records a grade of S in place of the instructors’ grades of A, AB, B, BC, or C; and a grade of U in place of D or F grades. Neither the S nor the U are computed in the graduate grade-point average.\nThe enrollment system counts all credits in determining maximum credit loads. A Credit Overload Request is required if a student’s total credit load exceeds the maximum limit per term.\nSee Dean’s Approval, Enrollment Requirements, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Overloads, Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) Grades\n• Payroll Benefits for Graduate Assistants, Fellows, and Trainees\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFellow\nTrainee\nResearch Assistant\nProject Assistant\nTeaching Assistant\n\n\n\n\nSubject to State and Federal Income Taxes\nyes1\nyes1\nyes\nyes\nyes\n\n\nWithholding\nno2\nno2\nyes\nyes\nyes\n\n\nSubject to FICA Tax\nno\nno\nno3\nno3\nno3\n\n\nW2\nno4\nno4\nyes\nyes\nyes\n\n\nHealth Insurance (if at least 33% time appointment or an equivalent*)\nyes\nyes\nyes\nyes\nyes\n\n\nRemission of nonresident portion of tuition (if at least 33% time appointment or an equivalent*)\nyes\nno\nyes, unless student is enrolled in a service-based pricing program5\nyes, unless student is enrolled in a service-based pricing program5\nyes, unless student is enrolled in a service-based pricing program5\n\n\nRemission of resident portion of tuition (if at least 33% time appointment or an equivalent*)\nno\nno\nyes6, unless student is enrolled in a service-based pricing program5\nyes6, unless student is enrolled in a service-based pricing program5\nyes6, unless student is enrolled in a service-based pricing program5\n\n\nVacation\nno\nvaries\nyes\nyes\nno\n\n\nSick Leave\nno\nvaries\nyes\nyes\nyes\n\n\n\n1 May deduct tuition, fees, and books from stipends when calculating taxable income.\n2 Except international students.

The instructor of the course or their advisor submits a grade change request with an explanation or reason, changing the grade from I to PI. The Office of the Registrar also converts any incomplete grade over 5 years old to PI. Students may graduate with PI’s on their transcript.\nSee Incomplete Grades\n• Portal (MyGradPortal)\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe Graduate Portal is an online resource for students and graduate coordinators. Students use the Portal to complete academic actions such as adding or changing their major, discovering professional development opportunities, and submitting payment for the completion of their doctoral degrees. Graduate Coordinators request degree warrants (master’s, preliminary exams, and doctoral) through the Portal.  Students should spend time becoming familiar with the Portal and its features.\nAccessing MyUW and the Graduate Student Portal\n\nGo to wisc.edu and open your MyUW in the top red banner.

If you do not see the tile, you can search for it in the top search bar and add it to your page.\n• Once in your Portal page, select the tile on the home page titled “Add/Change Programs.”\n• In the “Enrolled Programs” section, you will have options to add a Graduate/Professional certificate, doctoral minor (PhD students only), or major. You also have the option to discontinue a program in which you are already enrolled.\n• Preliminary Examinations\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe preliminary examination is a significant milestone in a doctoral student’s academic career. It is given to assess knowledge of areas within the academic discipline. Passing of the preliminary area exam, obtaining approval of the minor if the major program requires it, and completing all the major course requirements culminate in admission to candidacy for the doctoral degree.\nStudents’ eligibility to take the prelim examination(s) is determined by their program. The program notifies the Graduate School of a student’s admission to candidacy on the preliminary warrant, which must be requested 3 weeks prior to the exam date. The number of examinations and their content vary from program to program. A student’s program administers the examination(s).\nAfter passing the preliminary examination, students have 5 years to take the final examination (i.e. dissertation defense) and deposit their dissertation. The 5-year clock starts on the first day of instruction of the term (Fall, Spring, or Summer) immediately following the completion of the preliminary examination. Failure to complete their degree within this period may result in students having to retake the preliminary examination and be re-admitted to candidacy.\nTime limit extension for dissertators impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic\nTo offer flexibility amidst the major disruption that COVID-19 may have had on doctoral candidates’ research and scholarship progress, students who achieved dissertator status by the end of the 2020 summer term have automatically had the 5-year time limit extended by 8 months. Dissertators given this 8-month extension who need more time due to continued COVID-related disruption to their progress may request a further extension from the Graduate School. Decisions to extend the deadline beyond the additional 8 months are made on a case-by-case basis upon request of the student and approval of their advisor. Upon advisor approval, the advisor then requests an extension from the Graduate School by submitting the request to the PhD degree coordinator at gsacserv@grad.wisc.edu.\nSee Certificate of Doctoral Candidacy, Dissertator Status, Time Limits, Warrants\n• Prior Coursework\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe Graduate School does not transfer credits for previous coursework.  However, a student’s program may decide to accept coursework completed outside of the student’s graduate career at UW–Madison under the conditions detailed below.  Any prior coursework accepted under these parameters must have been rigorous and meet the expectations of a graduate work for the degree. Coursework earned five or more years prior to admission to a master’s degree or coursework earned ten or more years prior to admission to a doctoral degree is not allowed to satisfy requirements.\nSatisfying Requirements with Prior Graduate Coursework from Other Institutions\nA student’s program may decide to accept graduate coursework completed at another institution (earned post-baccalaureate) toward fulfillment of minimum degree, minimum graduate coursework, and minor credit requirements. This work will not appear on a UW–Madison transcript nor count towards the graduate career GPA. The Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence credit requirement can be satisfied only with courses taken as a graduate student at UW–Madison. The only exception is graduate-level coursework taken as a Big Ten Academic Alliance Traveling Scholar.\nSatisfying Requirements with Coursework from Undergraduate Career at UW–Madison\nFor well-prepared advanced students, a student’s program may decide to accept up to seven credits numbered 300 or above of required or elective courses from the undergraduate work completed at UW–Madison towards fulfillment of minimum degree and minor credit requirements. However, this work would not be allowed to count toward the 50% graduate coursework minimum unless taken at the 700 level or above. This work will not appear on the graduate career portion of UW–Madison transcript nor count towards the graduate career GPA. The Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence credit requirement can be satisfied only with courses taken as a graduate student at UW–Madison.\nSatisfying Requirements with Coursework from Undergraduate Career outside of UW-Madison (Policy on Exceptions for Specialized Accreditation to Allow Undergraduate Credits Towards a Graduate Degree) \nWhen considering the undergraduate category of prior coursework, the Graduate Faculty Executive Committee (GFEC) restricts the seven credits of undergraduate work to UW-Madison courses because of the challenges associated with assessing the rigor of courses taught at other institutions.\nAccredited programs may request an exception to this policy to allow up to seven credits of undergraduate coursework from other institutions to count toward a graduate degree based on specialized accreditation.  The process for requesting an exception was approved by the GFEC in 2014 and is as follows in italics:\nAn exception to allow up to seven credits from an undergraduate degree earned at a non UW- Madison institution to count toward a UW-Madison graduate degree can be requested on a program-by-program basis when the following two conditions are met:\n1) students have received their undergraduate degree in the same discipline as they are pursuing graduate work, and \n2) the undergraduate degree has been granted from a program which is accredited by the same accrediting body as the UW-Madison program.\nShould a program decide to request an exception to this policy, it must provide the Graduate School with information requested on the undergraduate credit exception form to be eligible for consideration. Please note submission of an exception request does not provide assurance of its approval.\nIf a program believes a student situation meets these criteria, it must request this exception by completing the steps as outlined in the undergraduate credit exception form.  A request may be made at any time, but please note that the earliest date for implementation is the term AFTER Graduate School approval.  Please direct any questions to Emily Reynolds at emily.reynolds@wisc.edu.\nTransfer from University Special Student Career at UW–Madison\nAfter admission to a graduate program, the student’s program may decide to accept up to fifteen University Special student credits as fulfillment of the minimum graduate residence, graduate degree, or minor credit requirements on occasion as an exception (on a case-by-case basis). In all these cases, the student would have to pay the difference in tuition for the terms in question. Those credits earned in a University Special student semester still appear in the transcript history as “University Special” student, but the Registrar’s Office will add a statement in the beginning of the transcript “All credits taken in [term] as a University Special student have been accepted by the Graduate School toward a degree program” after the student has paid the difference in tuition. UW–Madison coursework taken as a University Special student would not be allowed to count toward the 50% graduate coursework minimum unless taken at the 700 level or above. This work will not appear on the graduate career portion of the UW–Madison transcript nor count towards the graduate career GPA.\n\n\n\n\n**Prior Graduate Coursework from Other Institution(s)\n** Coursework from Undergraduate Career at UW–Madison (up to 7 credits total)\n**Transfer from University Special Student Career at UW–Madison (up to 15 credits total)\n\n\nMinimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement\nNo\nNo\n*Allowed up to 15 credits numbered 300 or above\n\n\nMinimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement\n*Allowed\n*Allowed up to 7 credits numbered 300 or above\n *Allowed up to 15 credits numbered 300 or above\n\n\nMinimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement\n*Allowed\n*Allowed up to 7 credits numbered 700 or above\n*Allowed up to 15 credits numbered 700 or above\n\n\n\n*Fulfillment of requirements is allowed in these instances only if approved by the student’s graduate program.\n**Coursework earned five or more years prior to admission to a master’s degree or coursework earned ten or more years prior to admission to a doctoral degree is not allowed to satisfy requirements.\nPrograms may decide to count previous graduate work from another institute toward fulfillment of degree credit requirements; however, this work will not appear on a UW–Madison transcript, and it does not count toward the Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence credit or graduate coursework (50%) requirements.\nPrior coursework can be used toward the minor requirement in accordance with the Prior Coursework policy chart.\nThe credits used towards a master’s degree and the prior coursework used toward it may also be applied to a related doctoral degree. However, if the prior coursework credit maximums were already reached for the master’s degree (seven UW–Madison undergraduate credits and/or fifteen University Special student credits), then no more prior coursework credits are permissible for the doctoral degree.\nStudents should be aware that some programs may require more rigorous credit requirements than the Graduate School’s minimum requirements. Students should contact their graduate program coordinator for further information.\nSee Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement\n• Probation\n\nMore\n\n\n\nStudents must be in good academic standing with the Graduate School, their program, and their advisor. The Graduate School regularly reviews the record of any student who received grades of BC, C, D, F, or I in courses numbered 300 or above, or grades of U in research and thesis. This review could result in academic probation with a hold on future enrollment, and the student may be suspended from graduate studies.\nThe Graduate School requires that students maintain a minimum graduate GPA of 3.00 in courses taken as a graduate student (excluding research, audit, credit/no credit, and pass/fail courses). The Graduate School also considers Incomplete (I) grades to be unsatisfactory if they are not removed during the subsequent semester of enrollment; however, the instructor may impose an earlier deadline. The Graduate School may also put students on probation for incompletes not cleared within one term. All incomplete grades must be resolved before a degree is granted.\nIf students were admitted on probation and they satisfy the conditions outlined at the time of admission, probationary status will be removed automatically. Once their studies have begun, students are expected to make satisfactory progress toward their degree.\nSee Grade Point Average (GPA) Requirement, Holds, Incompletes, Satisfactory Progress, Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) Grades\n• Programs (or ‘Majors’)\n\nMore\n\n\n\nPrograms are officially approved courses of study and research leading to a master’s or doctoral degree. They may be administered from within a disciplinary department or across departments by an interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary cluster of faculty. Some programs have official areas of concentration within them (called Named Options or Subplans) at the master’s and/or doctoral levels. Both programs and named options appear on the student’s transcript. Some programs have unofficial tracks, specializations, or concentrations but these are not listed on the transcript. Contact the program’s graduate coordinator for more information.\nStudents who would like to pursue an individual program different from approved programs should see Special Graduate Committee Degrees.\nSee Applying to Add/Change Program, Plan, Certificate or Named Option, Change of Degree Level (Plan) or Degree Named Option (Sub-Major), Doctoral Minors, Special Graduate Committee Degrees\n• Progress (P) Grades\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe P is an abbreviation for “Progress,” not an abbreviation for “Pass.” It is a temporary grade. Grades of P (except for research and thesis within the program) must be changed before a degree or preliminary exam warrant can be issued.\nIf a P is assigned for research courses numbered 790, 890, and 990, the grade will remain until the faculty member assigns a grade of S or U. All previously assigned P grades in that instructor’s research course will revert to an S or U upon assignment of the S or U grade. Usually this is upon assignment of the final grade for the course in the semester of submitting the dissertation. (All grades for 790, 890, 990 that are unreported by the end of the grading period will be automatically assigned a P.)\nSee Grading System, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, No Report (NR) Grades\n• Project or Program Assistant (PA)\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThese titles designate graduate or professional students employed to assist with research, training, or other academic programs or projects. Contact the employing department directly for more information.\nThe Graduate Assistant Policies and Procedures (GAPP) outline employment-related practices for graduate student project assistants.\nSee Concurrent Appointments for Fellows/Trainees, Enrollment Requirements, Maximum Levels of Appointments, Tuition Remission, Payroll Benefits for Graduate Assistants, Fellows, and Trainees\n• Qualifying Examination\n\nMore\n\n\n\nQualifying examination requirements differ for each program. Students should contact their program to learn about specific requirements.\nSee Preliminary Examinations\n• Readmission to Graduate School (for previously enrolled graduate students)\n\nMore\n\n\n\nIf graduate students do not continuously enroll during a fall or spring semester, they are required to apply for readmission to the Graduate School through the online application. The readmission process accomplishes two goals: (1) assures the Graduate School that graduate students are in good standing with their academic program; and (2) activates their enrollment eligibility. Further information about readmission for previously enrolled graduate students can be found here. To apply for readmission, graduate students must also contact their program for further details of the readmission process at the program level.\nA returning student who is completing another same level degree within five years must comply with double degree requirements, including the 25% overlap rule.\nAny student being readmitted to a graduate program must adhere to the requirements in the most current Academic Policies & Procedures and Graduate Guide.\nSee Double Degrees, Effective Dates, International Students Maintaining Legal Status, Leave of Absence, Time Limits\n• Repeating Courses\n\nMore\n\n\n\nTypically, courses where content can change (such as special topics, seminars, independent studies, and research and thesis) can be repeated within the semester or on a semester basis. Repeated courses may earn course credit and satisfy the Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence, degree, and coursework (50%) credit requirements. Sometimes program authorization is necessary for enrollment.\nStudents are entitled to repeat any didactic course if they or their program feel it is necessary. Both grades will be used in calculating the student’s graduate grade-point average; however, the course will count only once toward the Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence, degree, and coursework (50%) credit requirements.\nSee Failure, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Satisfactory Progress, Appendix 4 – Grade-Point Average Calculation\n• Research Assistant (RA)\n\nMore\n\n\n\nA Research Assistant (RA) must be a graduate student working toward a master’s or doctoral degree. Research Assistants are UW–Madison graduate students who are given stipends to support their own education and training. RAs should not be given work assignments unrelated to their own educational pursuits – graduate assistants with significant duties unrelated to their own course of study should be appointed as a PA rather than an RA.\nThe program will give consideration for an RA appointment based on information provided in the application for admission or, in some cases, in a specific program application form. Research Assistants will receive a letter of appointment or reappointment each semester or year they hold their assistantship. If appointed students have not received such a letter, they should contact their payrolling office.\nNote that the RA appointment percentage is merely a mechanism for setting the stipend amount, and does not correlate to any particular requirement for hours of work. The maximum appointment percentage is 50%. However, to account for the potential that RAs may occasionally perform duties that are not directly related to their course of study, the university has deemed an RA appointment to entail 5 hours of compensated employment per week. In no event may an RA be asked to perform more than 5 hours per week of work unrelated to their course of study, regardless of percentage of RA appointment.\nThe Graduate Assistant Policies and Procedures (GAPP) outline employment-related practices for graduate student research assistants.\nSee Enrollment Requirements, Maximum Levels of Appointments\n• Residence for Tuition Purposes\n\nMore\n\n\n\nWisconsin Statute 36.27(2) governs resident status for tuition purposes. To be eligible for in-state tuition, a student must be a bona fide resident of Wisconsin for at least the 12 months immediately prior to enrollment, or must qualify as a resident for tuition purposes under one of the provisions in the Statutes that waives the 12-month requirement. In determining resident status for tuition purposes, standards are different from those used for voting, paying taxes, etc.\nIf students are classified as nonresident for tuition purposes, they do not automatically become residents for tuition purposes after residing in Wisconsin for one or more years. In cases where it appears the students have entered and remained in Wisconsin principally for educational purposes, a presumption is made that they continue to reside outside the state. The presumption of non-residence continues in effect until rebutted by clear and convincing evidence of bona fide residence.\nProvisions of the statute under which a student may qualify as a resident for tuition purposes without waiting 12 months are:\n\nThe student is a graduate of a Wisconsin high school and has a parent who has been a bona fide resident of Wisconsin for the 12 months preceding the beginning of any term of enrollment or whose last surviving parent was a bona fide resident of this state for the 12 months preceding death;\nThe student, a spouse, or parent (of which they are claimed as a tax dependent), has moved to Wisconsin for a job transfer or for new employment that was accepted before moving and before the student applied to this university. The employment needs to continue full-time with the same employer, and the student needs to demonstrate an intent to establish and maintain their permanent home in Wisconsin;\nOne of the student’s parents is a bona fide resident of Wisconsin, and the student is a tax dependent of one of the parents.\n\nFind more information about residence for tuition purposes and the full text of the applicable statute on the Office of the Registrar’s Residence for Tuition Purposes webpage. Students with questions about residence for tuition purposes, or who believe they should be a resident and would like to appeal the nonresident tuition status, may contact the Office of the Registrar’s Residence Counselors.\n• The student is a graduate of a Wisconsin high school and has a parent who has been a bona fide resident of Wisconsin for the 12 months preceding the beginning of any term of enrollment or whose last surviving parent was a bona fide resident of this state for the 12 months preceding death;\n• The student, a spouse, or parent (of which they are claimed as a tax dependent), has moved to Wisconsin for a job transfer or for new employment that was accepted before moving and before the student applied to this university. The employment needs to continue full-time with the same employer, and the student needs to demonstrate an intent to establish and maintain their permanent home in Wisconsin;\n• One of the student’s parents is a bona fide resident of Wisconsin, and the student is a tax dependent of one of the parents.\n• Responsible Conduct of Research\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe various areas of responsible conduct of research and associated policies are described below. For more information, see this comprehensive document regarding UW–Madison Research Safety and Compliance Training Requirements and the Research Policy and Compliance Checklist.\nAnimal Care and Use in Research\nUW–Madison has federal compliance responsibilities that pertain to the use of live, vertebrate animals in research, teaching, and outreach activities. This includes but is not limited to traditional basic and applied research models, instruction of students, and public events. Oversight and evaluation of the humane and ethical use of animals is performed by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUCs). The Research Animal Resource Center (RARC) provides support to the IACUCs and training to animal users necessary to provide the highest quality care and compliance for the university’s research animals. Learn more about the rules and regulations governing the care and use of research animals, how to prepare and submit animal care and use protocols to IACUCs, and how to obtain veterinary and pathology services at the Research Animal Resources Center webpage. Training and protocol approval are required before one can begin research projects involving animals.\nAuthorship\nAuthors of a research publication are usually those who provide meaningful intellectual contribution to a project in one or more of the following ways: concept, design, supervision, resources, materials, data collection and processing, analysis or interpretation, literature search and writing. Many academic journals may list very specific requirements for authorship. All authors have rights and responsibilities thus any person listed as an author should be knowledgeable and aware of such. Unless the contributions of the co-authors are listed, each author takes full responsibility for the contents of the work. When asked to serve as a publication reviewer, students should treat this material as confidential. See further information about authorship, publication and peer review.\nConflict of Interest\nThe Conflict of Interest (COI) staff and committee review reports of outside activities and financial interests to comply with federal, state, and university regulations and policies. This committee also works with faculty and staff to eliminate, minimize, or manage any actual or potential financial conflicts of interest identified by the reporting process. For further information see the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research’s Conflict of Interest guidance document and Outside Activities Reporting webpage.\nHuman Research Protections\nIn accordance with federal regulations and UW–Madison policies, all research involving human subjects must be reviewed and approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) prior to any research intervention with participants. All graduate research involving human subjects for inclusion in a master’s thesis or doctoral dissertation must be approved by an IRB before beginning the research. Training is required before a project is submitted to an IRB for review. For additional information, see the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research Human Research Protection Program webpage. For additional information visit the Institutional Review Board webpage.\nIntellectual Property Rights\nExcept as required by funding agreements or other university policies, the university does not claim ownership rights in the intellectual property generated during research by its faculty, staff, or students. This policy has proven beneficial to the university, the public, and the creators of such property. In the case of inventions funded in whole or in part by a federal agency or in the case of sponsored research agreements that require the university to grant rights in inventions generated by funding under such agreements, faculty, staff, and students must assign rights to such invention to the university’s designated patent management organization, the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF). Faculty, staff, and students must execute all papers necessary to file patent applications on the invention and establish the federal government’s or other sponsor’s rights in the invention. If there are no specific written agreements or policies to the contrary, the researcher at the university is free to dispose of the rights in the manner of his or her own choosing. The university retains the right to use the products of research conducted as a university activity for its education and research mission. See information and forms for disclosing an invention or read more about intellectual property.\nMisconduct of Research\nGraduate education is carried in classrooms, laboratories and other research venues, and is often supported by federal or other external funding sources. Maintaining the integrity of academic and research efforts carried out at UW–Madison is an essential priority. At UW–Madison, graduate students are held to the same standards of responsible conduct of research as faculty and staff. Misconduct in scholarly research is defined as fabrication (making up data), falsification (changing or misreporting data), plagiarism (representing work of others as your own), or other practices that seriously deviate from those that are commonly accepted within the scholarly community for proposing, conducting, or reporting research. For more information, see the overview of Misconduct in Scholarly Research and Faculty Legislation II-314: Misconduct in Scholarly Research. The Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research is responsible for investigating allegations of research misconduct. For more information, contact the Associate Vice Chancellor for Research Policy and Integrity.\nReporting Wrongdoing, Non-compliance or Research Misconduct\nThe University of Wisconsin-Madison strives to foster the highest scholarly and ethical standards among its students, faculty, and staff. As a recipient of federal funding, the University of Wisconsin must comply with federal laws related to civil rights, animal welfare research misconduct, and others. Though extremely rare, we realize there are times when reportable events of wrongdoing, noncompliance, or misconduct may occur in our midst and that it is our responsibility as an academic community to take steps to rectify them. See the Whistleblower Protection Policy and the policy on Obligations and Protections for Graduate Students.\nPatents\nA patent is an exclusive statutory right available to the inventor or inventors of new material. As inventors, students may have the right to seek patent protection for their invention (for example, for a product that results from the research documented in their dissertation).\nIf students have received support (for example, an appointment as a Research Assistant or Project Assistant) for the work leading to an invention, or used any other university funding, supplies, equipment, or university premises, in the work leading to an invention, they may have obligations that affect their rights to seek patent protection for an invention. It is important to discuss patents with their advisor. Also, students should review the Intellectual Property Policy for Research.\nResearch Regulatory Compliance\nIf students’ research involves human subjects (including data sets, surveys, human blood, or other body materials), live animals, recombinant DNA, infectious agents, stem cells, or biological toxins, they should consult the Research Ethics webpage.\nSafety\nBiological Safety\nThe Office of Biological Safety (OBS) assists faculty, students, and staff in observing safe practices in research in the biological sciences as prescribed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and endeavors to ensure that research is done in secure facilities in compliance with all local, state, and federal regulations. As an institution receiving NIH research funds, UW–Madison is subject to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules (rDNA). OBS provides the administrative mechanism by which research involving rDNA can be reviewed, thereby assuring compliance with the NIH guidelines. This institution adheres to the guidance of the CDC/NIH publication, Biosafety in Biomedical and Microbiological Laboratories. Institutional policies are described in the UW–Madison Researchers’ Biosafety Manual.\nChemical Safety\nThe UW–Madison Chemical Safety Office, working in conjunction with the campus Chemical Safety Committee, establishes policies and procedures for the safe acquisition, use, storage, and disposal of chemicals on campus. The Chemical Safety Office also advises campus chemical users on best practices and helps the university community comply with federal, state, and local chemical and environmental safety laws. See the Office of Chemical Safety website for additional information.\nRadiation Safety\nThe UW–Madison Office of Radiation Safety provides training on the safe use and handling of radioactive materials, which includes ordering, use, disposal, spill cleanup, and shipping for those employees who will need to ship radioactive materials. The Office of Radiation Safety also provides shielding assessments and dosimetry to those users who require it. Additionally, training on safe use of x-ray generating equipment and lasers is also available. See the Office of Radiation Safety website for additional information.\n• Satisfactory Academic Progress\n\nMore\n\n\n\nContinuation in the Graduate School is at the discretion of a student’s program, the Graduate School, and a student’s faculty advisor.  A student may be placed on probation or dismissed from the Graduate School for not maintaining satisfactory academic progress.  In special cases the Graduate School permits students who do not meet these minimum standards to continue on probation upon recommendation and support of their advisor.\nThe Graduate School sets minimum standards that all graduate students in the university must meet. Many departments and programs have additional requirements that exceed these Graduate School minimum requirements. The definition of satisfactory progress varies by program.\nMost programs require satisfactory progress to continue guaranteed funding support.\nThe Graduate Guide includes the Graduate School’s minimum degree requirements and satisfactory progress chart, as well as each program’s minimum degree requirements and satisfactory progress chart.\nIn determining satisfactory academic progress, the Graduate School monitors the following: cumulative grade point average, incomplete grades, English as a second language for some international students, the grades of students admitted on probationary status, enrollment in minimum required credits (underload), and unsatisfactory (U) grades.  Detailed information for each is below.\nLow cumulative GPA\nGraduate students must meet the Graduate School’s minimum 3.0 cumulative GPA in order to graduate. Some probationary admission conditions may require higher grades. When a graduate student’s cumulative GPA drops below a 3.0 for one semester, we notify them via email (copy to grad coordinator) that they are placed on academic probation, and we place a GSD LGR enrollment hold on the following semester. They cannot continue enrolling until the probationary semester’s grades are reported and their cumulative GPA is above a 3.0.\nIf a student is placed on probation due to low GPA, they receive an email notification with the graduate coordinator copied.\nIncomplete (I) grades\nIf graduate students have not resolved incompletes by the end of the subsequent semester of enrollment, these grades are considered unsatisfactory. Graduate students are not permitted to graduate with incomplete grades on their record. The Graduate School issues warnings for incompletes that have not yet lapsed into bad standing, and for three or less credits of incompletes. The Graduate School places student on academic probation for having more than three credits of incompletes in bad standing and uses the GSD INC service indicator (enrollment hold) to ensure that this requirement is met before continued enrollment is permitted.\nIf a student is placed on probation due to incompletes, he/she receives an email notification with the graduate coordinator copied.\nESL required at admission to the Graduate School\nInternational graduate students may be required to take the ESLAT upon arrival at UW-Madison. This requirement applies to the following test scores: TOEFL (paper-based) test score is below 580; TOEFL computer based test (CBT) score below 237; (TOEFL internet based iBT) test score below 92; IELTS score below 7; or MELAB below 82. The ESLAT is administered by the English as a Second Language Program (Sandy Arfa, Director). ESLAT results may indicate that a graduate student is exempt from taking an ESL course, or these results may indicate a recommended ESL course. Graduate students for whom the ESLAT was required and who are not exempt based on the test results must enroll in the recommended ESL course during their first semester at UW-Madison. The Graduate School monitors successful completion of the ESL course for these students. The GSD ESL service indicator (enrollment hold) ensures that this requirement is met before continued enrollment is permitted.\nAdmit on probation\nApplicants who do not meet Graduate School admissions requirements may be admitted on probation, with program recommendation and GS Dean’s approval. They are admitted as G17 or G18 (probationary admit) codes, and receive an admission letter from the Graduate School, as well as message in OASIS, that notifies them they are being admitted on probation. These cases are monitored closely to ensure that the students achieve a 3.0 GPA during their first semester of enrollment. A hold is placed (GSD ADT), which prohibits them from enrolling in the following semester classes until their first semester grades are reported and the GPA is above a 3.0.\nUnderload (1 credit)\nGraduate students are required to enroll in a minimum of 2 graded, graduate-level credits each fall and spring semester. Those who are enrolled in only 1 credit each fall and spring semester are notified by the GS that they are under-enrolled. They are required to correct their enrollment immediately, and a GSD UNL hold is placed on their record, prohibiting them from enrolling in the subsequent term, until they meet the minimum enrollment requirement.\nUnsatisfactory (U) grades\nIf a course has been structured to offer the S/U grading option (such as research), a grade of S in that course would mean a grade of B or better. The Graduate School monitors U grades. Since these grades are very rare, cases are handled individually. Upon identification of a graduate student with a U grade in research, we contact the faculty advisor to find out more about the situation. GSD LGR holds are not automatically placed for U grades but may be if necessary.\n \n \nSee Grade Point Average (GPA) Requirement, Incompletes, Probation\n• Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) Grades\n\nMore\n\n\n\nFor all courses listed as research, the only permissible grades are Satisfactory (S), Unsatisfactory (U), and Progress (P). Though an Incomplete (I) grade may be assigned, a final grade must be submitted during the following term. If a P grade is assigned, it will remain until the instructor assigns a grade of S or U; all previously assigned P grades should revert to an S or U upon assignment of the final grade in most cases. These courses will not count in the student’s graduate Grade Point Average (GPA).\nResearch courses are traditionally reserved for graduate students; however, other students (Law, Medical, Undergraduate, etc.) occasionally register for a research course. In these cases the student’s college can decide to have the course count in the GPA with an academic action to the Registrar’s Office.\nIf a course has been structured to offer the S/U grading option, a grade of S in that course would mean a grade of B or better. S/U courses are not computed into the grade-point average. They may however satisfy the Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence, degree, and coursework (50%) credit requirements as well as the minor course credit and in considering the minimum or maximum credit load per term. The S/U grading option is not to be confused with the pass/fail option. Unsatisfactory grades do not satisfy any Graduate School’s minimum credit requirements. Programs and the Graduate School monitor students for unsatisfactory grades. Advisor holds may be placed for students with unsatisfactory grades.\nThe use of letter grades (A through F) is encouraged and recommended whenever information on performance permits. Courses designated as research require grading on the S/U basis. In certain seminars and advanced topics courses, where lack of examinations and other performance criteria makes the A-F scale inappropriate, use of the S/U option is permissible.\nSee Grade Point Average (GPA) Requirement, Incompletes, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Pass/Fail, Probation, Progress (P) Grades\n• Schedule of Classes\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe Schedule of Classes is available on the Course Search and Enroll App, and students can access the Schedule of Classes via their MyUW Student Center. The Schedule of Classes can be viewed using class search, the real-time online listing of course sections offered each term. Students are responsible for complying with enrollment deadlines, available at the Office of the Registrar’s Enrollment Deadlines.\nSee Authorization for Courses, Enrollment Accountability\n• Schools and Colleges, Graduate Degrees\n\nMore\n\n\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin–Madison Schools and Colleges\nCollege of Agricultural and Life Sciences\nWisconsin School of Business\nSchool of Education\nCollege of Engineering\nGraduate School\nSchool of Human Ecology\nLaw School\nCollege of Letters and Science\nSchool of Medicine and Public Health\nSchool of Nursing\nNelson Institute for Environmental Studies\nSchool of Pharmacy\nSchool of Veterinary Medicine\nDegrees Granted by the University of Wisconsin–Madison Graduate School\nMaster of Accountancy (MAcc)\nMaster of Arts (MA)\nMaster of Business Administration (MBA)\nMaster of Engineering (MEng)\nMaster of Fine Arts (MFA)\nMaster of French Studies (MFS)\nMaster of International Public Affairs (MIPA)\nMaster of Music (MM)\nMaster of Public Affairs (MPA)\nMaster of Science (MS)\nMaster of Social Work (MSW)\nEducational Specialist in School Psychology (EdS)\nDoctor of Audiology (AuD)\nDoctor of Musical Arts (DMA)\nDoctor of Nursing Practice (DNP)\nDoctor of Occupational Therapy (OTD)\nDoctor of Philosophy (PhD)\nFor a list of programs and degrees offered by each department, see UW–Madison Graduate Academic Programs. Also see the current Graduate Guide.\nUW–Madison offers a number of post-baccalaureate professional degrees that are not administered by the Graduate School, but instead are solely supported by their home school. See Other Professional Degrees.\n• Section Changes\n\nMore\n\n\n\nSection changes include: changes in Lectures, Discussions, Labs and Instructors’ course numbers for research or independent study courses for which students are already enrolled. Always consult the Office of the Registrar for deadlines and procedures for section changes.\nIf a student’s name does not appear on the appropriate instructor’s grade roster at the end of the term, a Course Change Request to change sections and a letter of request from the instructor of the class must be submitted to the Graduate School Office of Academic Services. The instructor of the correct section must submit a Grade Change Form to assign a grade. The instructor of the incorrect section should submit no grade.\nSee Course Changes, Grade Change\n• Sexual Harassment\n\nMore\n\n\n\nUW–Madison prohibits sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking. These offenses violate UW–Madison policies and are subject to disciplinary action. Sanctions can range from reprimand to expulsion from UW–Madison. In many cases, these offenses also violate Wisconsin criminal law and could lead to arrest and criminal prosecution.\nStudents who experience sexual harassment, sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and/or stalking have many options and services available to them on and off campus, including mental health counseling, victim advocacy and access to the criminal and campus disciplinary systems. For a list a confidential support and reporting options, please visit University Health Services.\nAll students are encouraged to report harassment of any kind, whether it is by a faculty or staff member or another student. Students may contact the Office of Student Assistance and Support: visit 70 Bascom Hall, email OSAS@studentaffairs.wisc.edu, call 608-263-5700 and ask to speak to the Dean on Call, or fill out a Bias Incident Reporting Form.\nFaculty, staff, teaching assistants, and others who work directly with students at UW–Madison are required by law to report first-hand knowledge or disclosures of sexual assault to university officials for statistical purposes. In addition, disclosures made to certain university employees, such as academic advisors or university administrators, may be forwarded to the campus Title IX coordinator for a response. For more information, visit the Office of Student Assistance and Support’s Sexual Assault, Dating and Domestic Violence webpage.\nGraduate students are expected to complete an online violence prevention program. Read more about the violence prevention program for graduate students.\nSee Grievances and Appeals\n• Special Graduate Committee Degrees\n\nMore\n\n\n\nSpecial graduate committee degrees are one-of-a-kind degrees built around unique needs of individual students that cannot be satisfied by approved programs (e.g., by existing major program/minor combinations, joint degrees, distributed minors, etc.) and may permit individual degrees in new and emerging fields or combinations of disciplines. A higher degree of independence is required on the part of the student, since easily available guidance provided by programs is often more difficult to obtain, and there is not the usual collegial group of students in closely related research and coursework.\nThe master’s and doctoral special graduate committee guidelines are:\n\nProspective students who may have an interest in a special graduate committee degree should apply to the degree program that is closest to their program interest.\nUpon receipt of an application on which a prospective student has expressed interest in a special graduate committee degree, the program will follow all relevant program admission requirements.\nStudents may not be admitted directly to a special graduate committee degree program. They must be accepted for admission by an established department or program and be attending classes at UW–Madison before a proposal for a special graduate committee degree will be considered by the Graduate School.\nThe department or program admitting the student must be prepared to see the student through an established degree program. No commitments are made to provide a special graduate committee degree until after the student is enrolled and the proposal for the special degree and the student’s ability at the graduate level have been evaluated and approved.\nThe student’s advisor authors and submits the special graduate committee degree proposal on behalf of the student as early in the student’s program as possible. Proposals submitted after a substantial portion of the program has been completed will not be accepted. Doctoral proposals must be submitted by the end of the first year of graduate work. Master’s proposals must be submitted after the equivalent of the first full-time semester of graduate work. The proposal should consist of the following elements:\n\nThe reasons the special graduate committee program is needed and an explanation of why the student’s needs cannot be met within existing programs.\nThe exact title of the proposed degree program (which should be brief and descriptive).\nThe proposed course and seminar program of graduate work on this campus. Include the course title, program, course number, credits, grade, and semester taken/to be taken.\nAny specific requirements of the dissertation or thesis (language, equipment, etc.).\nThe nature and scope of preliminary examinations for the doctoral degree, or the examination procedure for the master’s degree.\nThe nature of the dissertation or thesis (general subject area).\nThe names of the faculty members who, in addition to the advisor, are willing to share the responsibility of supervising the student’s program. Including the advisor, the doctoral degree requires 4 members (including 3 UW–Madison graduate faculty members), and the master’s degree requires 3 members (including 2 UW–Madison graduate faculty members). Approval signatures of the committee members are required on the proposal.\n\n\nThe Graduate School will carefully review proposals to determine whether or not the program can be carried out within an established department or program, joint degrees, appropriate use of minors, or other available mechanisms. The suitability and degree of commitment of the committee for the proposed program will be examined.\nThe chairperson of the committee (usually the advisor) should be a member of the program to which the student originally had been admitted. That program should remain the keeper of the student’s records and should make all appropriate nominations for financial aid.\nThe Graduate School is concerned about maintaining active participation by all members of special degree committees in the ongoing program of the student and asks the individual members of the committee to assume program responsibilities provided institutionally in a conventional program. Faculty members who are willing to serve on these committees should be prepared to participate fully in all aspects of the student’s program from the beginning, especially where they must provide the necessary expertise in their particular areas of interest.\n\nSee Committees (Doctoral/Master’s)\n• Prospective students who may have an interest in a special graduate committee degree should apply to the degree program that is closest to their program interest.\n• Upon receipt of an application on which a prospective student has expressed interest in a special graduate committee degree, the program will follow all relevant program admission requirements.\n• Students may not be admitted directly to a special graduate committee degree program. They must be accepted for admission by an established department or program and be attending classes at UW–Madison before a proposal for a special graduate committee degree will be considered by the Graduate School.\n• The department or program admitting the student must be prepared to see the student through an established degree program. No commitments are made to provide a special graduate committee degree until after the student is enrolled and the proposal for the special degree and the student’s ability at the graduate level have been evaluated and approved.\n• The student’s advisor authors and submits the special graduate committee degree proposal on behalf of the student as early in the student’s program as possible. Proposals submitted after a substantial portion of the program has been completed will not be accepted. Doctoral proposals must be submitted by the end of the first year of graduate work. Master’s proposals must be submitted after the equivalent of the first full-time semester of graduate work. The proposal should consist of the following elements:\n\nThe reasons the special graduate committee program is needed and an explanation of why the student’s needs cannot be met within existing programs.\nThe exact title of the proposed degree program (which should be brief and descriptive).\nThe proposed course and seminar program of graduate work on this campus. Include the course title, program, course number, credits, grade, and semester taken/to be taken.\nAny specific requirements of the dissertation or thesis (language, equipment, etc.).\nThe nature and scope of preliminary examinations for the doctoral degree, or the examination procedure for the master’s degree.\nThe nature of the dissertation or thesis (general subject area).\nThe names of the faculty members who, in addition to the advisor, are willing to share the responsibility of supervising the student’s program. Including the advisor, the doctoral degree requires 4 members (including 3 UW–Madison graduate faculty members), and the master’s degree requires 3 members (including 2 UW–Madison graduate faculty members). Approval signatures of the committee members are required on the proposal.\n• The reasons the special graduate committee program is needed and an explanation of why the student’s needs cannot be met within existing programs.\n• The exact title of the proposed degree program (which should be brief and descriptive).\n• The proposed course and seminar program of graduate work on this campus.

The Specialist Certificate represents work beyond the master’s level. In addition to program requirements, the Graduate School requires that the student must meet all Graduate School minimum degree and satisfactory progress requirements as listed in the Graduate School’s Minimum Degree Requirements and Satisfactory Progress chart in the Graduate Guide.\nFor additional information, contact the programs that offer the Specialist Certificates.\nSee Enrollment Requirements, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Transfer Credits for Prior Coursework, Time Limits\n• Study Abroad\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe university creates an international context for education by providing opportunities for UW–Madison students to study overseas. Because of the variety of programs, students should coordinate their study abroad program with their graduate program, the Graduate School, and International Academic Programs (IAP).\nStudents intending to study abroad through a UW–Madison approved study abroad program can learn more about their options through International Academic Programs.\nGraduate students who are interested in conducting research abroad can register for IAP’s UW Graduate Research, which allows students to stay continuously registered as UW–Madison students, receive research credit with their faculty advisor, international health insurance, and 24/7 emergency assistance through IAP. This is an individualized experience and is not tied to a specific study abroad program. Students will need to have a high degree of independence in arranging housing and logistics for themselves.\nAll graduate students traveling abroad are encouraged to acquire insurance through Cultural Insurance Services International.\nSee Fellowships, Insurance and Medical Benefits\n• Teaching Assistant (TA)\n\nMore\n\n\n\nMany programs offer Teaching Assistantships. This title is appropriate for graduate students who have been assigned teaching responsibilities in an instructional program under the supervision of a faculty member of the academic staff. Contact the employing program directly for more information about the TA position.\nThe Graduate Assistant Policies and Procedures (GAPP) outline employment-related practices for graduate student teaching assistants.\nSee Enrollment Requirements, Maximum Levels of Appointments, Teaching Assistant (TA) Orientation and Training, Tuition Remission, Payroll Benefits for Graduate Assistants, Fellows, and Trainees\n• Thesis (Masters)\n\nMore\n\n\n\nSome master’s degrees require a thesis to be deposited in the Memorial Library. The Graduate School produces materials that describe the preparation of a thesis. See the Graduate School’s guide to Completing Your Master’s Degree.\nSee Dissertation and Thesis Standards and Publishing\n• Time Limits\n\nMore\n\n\n\nGraduate degrees are awarded, in part, for completion of current coursework. Students who break enrollment from their graduate program may risk losing all credits earned prior to their absence.\nMaster’s degree: students who have been absent for five or more consecutive years lose all credits that they have earned before their absence.\nDoctoral degree: students who have been absent for ten or more consecutive years lose all credits that they have earned before their absence.\nIndividual programs may count the coursework students completed prior to their absence for meeting program requirements; however that coursework will not count toward Graduate School credit requirements. Although the program may count the coursework students did before their absence towards the program requirements, the Graduate School does not count that work toward the Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence, degree, and coursework (50%) credit requirements.\nA candidate for a doctoral degree who fails to take the final oral examination and deposit the dissertation within 5 years after passing the preliminary examination may be required to take another preliminary examination and to be admitted to candidacy a second time.\nA student’s program may appeal these time limits through a written request to the Graduate School Degree Coordinator. The appeal must provide information demonstrating that the student has remained current in the field of study. This information may include a resume showing applicable work experience and/or official transcripts from other schools attended.\nSee Effective Dates, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Preliminary Examinations, Readmission to Graduate School (for previously enrolled graduate students)\n• Transfer of Graduate Work from Other Institutions\n\nMore\n\n\n\nUnder the Prior Coursework policy, a student’s program may decide to accept graduate coursework completed outside of the students graduate career at UW–Madison when those courses are rigorous and meet the expectations of a graduate work for the degree. Students should contact their program when inquiring about or attempting to transfer graduate work from other institutions. Coursework earned five or more years prior to admission to a master’s degree or coursework earned ten or more years prior to admission to a doctoral degree is not allowed to satisfy Graduate School minimum credit requirements. See the Satisfying Requirements with Prior Graduate Coursework from Other Institution(s) section of the Prior Coursework policy.\nSee Dean’s Approval, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Prior Coursework\n• Traveling Scholar Program\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe Big Ten Academic Alliance sponsors the Traveling Scholar Program as part of a continuing effort to increase cooperative use of its member institutions’ resources. This program enables doctoral-level students at any Big Ten Academic Alliance university to take advantage of educational opportunities (specialized courses, unique library collections, unusual laboratories) at any other Big Ten Academic Alliance university without additional tuition expenses. Find a list of member universities.\nCredits earned by Traveling Scholars are transferred by the home university upon receipt of transcript from the host university. Courses and grades are posted directly on a student’s UW–Madison transcript and, if graduate level, count toward the Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence, degree, and coursework credit requirements. Terms are limited to two semesters or three quarters regardless of the number of courses taken.\nStudents interested in the Traveling Scholars Program should contact the Graduate School Degree Coordinator for an application or more information.\nSee Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Transfer Credits for Prior Coursework\n• Tuition and Fee Information\n\nMore\n\n\n\nStudents go to their MyUW Student Center Tuition Account Summary to view their tuition charges, payments, financial aid, loans, scholarships and refunds; and to access links to set up an “Authorized Payer” and view, print, and pay eBills.\nThe tuition bill is provided as an eBill which is published to view, print, or pay online on the Tuition Account eBill/ePayment secure website. An email is sent to notify students and their Authorized Payers each time a new eBill is published. If students want their parents to have access to the website, students must first set them up as Authorized Payers. Detailed Authorized Payer information is available on the Bursar’s Office How to Add an Authorized Payer webpage.\nTuition and fee charges must be paid by the due date indicated on the tuition and fee statement to avoid a $100 late fee. (Late fee is subject to change.) UW–Madison does not accept debit or credit cards for tuition payment. Detailed payment options and information are available on the Bursar’s Office Payment Methods webpage. For tuition account questions or more information, contact the Bursar’s Office at: tuition@bussvc.wisc.edu (include the student name/ID in the email), or by phone: 608-262-3611.\nThe date a course is dropped or the date a student submits an online withdrawal request determines eligibility for a tuition adjustment. For tuition and fee adjustment and assessment questions, visit the Bursar’s Office Tuition Adjustment webpage or contact them at tuition@bussvc.wisc.edu. Find class drop deadlines, cost adjustments, tuition refund schedules plus other tuition and fees information on the Office of the Registrar’s Dates & Deadlines webpage.\nSee Tuition Remission, Withdrawal\n• Tuition Remission\n\nMore\n\n\n\nMost graduate students who have a Project Assistantship (PA), a Teaching Assistantship (TA), or a Research Assistantship (RA) of at least a 33% appointment for a fall or spring term are eligible to receive remission of full tuition.\nGraduate students enrolled in service-based pricing programs, such as online and accelerated programs, are ineligible to receive tuition remission. See a list of UW–Madison academic programs with service-based pricing (NetID login required).\nGraduate students should consult with their graduate programs and read their admission and appointment letters carefully to understand their benefits eligibility.\nFellowships that are payrolled through the university and carry stipends equivalent to at least a 33% Research Assistantship also qualify for remission of non-resident tuition.\nStudents should check with the payroll coordinator in their program to determine eligibility.\nAll graduate assistants are responsible for paying their segregated fees.\nTuition is remitted in summer sessions to graduate students in one of the following categories:\n\nThose continuing students who were granted remissions in the immediately-preceding Spring semester provided they held a teaching, research, or project assistantship (all tuition), or graduate fellowship (non-resident portion of tuition) and enroll in the summer session as graduate students;\nThose students who hold research, teaching, or project assistantship appointments, or fellowship appointments for the summer sessions, and who meet the criteria for remission established for the summer session.\n\nFor more information, visit the Bursar’s Office Tuition Remission webpage or view the Bursar’s Tuition Remissions Policy. For questions, contact the Bursar’s Office at remissions@bussvc.wisc.edu.\nSee Enrollment Requirements, Fellowships, Minnesota/Wisconsin Reciprocity, Project or Program Assistant (PA), Research Assistant (RA), Teaching Assistant (TA), Traineeships, Withdrawal, Payroll Benefits for Graduate Assistants, Fellows, and Trainees\n• Those continuing students who were granted remissions in the immediately-preceding Spring semester provided they held a teaching, research, or project assistantship (all tuition), or graduate fellowship (non-resident portion of tuition) and enroll in the summer session as graduate students;\n• Those students who hold research, teaching, or project assistantship appointments, or fellowship appointments for the summer sessions, and who meet the criteria for remission established for the summer session.\n• University Special Student Status\n\nMore\n\n\n\nStudents enrolled as University Special students are considered non-degree candidates and pay tuition and fees at the designated special student rate. See the Transfer Credits for Prior Coursework policy for information on how limited credits taken as a University Special Student may be accepted by a graduate program. Students are not allowed to simultaneously enroll as a graduate student and as a University Special student.\nBefore beginning a graduate program, an international student may choose to study full-time English as a University Special student on an F-1 visa granted through the ESL program or on a J-1 visa with the sponsor’s approval. When the student begins a graduate program, the student’s status will be changed from University Special student to graduate student.\nFor more information visit the Adult Career and Special Student Services website or contact them at advising@dcs.wisc.edu.\n• Variable Credit Courses\n\nMore\n\n\n\nSome didactic courses are offered to both undergraduate and graduate students. Typically undergraduate students enroll for a higher amount of total credits than do graduate students. Courses of this nature are designated in the Schedule of Classes as variable credit courses. Students should consult the Course Search and Enroll App to determine the appropriate credits when enrolling for a variable credit course.\n• Violence Prevention\n\nMore\n\n\n\nUniversity Health Services (UHS) has designed an online sexual violence prevention training program specifically for graduate students to promote the health and safety of the campus community by increasing understanding of sexual assault, harassment, dating and domestic violence, and stalking, as well as prevention strategies, resources, victim rights, and reporting options. Starting fall 2017, all new incoming graduate students, admitted summer 2017 or after, are required to complete the 45-minute online training program within their first semester. Failure to complete the training will result in probation and a registration hold.\nFor further information, review the Task Force on Sexual Violence and Harassment recommendations document, which was adopted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents in 2016. For questions, visit the violence prevention program website or email violenceprevention@uhs.wisc.edu.\n• Warrants\n\nMore\n\n\n\nA warrant is a program’s recommendation that a student be admitted to doctoral candidacy (a preliminary examination warrant) or be granted a degree (master’s or doctoral degree warrant).  Warrants are requested electronically by the Graduate Program Coordinator.  Once reviewed and approved by the Graduate School Degree Coordinator, the warrant serves as the Graduate School’s notification that a student has met both the Graduate School and program requirements with the exception for  degrees requiring a thesis/dissertation defense or final oral exam/exhibit. Approved warrants for doctoral degrees and master’s degrees requiring a thesis/dissertation defense or final oral exam/exhibit are made available to committee members for signature after evaluating the thesis/dissertation or final oral exam/exhibit.   If the committee decides the student has met this final requirement, the warrant is returned to the Graduate School for final review before the degree is approved (cleared) and awarded (posted).\nSee Certificate of Doctoral Candidacy, Dissertator Status, Dissertation Defense (Final Examination), Preliminary Examinations\n• Withdrawal\n\nMore\n\n\n\nWithdrawal indicates that a student intends to stop attending classes for the current semester. Submission of a withdrawal request in MyUW Student Center is required between the first and last day of the semester, when a student wishes to drop all classes in which they are enrolled for the current semester. Requests are then routed electronically to the Graduate School for review. Approval from the Graduate School, as well as from the Office of International Student Services for students on J-1 and F-1 visas, is required before a graduate student is formally withdrawn from the semester. For more information visit the Office of the Registrar’s Withdraw or Cancel Enrollment for a Term webpage.\nIf students drop all courses before the first day of classes, they officially cancel their enrollment, owe no tuition or fees for that term, and have no semester entry on their transcript. In this case, it is not necessary for the student to submit a withdrawal request to the Graduate School. Students planning to withdraw from their academic program should contact their program directly.\nStudents are considered enrolled for a term if they have courses on their record on or after the first day of classes for that term regardless of whether they have paid tuition and fees. Failure to attend classes or leaving the university informally does not excuse a student from having to pay tuition and fees. If students withdraw after the transcript deadline, a notation with the date of withdrawal will appear on the transcript. Enrollment deadlines are posted by the Office of the Registrar on their Enrollment Deadlines webpage.\nFailure to withdraw properly and promptly can be expensive. Before withdrawing, students should consult the Office of the Registrar’s Enrollment Deadlines webpage for specific deadlines and refund dates. If a student received financial aid from the university, they should consult the Office of Student Financial Aid to determine repayment responsibilities. If students withdraw and are receiving remission of tuition, they are responsible for their entire tuition assessment.\nSee Tuition and Fee Information, Tuition Remission\n• Because swap is a DROP and an ADD, the refund and assessment schedules and the dropped (DR) grade notation on the transcript deadline dates apply.\n• All session add/drop deadlines follow the Office of the Registrar’s Enrollment Deadlines.\n• Class eligibility controls and prerequisites will be adhered to. If the class is closed or a student is not eligible for that class, the swap will NOT occur.\n• Go to my.wisc.edu.\n• Enter your NetID login information.\n• Click on the tile “Graduate Student Portal”.

You also have the option to discontinue a program in which you are already enrolled.\n• The student is a graduate of a Wisconsin high school and has a parent who has been a bona fide resident of Wisconsin for the 12 months preceding the beginning of any term of enrollment or whose last surviving parent was a bona fide resident of this state for the 12 months preceding death;\n• The student, a spouse, or parent (of which they are claimed as a tax dependent), has moved to Wisconsin for a job transfer or for new employment that was accepted before moving and before the student applied to this university. The employment needs to continue full-time with the same employer, and the student needs to demonstrate an intent to establish and maintain their permanent home in Wisconsin;\n• One of the student’s parents is a bona fide resident of Wisconsin, and the student is a tax dependent of one of the parents.\n• Prospective students who may have an interest in a special graduate committee degree should apply to the degree program that is closest to their program interest.\n• Upon receipt of an application on which a prospective student has expressed interest in a special graduate committee degree, the program will follow all relevant program admission requirements.\n• Students may not be admitted directly to a special graduate committee degree program. They must be accepted for admission by an established department or program and be attending classes at UW–Madison before a proposal for a special graduate committee degree will be considered by the Graduate School.\n• The department or program admitting the student must be prepared to see the student through an established degree program. No commitments are made to provide a special graduate committee degree until after the student is enrolled and the proposal for the special degree and the student’s ability at the graduate level have been evaluated and approved.\n• The student’s advisor authors and submits the special graduate committee degree proposal on behalf of the student as early in the student’s program as possible. Proposals submitted after a substantial portion of the program has been completed will not be accepted. Doctoral proposals must be submitted by the end of the first year of graduate work. Master’s proposals must be submitted after the equivalent of the first full-time semester of graduate work. The proposal should consist of the following elements:\n\nThe reasons the special graduate committee program is needed and an explanation of why the student’s needs cannot be met within existing programs.\nThe exact title of the proposed degree program (which should be brief and descriptive).\nThe proposed course and seminar program of graduate work on this campus. Include the course title, program, course number, credits, grade, and semester taken/to be taken.\nAny specific requirements of the dissertation or thesis (language, equipment, etc.).\nThe nature and scope of preliminary examinations for the doctoral degree, or the examination procedure for the master’s degree.\nThe nature of the dissertation or thesis (general subject area).\nThe names of the faculty members who, in addition to the advisor, are willing to share the responsibility of supervising the student’s program. Including the advisor, the doctoral degree requires 4 members (including 3 UW–Madison graduate faculty members), and the master’s degree requires 3 members (including 2 UW–Madison graduate faculty members).

Approval signatures of the committee members are required on the proposal.\n• The Graduate School will carefully review proposals to determine whether or not the program can be carried out within an established department or program, joint degrees, appropriate use of minors, or other available mechanisms. The suitability and degree of commitment of the committee for the proposed program will be examined.\n• The chairperson of the committee (usually the advisor) should be a member of the program to which the student originally had been admitted. That program should remain the keeper of the student’s records and should make all appropriate nominations for financial aid.\n• The Graduate School is concerned about maintaining active participation by all members of special degree committees in the ongoing program of the student and asks the individual members of the committee to assume program responsibilities provided institutionally in a conventional program. Faculty members who are willing to serve on these committees should be prepared to participate fully in all aspects of the student’s program from the beginning, especially where they must provide the necessary expertise in their particular areas of interest.\n• The reasons the special graduate committee program is needed and an explanation of why the student’s needs cannot be met within existing programs.\n• The exact title of the proposed degree program (which should be brief and descriptive).\n• The proposed course and seminar program of graduate work on this campus.

Note some policies redirect to entries in the official UW–Madison Policy Library.\nThe Graduate School Office of Academic Services is the Academic Dean’s Office for all graduate students. Forms requiring the dean’s signature should be submitted to gsacserv@grad.wisc.edu (for example, course change form, audit form, credit overload request form). This office also monitors satisfactory progress toward degree completion.\nIn situations where policies have changed during a student’s time of enrollment, the Graduate School and the academic program, together with the student, may elect to enforce requirements that are in the best interest of the student. Please contact Academic Services with any questions regarding Graduate School procedures and policies. The Academic Policies and Procedures Glossary reflects current policies and procedures of the Graduate School, the Office of the Registrar, the Office of the Bursar, the International Students Services (ISS), and other university units.\nStudents who hold Graduate Assistant positions (TA, PA, and RA) can refer to Graduate Assistant Policies and Procedures (GAPP), available from the Office of Human Resources, for employment-related policies and practices.\n\n\n\n\nThis is an accordion element with a series of buttons that open and close related content panels.\n\nExpand allCollapse all\n\n\n      Statement on Diversity and Respect    \n\n\nDiversity is a source of strength, creativity, and innovation for UW–Madison. We value the contributions of each person and respect the profound ways their identity, culture, background, experience, status, abilities, and opinion enrich the university community. We commit ourselves to the pursuit of excellence in teaching, research, outreach, and diversity as inextricably linked goals.\nThe University of Wisconsin–Madison fulfills its public mission by creating a welcoming and inclusive community for people from every background—people who as students, faculty, and staff serve Wisconsin and the world.\nInquiries concerning this policy may be directed to the appropriate campus admitting or employing unit, to the Division of Diversity, Equity & Educational Achievement.\nCollapse all\n[GRID_TABLE]\nFull Text Search:\n\n\n\nCategory Filter:\nAll Categories\nEnrollment\nForms\nAcademic Progress\nDegree and Certificate Types\nGrading\nGrievance and Conduct\nTuition, Fees, and Funding\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd/Drop\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is a student’s responsibility to be aware of the add/drop deadlines each term. Consult the Office of the Registrar’s website for essential enrollment information and important deadlines. Courses may be added, dropped, or swapped through MyUW Student Center before and during the first two weeks of a semester (or the first week in the general 8-week summer session).\nIf a student drops a course, swaps out of a course, decreases credits in a variable credit course (via the “edit” function), or withdraws from the university, tuition and fee refunds are dispensed following a strict refund schedule. Modular courses and summer session courses have a shorter refund period.\nInternational students are not allowed to drop below full-time enrollment unless they have first received authorization from International Student Services (ISS). This will ensure that they remain in compliance with Department of Homeland Security (DHS) visa regulations. International students holding graduate assistantships, fellowships, and traineeships must meet minimum enrollment requirements. A reduced course load from ISS does not exempt graduate students holding assistantships, fellowships, and traineeships from these minimum enrollment requirements.\nIf students enroll for a course and do not attend, they must drop the class or receive a grade of NW (No Work) or, for audited classes, NR (No Report). If students make a course change after the fee refund deadlines (including audited, modular, and zero-credit courses), they may be charged a fee even if the total number of credits for which they are enrolled does not change. The Bursar’s Office will notify students if they owe additional fees or are entitled to a refund.\nStudents should be aware that “swap” is a drop action combined with an add action, allowing them to swap from one section to another section within the same course, or swap one course for another course. Some cautions related to swapping courses:\n\nBecause swap is a DROP and an ADD, the refund and assessment schedules and the dropped (DR) grade notation on the transcript deadline dates apply.\nAll session add/drop deadlines follow the Office of the Registrar’s Enrollment Deadlines.\nClass eligibility controls and prerequisites will be adhered to. If the class is closed or a student is not eligible for that class, the swap will NOT occur.\n\nFor more information and questions, contact the Office of the Registrar or Graduate School Office of Academic Services. Demos & Tutorials for course enrollment are available through the Office of the Registrar. For instructions on how to late add/change/drop a class, visit the Late Enrollment/Late Course Change/Late Drop section.\nSee Authorization for Courses, Course Changes, Credit Changes, Dean’s Approval, Enrollment Requirements, Exceptions, Late Enrollment/Late Course Change/Late Drop, Tuition and Fee Information, Withdrawal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvisor\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn advisor is a faculty member from the program responsible for providing advice regarding graduate studies and for supervising a student’s degree program (including research). An advisor—sometimes referred to as the major professor, mentor, or trainer—generally serves as chair of a student’s final examination committee.\nThe advisor/student relationship is one of mutual agreement, which may be terminated by either party. If a student changes advisors, they need to notify their program coordinator. It is the responsibility of every graduate student to have an advisor. If students do not have an advisor, the Graduate School may suspend them from further graduate study at UW–Madison until they find an advisor. However, in some cases, particularly for incoming students, the program may assign an advisor.\nWith approval from the program, students can have a co-advisor/co-chair. The co-advisor/co-chair may be from any of the following categories: graduate faculty, faculty from a department without a graduate program, academic staff (including emeritus faculty), visiting faculty, faculty from another institution, scientists, research associates, and other individuals deemed qualified by the program executive committee or its equivalent. Effective September 1, 2017, the co-advisor/co-chair will be designated on dissertation documentation.\nSee Committees (Doctoral/Master’s)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplying to Add/Change Program, Plan, Certificate or Named Option\n\nMore\n\n\n\nCurrently enrolled graduate students who want to apply to add, change, or discontinue a program of study, or add a certificate, do so through the Graduate Student Portal (in the MyGradPortal in MyUW).  An admissions application and fee are not required.\nStudents must check with the intended program concerning admission requirements (for example, letters of recommendation or statement of purpose) and eligibility. Upon receipt of a recommendation from the program, the Graduate School will notify the student of the decision. Note: Changing programs between a service based pricing program and a pooled program during a term are not allowed, so students should always indicate the next academic term when requesting to change between these types of programs. Adding minors, certificates, or discontinuing a program is allowed during a term. Questions regarding the status of an application are best directed to the program.\nIf dissertators want to add a program, typically a master’s program or a certificate program, they cannot concurrently hold dissertator fee status while pursuing the graduate degree or certificate. Dissertators who add a program or a certificate program will be removed from dissertator status and must enroll and pay fees as a regular graduate student.\nInternational students who add/change a program or a certificate program should contact International Student Services to discuss the possible effects this change of program could have on immigration status.\nSteps to Add/Change Program, Plan, or Named Option\nAccess MyUW and the Graduate Student Portal:\n\nGo to my.wisc.edu.\nEnter your NetID login information.\nClick on the tile “Graduate Student Portal”. If you do not see the tile, you can search for it in the top search bar and add it to your page.\n\nInitiating a request:\n\nOnce in your Portal page, select the tile on the home page titled “Add/Change Programs.”\nIn the “Enrolled Programs” section, you will have options to add a Graduate/Professional certificate, doctoral minor (PhD students only), or major. You also have the option to discontinue a program in which you are already enrolled.\nChoose an action button, which will display an associated window and show fields appropriate for the type of request.\nFill out the fields and click the “send” button to complete the initial request.\n\nThe request will show up as “In Review” in the Requests section on the Add/Change Programs page. Your Graduate Program Coordinator will follow up once your request is decided. More detailed instructions on this process, including example screenshots, can be found in the Add/Change/Discontinue Program Training.\nSee Change of Degree Level (Plan), Change of Degree Named Option, Dissertator Status, Named Option, Programs (or ‘Majors’)\n\n\n\n\nAssistantships\n\nMore\n\n\n\nDepartments/programs determine eligibility for most Teaching Assistantships (TAs), Research Assistantships (RAs), and Project/Program Assistantships (PAs). Other possible university appointments include fellowships, traineeships, reader/grader, and student hourly positions. Students should contact their program for information on how to obtain an assistantship.\nMore information can be found in the Payroll Benefits appendix.\nThe Graduate Assistant Policies and Procedures (GAPP) outline employment-related practices for graduate student teaching, research, and project assistants.\nSee Enrollment Requirements, Fellowships, Maximum Levels of Appointments, Project or Program Assistant (PA), Research Assistant (RA), Teaching Assistant (TA), Traineeships\n\n\n\n\nAttendance\n\nMore\n\n\n\nStudents should not attend classes without being enrolled. Faculty and instructors may require enrolled students to attend scheduled meetings of a class and/or to participate in other course-related activities, including online learning. Students are responsible for materials presented in such meetings or activities. Because courses are designed and conducted in diverse ways, faculty and instructors should inform students in writing at the beginning of each course if there are specific expectations for attendance/participation, including whether any component of the grade is based on such attendance/participation.\nSee Religious and Election Day Observances Policy and Guidelines in the Academic Calendar for more information.\n\n\n\n\nAuditing Courses\n\nMore\n\n\n\nA student auditing a course is expected to attend classes on a regular basis as an observer. Audits are not free; a course taken for audit costs the same as a course taken for credit. If students are not paying full-time fees, they will be assessed per-credit fees for an audit course. Auditors do not take examinations or submit class work. Auditors will receive a final grade of either S (Satisfactory) or NR (No Report). Audit courses do not satisfy any credit, coursework, or degree requirements, nor do they count in fulfilling minimum or maximum credits required in each term. Students holding assistantships and fellowships should be particularly aware of the enrollment requirement for their appointment, as audit requests will be denied if auditing the course would drop them below the required number of graded credits.  If students audit a course and do not attend or drop it, they will receive a grade of NR (No Report). Dissertators are not allowed to audit.  Dissertators who wish to audit a course will be removed from dissertator fee status and assessed regular graduate student fees and also will need to enroll in the appropriate number of graded credits (see enrollment requirements). Students who have research assistantship, fellowship or traineeship appointments are required to be enrolled full-time; audited courses do not count toward full-time enrollment.\nInstructors may limit the number of auditors in a course and may restrict participation of auditors in courses inappropriate for that function. For example, courses that by their nature require participation (seminars, research, laboratory, performance, or language courses) are typically considered inappropriate for auditing.  Additionally, independent study courses are not appropriate for auditing.\nTo audit a course, a student must first obtain the consent of the instructor. The student must follow the procedures established in the program offering the course. Graduate School Dean’s approval is required for all course changes, including audit; see the Course Changes section of this document for instructions. The Dean’s signature will be fulfilled once submitted to the Graduate School. The deadline to request/cancel permission to audit is the drop deadline, which is the end of the 9th week of class during the fall and spring semester. Requests for late audits will not be considered. Specific deadline dates, including those for summer sessions, are posted prior to each semester by the Office of the Registrar.\nThe enrollment system counts all credits in determining maximum credit loads. A Credit Overload Request from is required if a student’s total credit load exceeds the maximum limit per term.\nSee Authorization for Courses, Course Changes, Credit Changes, Dean’s Approval, Dissertator Status, Enrollment Requirements, Overloads, Refunds\n\n\n\n\nAuthorization for Courses\n\nMore\n\n\n\nEnrollment authorization may be required for certain courses and/or situations, such as:\n\nauditing courses\npermission to take a course when a student does not meet course controls or prerequisites, or\npermission to enroll in a closed course\n\nOnce authorized by the program offering the course, students then may enroll in the course.\nSee Add/Drop, Auditing Courses, Credit Changes, Pass/Fail\n\n\n\n\nBenefits\n\nMore\n\n\n\nProject/Program Assistants (PAs), Research Assistants (RAs), and Teaching Assistants (TAs), fellows, and trainees who hold at least a 33% appointment (or an equivalent) may be eligible for health insurance, vacation, sick leave, and remission of tuition. Students should contact their department/program staff benefits coordinator for details.\nGraduate students enrolled in service-based pricing programs, such as online and accelerated programs, are ineligible to receive tuition remission. See a list of UW–Madison academic programs with service-based pricing (NetID login required).\nSee Enrollment Requirements, Insurance and Medical Benefits, Tuition Remission, Payroll Benefits\n\n\n\n\nBreadth Requirements in Doctoral Education\n\nMore\n\n\n\nBreadth is a required component of doctoral training at UW–Madison. Given there are multiple paths to breadth, the Graduate School leaves the choice of whether students achieve breadth through a minor or other means up to the specific program.\nSee Minors\n\n\n\n\nCanceling Enrollment\n\nMore\n\n\n\nBefore the first day of classes (Canceling Enrollment)\nIf students do not wish to attend a semester and drop all courses before the first day of classes, they officially cancel their enrollment, owe no tuition or fees for that term, and have no semester entry on their transcript. In this case, it is not necessary for the student to submit a withdrawal request through MyUW.\nOn or after the first day of classes (Withdrawing)\nOn or after the first day of class, students who no longer wish to remain enrolled need to submit an electronic withdrawal request via MyUW Student Center. More information about canceling enrollment or withdrawal requests can be found on the Registrar’s website.\nSee Withdrawal\n\n\n\n\nCapstone Certificates\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe university offers capstone certificates for students not currently enrolled in a UW–Madison graduate degree program. Applicants must have completed a baccalaureate degree or equivalent credential from an accredited college or university. The capstone certificate is designed to ‘cap off’ undergraduate experience or to offer a focused professionally oriented experience. Capstone programs do not lead to the conferral of a graduate degree. Further information about capstone certificates can be found on the Professional Degrees & Certificates website.\nSee Graduate/Professional Certificates, Specialist Certificates\n\n\n\n\nCertificate of Doctoral Candidacy\n\nMore\n\n\n\nDissertators who do not plan on finishing their degree may request a Certificate of Doctoral Candidacy in recognition of their completion of all requirements toward the doctoral degree except for the dissertation (sometimes called all but dissertation/ABD at other institutions). The certificate shows the date of the preliminary examination as well as the issue date, but does not substitute for an official transcript from the Office of the Registrar. To obtain the certificate, students, advisors, or graduate coordinators should contact the Graduate School Degree Coordinator.\nSee Dissertator Status\n\n\n\n\nCertification of Enrollment Status\n\nMore\n\n\n\nFor purposes of certification to government or private agencies, the Office of the Registrar determines enrollment status as full-time or part-time according to institutional policies, which may differ from full-time or part-time requirements imposed by individual schools or programs. Certification of official enrollment for loan deferment, medical and auto insurance forms, and credit card applications can be obtained by going to the Office of the Registrar’s verifications webpage.\nVeterans Certification: Student Veterans who are eligible for Federal and State Educational Benefits should apply for certification of enrollment at University Veteran Services. Students receiving veterans’ benefits are required to promptly report any credit change or withdrawal from school to University Veteran Services.\nSee Enrollment Requirements\n\n\n\n\nCertification of Graduation (or ‘Degree Completion Letter’)\n\nMore\n\n\n\nIf you have completed all degree requirements and deposited your thesis or dissertation and are waiting until the next degree conferral date to receive your degree, you may request from the Office of the Registrar a Degree Completion Letter (Degree Verification) indicating that all requirements have been completed. Important: All grades from the semester in which you are depositing your dissertation (and all other outstanding grades) must be reported before you can receive a completion letter.\nSince master’s and doctoral degrees do not appear on transcripts until 4 to 6 weeks after the end of a semester, students may wish to obtain this letter from the Registrar’s Office to provide to employers or other universities to verify degree completion before the transcript posting, but after all grades are finalized and their dissertation (doctoral degree) or thesis (if required for the master’s degree) is approved and deposited.\nSee Degree Conferral/Payroll End Dates, Holds\n\n\n\n\nChange of Degree Level (Plan) or Degree Named Option (Sub-Major)\n\nMore\n\n\n\nDegree Level (Plan)\nA student may change their degree level, for example, if students with a master’s degree plan have completed their master’s degree and want to continue in the same program for the doctoral degree. To change degree level, see Applying to Add/Change Program, Plan, or Named Option.\nNamed Option (Sub-Major)\nA named option is a formally documented sub-major within an academic major program. Named options appear on the transcript with degree conferral. The Graduate Faculty Executive Committee approves official named options. Many programs may also have unofficial specializations, concentrations, or tracks; unlike named options these do not appear on the transcript. Find more information on named options. To report a change in degree named option, see Applying to Add/Change Program, Plan, or Named Option.\nFor questions, please contact the Graduate School Degree Coordinator.\nSee Applying to Add/Change Program, Plan, or Named Option, Programs (or ‘Majors’)\n\n\n\n\nCommittees (Doctoral/Master’s/MFA)\n\nMore\n\n\n\nCommittees advise and evaluate satisfactory progress, administer preliminary and final oral examinations, evaluate a thesis or dissertation, and/or sign a degree warrant. A student’s program arranges a committee with appropriate expertise to afford the breadth and depth needed in degree examinations. The responsibilities of individual committee members are determined by the program. The executive committee (or its equivalent) of a program/department is responsible for approving the composition of all graduate committees. The final warrant request which includes committee membership must be submitted to the Graduate School at least three weeks before the examination date. Students should consult their advisor and their program’s student handbook for the specific function of degree committees in their program.\nUse this online tool to help you determine whether the proposed committee would meet the following criteria.\nTHE GRADUATE SCHOOL REQUIREMENTS FOR GRADUATE COMMITTEES ARE AS FOLLOWS:\nFor doctoral committees/final oral examination committees:\n1. The chair or one of the co-chairs of the committee must be graduate faculty1 from the student’s program.  (Note:  Faculty who retire or resign retain graduate faculty status for one year and can serve as chair or a co-chair during that time.)4,5\n2. The committee must have at least four members. The committee must have members from at least two University of Wisconsin—Madison graduate programs.3,5    \n3. Three of the committee members must be UW–Madison graduate faculty or former UW–Madison graduate faculty up to one year after resignation or retirement.\n4. At least three committee members must be designated as readers.6\n5. The fourth member and any additional members may be from any of the following categories, as approved by the program executive committee (or its equivalent): graduate faculty, faculty from a department without a graduate program1, academic staff2 (including emeritus faculty), visiting faculty, faculty from other institutions, scientists, research associates, and other individuals deemed qualified by the executive committee (or its equivalent).\n6. All committee members have voting rights. To receive a doctoral degree, students cannot receive more than one dissenting vote from their committee on the final degree warrant.\nFor MFA final committees:\n1. The chair or one of the co-chairs of the committee must be graduate faculty1 from the student’s program.  (Note:  Faculty who retire or resign retain graduate faculty status for one year and can serve as chair or a co-chair during that time.)4,5\n2. The committee must have at least four members.\n3. Three of the committee members must be UW–Madison graduate faculty or former UW–Madison graduate faculty up to one year after resignation or retirement.\n4. The fourth member and any additional members may be from any of the following categories, as approved by the program executive committee (or its equivalent): graduate faculty, faculty from a department without a graduate program1, academic staff2 (including emeritus faculty), visiting faculty, faculty from other institutions, scientists, research associates, and other individuals deemed qualified by the executive committee (or its equivalent).\n5. All committee members have voting rights. To receive a MFA degree, students cannot receive more than one dissenting vote from their committee on the final degree warrant.\nFor master’s thesis committees:\n1. The chair or one of the co-chairs of the committee must be graduate faculty1 from the student’s program.  (Note:  Faculty who retire or resign retain graduate faculty status for one year and can serve as chair or a co-chair during that time.)3,5\n2. The committee must have at least three members.\n3. Two of the committee members must be UW–Madison graduate faculty or former UW–Madison graduate faculty up to one year after resignation or retirement.\n4. The third member and any additional members may be from any of the following categories, as approved by the program executive committee (or its equivalent): graduate faculty, faculty from a department without a graduate program1, academic staff2 (including emeritus faculty), visiting faculty, faculty from other institutions, scientists, research associates, and other individuals deemed qualified by the executive committee (or its equivalent).\n5. All committee members have voting rights. To receive a master’s degree, students cannot receive more than one dissenting vote from their committee on the final degree warrant.\nFor master’s non-thesis committees:\n1. The committees must have at least one graduate faculty1 from the student’s program.3,5\n2. To receive a master’s degree, students cannot receive more than one dissenting vote from their committee on the final degree warrant.\nFootnotes:\n1 Graduate Faculty: The UW–Madison Faculty Policies and Procedures 3.05 contains the policies and exceptions regarding the graduate faculty status.\n2 Academic Staff: The UW–Madison Faculty Policies and Procedures 3.05H contains the policy related to academic staff serving on the committees.\n3 Program: Programs are officially approved courses of study and research leading to a master’s or doctoral degree. They may be administered from within a disciplinary department or across departments by an interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary cluster of faculty. Some programs have official areas of concentration within them (called named options or subplans) at the master’s and/or doctoral levels. Both programs and named options appear on the student’s transcript. Some programs have unofficial tracks, specializations, or concentrations, but these are not listed on the transcript. Contact the program’s graduate coordinator for more information.\n4 The advisor does not have to be chair of the committee, although it is often the case. Moreover, the co-advisors/co-chairs will be designated in the dissertation document.\n5 Note that affiliate appointments may be used to satisfy this requirement.\n6 Readers: Committee members who commit themselves to closely reading and reviewing the entire dissertation. The rationale for specifically designating non-reader status is to facilitate faculty participation in dissertations without automatically expecting the level of commitment associated with deeply engaging a PhD thesis. Given faculty workloads, designating a non-reader in some cases may permit faculty participation where engagement would otherwise be impossible. As long as the Graduate School minimum of at least three committee members that are readers is upheld, programs will remain in compliance with Graduate School policy. Programs may choose to have stricter requirements.\nSee Advisor\n\n\n\n\nCompassionate Tuition Adjustment\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe Graduate School supports the principles of a compassionate tuition adjustment to accommodate students who withdraw in the following circumstance:\n\nThe students have experienced an unexpected life circumstance and/or traumatic event for which they have little or no control, and\nIt appears that the event will impede/prevent the students from successfully completing the semester.\n\nThe dean or the dean’s designee will assess the meaning and effect of the event on the student and the request for tuition adjustment. Students requesting a tuition adjustment should submit their request in writing to Academic Services in the Graduate School, along with written support for the request from the student’s faculty advisor and/or graduate program chair. Relevant documentation may be required.\nSee Dean’s Approval\n\n\n\n\nConcurrent Appointments for Fellows/Trainees\n\nMore\n\n\n\nConcurrent appointments describes a situation where a graduate student holds multiple appointments as a fellow, trainee, and/or graduate assistant. Federal agencies and non-federal donors often place restrictions on the amount of work in which an awardee may engage, or on additional stipends an awardee may receive. In addition, the university has a concurrent appointment policy that places limits on multiple appointments for fellows or trainees.\nWhenever assistantships (RA, TA, or PA) are combined with fellowships or traineeships, total compensation cannot exceed the department’s full-time RA rate that was reported to the Graduate School for the current year (fellowship/traineeship + assistantship = total compensation). The list of approved program rates can be found on the Graduate Assistantships webpage, under “Assistantship stipends by program”.\nThe concurrent appointment policy for fellows/trainees can be found here in the University of Wisconsin-Madison Policy for Supplementation and Concurrent Appointments for Graduate Students Holding Predoctoral Fellowships or Traineeships.\nSee Maximum Levels of Appointments\n\n\n\n\nContinuous Enrollment Requirement for Dissertators\n\nMore\n\n\n\nOnce students achieve dissertator status they must maintain continuous enrollment until completion of the doctoral degree. In order to maintain continuous enrollment, dissertators must enroll each fall and spring semester for 3 credits (300 or above) directly related to their dissertation research (generally research and thesis and/or required seminars). In some cases, the 3 credits can be a combination of research and a seminar. Fall and spring enrollment are required whether or not they reside in Madison.\nAudits and pass/fail do not satisfy this requirement. Additional courses taken audit or pass/fail will result in removal of dissertator fee status.\nStudents are exempt from the requirement to enroll for the summer term, unless they are defending and/or depositing their dissertation or have a Research Assistantship (RA), fellowship, or traineeship that requires summer enrollment, or are using university facilities (including faculty and staff time).\nIf dissertators do not maintain continuous enrollment, they will be assessed a degree completion fee equal to 12 times the current per-credit rate in effect at the time that they submit their dissertation to the Graduate School for final review.\nSee Degree Completion Fee, Dissertator Status, Enrollment Requirements, Readmission to Graduate School (for previously enrolled graduate students)\n\n\n\n\nCourse Changes\n\nMore\n\n\n\nPrior to making changes to courses, be sure to review the Office of the Registrar’s Enrollment Deadlines Page for important dates and deadlines, and the Graduate School’s Enrollment Requirements including important information about minimum credits required.\nPrior to deadlines, students may make course changes online via MyUW Student Center. See the Late Enrollment/Late Course Change/Late Drop document for changing enrollment after the deadlines.\nIf a course change is made after the fee refund deadlines (including audited, modular, and zero-credit courses) students may owe additional money, even if the total number of credits for which they are enrolled does not change. The Bursar’s Office will notify students if they owe additional fees or are entitled to a refund.\nStudents holding graduate assistantships, fellowships, and traineeships must meet minimum enrollment requirements when making course changes.\nInternational students considering a course change that may drop them to part-time status must first receive authorization from International Student Services (ISS). This will ensure that they remain in compliance with Department of Homeland Security (DHS) visa regulations. International students holding graduate assistantships, fellowships, and traineeships must meet minimum enrollment requirements as well.\nFor more information and questions, contact the Office of the Registrar or Graduate School Academic Services. The Registrar’s Office also offers demos and tutorials for course enrollment. For instructions on how to late add/change/drop a class, visit the Late Enrollment/Late Course Change/Late Drop document.\nSee Add/Drop, Auditing Courses, Authorization for Courses, Credit Changes, Enrollment Requirements, Late Enrollment/Late Course Change/Late Drop, Section Changes, Tuition and Fee Information\n\n\n\n\nCourse Numbering System\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe number assigned to a course gives an indication of for whom the course is intended. While graduate students can enroll in courses numbered under 300, those courses do not count for any credits toward a graduate degree or for minimum enrollment requirements.\nThe Minimum Graduate Coursework Policy requires at least 50% of a graduate degree coursework be taken with courses that have the graduate level course attribute. See the Course Attributes Policy for specific information on courses that meet this requirement.\nSee also Continuous Enrollment Requirement, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Prior Coursework\n\n\n\n\nCredit Changes\n\nMore\n\n\n\nStudents are not allowed to enroll for more or fewer credits than indicated for a course in the Schedule of Classes.\nFor more information and questions, contact the Office of the Registrar or Graduate School Office of Academic Services. Demos & Tutorials for course changes are available here. For instructions on how to late add/change/drop a class, visit the Late Enrollment/Late Course Change/Late Drop section.\nSee Auditing Courses, Course Changes, Dean’s Approval, Late Enrollment/Late Course Change/Late Drop, Pass/Fail, Variable Credit Courses, Tuition and Fee Information\n\n\n\n\nCredit/No Credit Grades\n\nMore\n\n\n\nCourses that have been designated in the Schedule of Classes as credit/no credit are entered on transcripts as either CR, if students earned credits for which the course was offered, or N, if students did not earn any credit, even though they were enrolled for the course. Any course numbered 300 or above that is taken for credit/no credit will count toward the Graduate School’s minimum graduate degree credit requirement and the minimum graduate residence credit requirement (including 300-level courses in English as a Second Language). Visit the Office of the Registrar’s Valid Grades webpage for more information.\n\n\n\n\nDeadlines\n\nMore\n\n\n\nStudents are responsible for learning about and complying with campus deadlines. Failure to meet deadlines for enrollment, payment of fees, changing courses or credits, and receiving a degree can cost time, money, or both. The Office of the Registrar’s Enrollment Deadlines page lists enrollment, fee payment, and course change deadlines. Visit the Graduate School’s Degree Deadlines page for more information about the deadlines for achieving dissertator status or receiving a degree in any given semester.\nGraduate students should note that Graduate School deadlines do not necessarily correspond to undergraduate enrollment deadlines. Refer to the Office of the Registrar’s Enrollment Deadlines for detailed and specific enrollment and refund deadlines and dates.\nSee Add/Drop, Course Changes, Pass/Fail, Withdrawal\n\n\n\n\nDean’s Approval\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe Graduate School acts as the academic dean’s office for all graduate students. If a student needs a dean’s approval or authorization, they should contact the Graduate School Office of Academic Services at gsacserv@grad.wisc.edu.\n\n\n\n\nDegree Completion Fee\n\nMore\n\n\n\nFor master’s students\nIn lieu of enrollment, the Graduate School may approve payment of a degree completion fee for a master’s degree candidate who has completed all of the degree requirements except thesis defense, comprehensive examination(s), presentation of a final project, or removal of an incomplete grade. To be eligible students must have submitted their final thesis or project paper to their advisor while they were enrolled. This fee is comparable to 2 graduate credits at the current resident tuition rate. This fee is established annually and assessed per semester. Students should ask their program to submit a Degree Completion Fee Request Form to the Graduate School on their behalf before the beginning of the semester when students are completing a master’s degree. After the Graduate School approves the request, the fee will be added to the student’s account. Students must pay the completion fee before the program requests a warrant.\nFor dissertators\nThe Graduate School requires all dissertators to maintain continuous enrollment (see the continuous enrollment policy for dissertators). Dissertators must enroll in the semester(s) in which they defend, submit their dissertations, and graduate (see enrollment requirements for dissertators). In rare circumstances where this is not possible, a degree completion fee is assessed to recognize the inevitable use of university facilities (including faculty and staff time) up to and including the successful defense and submission of the dissertation. The fee is equal to 12 times the current per-credit dissertator rate in effect at the time the dissertation is submitted. The fee is assessed at the time dissertators are ready to complete the degree and is based on the resident or nonresident tuition status dissertators had at their last term of enrollment. If dissertators break enrollment and then reenter and enroll for less than 4 continuous terms before completion, they will pay a prorated rate (the 12-credit fee minus all continuous enrollment credits paid since the time of readmission). If enrollment is broken, but a dissertator reenters and enrolls for at least 4 continuous terms, then a completion fee is not assessed. Students must pay the completion fee before the program requests a warrant\nSee Continuous Enrollment Requirement for Dissertators, Enrollment Requirements\n\n\n\n\nDegree Conferral/Payroll End Dates\n\nMore\n\n\n\nGraduate students who complete all degree requirements at any point during a term remain officially enrolled and retain student status through the official degree conferral date for that term, as determined by the Secretary of the Faculty and posted as conferral date on the transcript. Degrees are granted three times per year in May, August, and December. The official conferral date can be found on the Office of the Registrar’s Dates & Deadlines webpage.\nFunding for graduating students\nGraduate assistants, fellows, and trainees may remain on the payroll until the end of the term, as stated above, or may be removed if necessary for a change of status (e.g. to a postdoc or academic staff position) or end of grant funding. If a student is removed, the Bursar’s Office will check with the Graduate School to confirm graduation at the end of the given term and will maintain tuition remission for appropriately funded students if the student remains on payroll through the dates listed below:\n\nDoctoral candidates: through the date of dissertation deposit or through the official conferral date of term\nNon-thesis master’s candidates: through the completion date stated on warrant or through the official conferral date of term\nThesis master’s candidates: through the date thesis is received by the Memorial Library or through the official conferral date of term\n\nInternational students: contact International Student Services for guidance on the degree completion date and its impact on the visa status. The dates listed above may be different for international students.\nWindow Period degrees\nThe “Window Period” is the time between the end of one degree period and the beginning of the next. Students are eligible to complete their degree requirements during the window period if they were registered for the previous semester (fall, spring, or summer). If all degree requirements are met by the end of the window period, a student’s degree will be granted for the following semester. Students will not have to register or pay fees for the next semester.\nStudents receiving window period degrees may remain on payroll and retain student status only through the dates listed below:\n\nDoctoral candidates: through the date of dissertation deposit or through the last day of the window period\nNon-thesis master’s candidates: through the completion date stated on warrant\nThesis master’s candidates: through the date thesis is received by the Memorial Library\n\nInternational students: contact International Student Services for guidance on the degree completion date and its impact on the visa status. The dates listed above may be different for international students.\nSee Certification of Graduation (or ‘Degree Completion Letter’), Graduation\n\n\n\n\nDegree Summary\n\nMore\n\n\n\nA computerized graduate degree summary is not prepared for graduate students (e.g. the Degree Audit Reporting System, or DARS). Students’ programs, particularly their advisors, are responsible for ensuring timely fulfillment of Graduate School and program requirements. Students should consult their program’s satisfactory progress criteria in their program’s student handbook, or in the Graduate Guide.\nStudents and programs can check academic progress using the Graduate Student Tracking System.\nSee Advisor, Satisfactory Progress\n\n\n\n\nDisability Accommodations\n\nMore\n\n\n\nStudents with disabilities are encouraged to inform their faculty advisor and instructor of their need for disability-related accommodations in a timely manner. Implementation of reasonable accommodations is a shared faculty and student responsibility. Faculty, either directly or in coordination with the McBurney Disability Resource Center, are expected to work with students to identify and provide reasonable accommodations.\nThe McBurney Disability Resource Center provides disability-related services and accommodations to undergraduate, graduate, professional, special and guest students. The Center works closely with students and faculty on the provision of reasonable accommodations to ensure access to the learning environment. The Center makes referrals to other campus offices or community resources for non-classroom accommodations such as housing, transportation, personal care attendants, etc. Students should contact the Center upon admission to begin the eligibility for services process. Early notice is essential in order to have services and accommodations in place prior to the start of the semester.\nMcBurney Disability Resource Center\n702 West Johnson Street, Suite 2104\n608/263-2741 (voice)\n608/225-7956 (text)\nmcburney@studentlife.wisc.edu\nSee Discrimination\n\n\n\n\nDiscrimination\n\nMore\n\n\n\nIn conformance with applicable federal and state law and with university policy, UW–Madison does not discriminate on the basis of age, ancestry, color, creed, disability, ethnicity, marital or parental status, national origin, pregnancy, race, religion, disability, retaliation for making a complaint of discrimination or taking part in an investigation relating to discrimination, sex, sexual orientation, or veteran’s status with regard to treatment of students in the educational programs or activities that the university operates.\nShould students wish to speak to someone about discrimination or harassment protected by federal or state laws or campus policies, they should contact the Office of Compliance or the Office of Student Assistance and Support.\n\n\n\n\nDissertation Standards and Publishing\n\nMore\n\n\n\nA doctoral dissertation must be a dissertator’s own work. If it is the result of research enterprises in which others have collaborated, a substantial portion must represent the dissertator’s own contribution and the other research participants must be identified.\nEffective September 1, 2017, dissertations must acknowledge contributions received from other individuals, including co-authors of published work that appears in the document, such as in designing the research, executing the research, analyzing the data, interpreting the data/research, or writing, proofing, or copyediting the manuscript.\nPublication of the doctoral dissertation is required. The university uses ProQuest UMI ETD Administrator to publish the dissertation electronically and on microfilm and to publish an abstract of the dissertation in Dissertation Abstracts, a monthly publication. Dissertators must pay the cost of processing the dissertation and publishing the abstract by ProQuest.\nAll doctoral dissertations are reviewed by the Graduate School’s Office of Academic Services. More information can be found on the Graduate School’s Completing Your Degree webpage.\nMost master’s theses at UW–Madison are not published through ProQuest, although a student may choose to do so. If students want to publish their master’s thesis through ProQuest, they should contact the Graduate School’s Office of Academic Services.\nSee Copyright, Deadlines\n\n\n\n\nDissertator Status\n\nMore\n\n\n\nDissertator is a unique fee status for students who have completed all requirements for a doctoral degree except for the dissertation. To be eligible for dissertator fee status, a student must:\n\nPass the preliminary examination(s);\nSatisfy the doctoral minimum graduate residence credit requirement;\nComplete all minor requirements, if the major program requires a minor;\nComplete all program requirements except the dissertation;\nClear all Incomplete grades or Progress grades in non-research courses (progress grades in 990 research may remain);\nEarn at least a 3.0 cumulative graduate GPA;\nReturn the signed and dated preliminary exam warrant to the Graduate School.\n\nDissertator status is effective at the start of the semester following completion of all dissertator requirements for the doctoral degree except for the dissertation. In order to initiate the change to dissertator status, the prelim warrant must be sent to the Graduate School in a timely fashion. Students can check on dissertator status by contacting their graduate program coordinator. All dissertator requirements must be met before the first day of classes to be a dissertator for any given semester. If all dissertator requirements are completed before the first day of classes but the signed prelim warrant does not reach the Graduate School by that deadline, the student can still become a dissertator that semester. Submit the warrant to the Graduate School as soon as possible and enroll for at least 3 credits (usually 990 research) for that semester. Removal of Dissertator Status: A dissertator who enrolls for more (or fewer) than 3 credits will be removed from dissertator status for the fall or spring term in which the enrollment is not exactly 3 credits. During the summer, however, an enrolled dissertator may ask their advisor to request an overload of 1-2 additional credits in a short session and still retain dissertator fee status, if the course is related to dissertation research or professional training that is not offered in regular semesters. The removal of dissertator status may have the following consequences:\n\nGraduate assistant (TA/PA/RA) stipend rates may have to be adjusted to the non-dissertator rate, or percent limitations\nFees are assessed at the non-dissertator rate\nFull-time status may change to part-time, possibly affecting loan deferral, visa status, etc.\n\nIf a dissertator wants to pursue a graduate degree or certificate in another area, the dissertator fee status will be discontinued and regular graduate fees will be assessed, with possible consequences listed above. Find more information about the tuition and fees for a dissertator and non-dissertator on the Bursar’s Office Tuition and Fees webpage.\nSee Addition/Change of Program, Plan, or Named Option, Enrollment Requirements, Maximum Levels of Appointments, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement\n\n\n\n\nDoctoral Minors\n\nMore\n\n\n\nBreadth is a required component of doctoral training at UW–Madison. Given there are multiple paths to breadth, the Graduate School leaves the choice of whether students achieve breadth through a doctoral minor (two options as described below), Graduate/Professional certificate, or other means up to the specific graduate program.  The specific Breadth Requirement Policy, including information on certificates, is found here: https://policy.wisc.edu/library/UW-1200\nMinor options are as follows:\nOption A (external doctoral minor): Requires a minimum of 9 credits in a doctoral minor program (single disciplinary or multi-disciplinary). Fulfillment of this option requires the approval of the doctoral minor program.\nOption B (distributed doctoral minor): Requires a minimum of 9 credits in one or more programs forming a coherent topic.  Fulfillment of this option requires the approval of the doctoral major program.\nThe Graduate School’s minimum course requirements for the doctoral minor include:\n\nAn average GPA of 3.00 on all minor coursework;\nCoursework must be graded courses numbered 300 or above; no audits or pass/fail;\nMaximum 3 credits of independent study (e.g., 699, 799, 899, 999);\nResearch and thesis cannot be used to satisfy the minor (e.g., 790, 890, 990);\nNo more than 5 credits of coursework completed more than 5 years prior to admission to the doctoral program; coursework taken 10 years ago or more may not be used.\n\nA student cannot earn a doctoral minor and a Graduate/Professional certificate of the same name. Credits earned towards the doctoral minor may count towards the minimum graduate residence requirement, minimum graduate degree requirement, and the minimum graduate coursework (50%) requirement.\nSee Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Prior Coursework\n\n\n\n\nDouble Degrees\n\nMore\n\n\n\nDouble degrees are two same-level (master’s or doctoral) degrees from two separate graduate programs. Students completing a double degree earn two degrees (two programs), and receive two diplomas. Double degree candidates have two advisors and two separate committees, and they complete two theses (master’s) or dissertations (doctoral).\nStudents may apply for an additional program at the time of original application, add a program at any time during their enrollment, or reapply and pursue a second degree after completion of the first.  Students should inquire with each program prior to enrollment to see if additional policies exist that would restrict the ability to complete a double degree.\nIn all scenarios, regardless of whether double degree programs are completed consecutively or concurrently, students must:\n\nBe admitted to both programs;\nFulfill the Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence, degree, and coursework credit requirements for each degree;\nComplete the specific degree requirements for each program, including minimum graduate degree, residence, and coursework (50%) credit requirements for each;\nHave no more than a 25% credit overlap between degrees, based on the lower credit requirements of the two programs;\nHave an advisor from each program and both advisors must be informed of each other.\n\nApproval of the double degree: at the time of graduation, each program must submit to the Graduate School a list of the courses being used to satisfy that program’s requirements. Both advisors must sign the course lists as indication of approval. The Graduate School will review the course lists for credit overlap between degrees.\nDoctoral students who add a master’s degree program outside the doctoral program cannot be dissertators.\nInternational students must contact International Student Services before adding a second degree program.\nSee Addition/Change of Program, Plan, or Named Option, Change of Degree Level (Plan), International Students Maintaining Legal Status, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Appendix 5 – Double, Joint, and Dual Degrees at a Glance\n\n\n\n\nDouble, Joint, and Dual Degrees Comparison\n\nMore\n\n\n\nDouble Degree\n\n2 degrees, 2 diplomas\n2 graduate majors\n2 advisors, 2 committees\n2 theses or dissertations\nMinimum Graduate School requirements for each degree\n2 prelims (PhD)\n2 warrant requests, 2 warrants\nList of courses used for each major must be submitted to GS when requesting warrants.\nNo more than 25% overlap (of the total credits for the program with lowest credit requirement).\n\nJoint Degree\n\n1 degree, 1 diploma\n2 graduate majors\n2 advisors, 1 committee\n1 thesis or dissertation\nJoint prelim, if both major programs agree, or 2 prelims (PhD)\n1 warrant request, 1 warrant\nMust submit proposal to GS before beginning of second year.  Need signatures of both advisors and both program directors, and Graduate School approval.\n\nDual Degree\n\nOne graduate degree and one professional degree (i.e. a degree from the School of Medicine and Public Health or the Law school).\n\n\n\n\n\nDual Degrees: Graduate and Professional Combination\n\nMore\n\n\n\nA dual degree is two degrees, one of which is granted in a graduate program, and the other in a professional school (e.g., MD, JD, DVM, DPharm, MPH). Students must inquire with each program prior to enrollment to see if additional policies exist that would restrict the ability to complete a dual degree.\nTo receive a dual degree students must:\n\nBe admitted to both programs;\nComplete the specific degree requirements for the Graduate School and the professional school;\nFulfill the Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence, degree, and coursework (50%) credit requirements for the graduate degree.\n\nTuition is determined by a combined fee schedule table. Assessed fees are roughly halfway between graduate fees and professional fees. Credit limits each semester coincide with the professional schools’ higher credit maximums. Find more information about the tuition and fees on the Bursar’s Office Tuition and Fees webpage.\nSee Addition/Change of Program, Plan, or Named Option, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Appendix 5 – Double, Joint, and Dual Degrees at a Glance\n\n\n\n\nEffective Date of Program Requirements upon Enrollment\n\nMore\n\n\n\nAny student entering or readmitted to a graduate program must adhere to the requirements in the most current Academic Policies & Procedures and Graduate Guide. This includes all new incoming students, those students continuing from a master’s degree to a doctoral degree, add/change program students, degree completion fee students, and any readmitted students. A student who chooses to discontinue their degree program for a semester or more would return under the requirements in the most recent Academic Policies & Procedures.\nStudents enrolled prior to fall 2014 in a MFA, specialist certificate, or doctoral degree program have the option to complete their degree under the prior policy requirements if they maintain continuous enrollment.\nA student who advances from the master’s level to the doctoral level fall 2014 or after is subject to the requirements in the most current Academic Policies & Procedures.\nAppeals will be considered in exceptional cases. The request for appeal must be made on a student-by-student basis. The appeal should come from the students faculty advisor and/or program chair and be sent to the Graduate School Director of Academic Services. The appeal should include sufficient justification for the request and any supporting documentation.\nSee Continuous Enrollment Requirement\n\n\n\n\nEnrollment\n\nMore\n\n\n\nCourse enrollment is available through MyUW in the Course Search and Enroll App or the Student Center. Once enrolled, students should confirm that they are enrolled in the appropriate number of graduate-level graded courses. Students should enroll early to avoid a late initial enrollment fee and class cancellation due to low enrollment. Visit the Office of the Registrar’s website for more information about enrollment deadlines.\nSee Enrollment Requirements\n\n\n\n\nEnrollment Accountability\n\nMore\n\n\n\nStudents are responsible for the accuracy of their enrollment/class schedule and for all tuition, fees, and academic consequences that result from that schedule. Continuing students in good standing may enroll for the next term without special permission from the Graduate School. Before enrolling, students should consult their advisor to approve their class schedule for that term and to determine if they need authorization for any proposed courses. Note that graduate students may not enroll in Honors credits, as those are for undergraduate students only.\nAll students must use the online enrollment system. Instructions on how to enroll using MyUW along with additional enrollment information is available through the Office of the Registrar’s website. The Office of the Registrar also provides enrollment demos and tutorials. All students will receive an email message from the Office of the Registrar about their assigned enrollment appointment time. Students can expect to receive this notification about one week prior to the beginning of the priority enrollment period. There are extra fees for late initial enrollment and late fee payment. These deadlines are available at the Office of the Registrar’s Enrollment Deadlines webpage.\nSee Enrollment, Enrollment Requirements, Holds, Late Enrollment/Late Course Change/Late Drop, Overloads, Readmission to Graduate School (for previously enrolled graduate students), Schedule of Classes\n\n\n\n\nEnrollment Confirmation\n\nMore\n\n\n\nStudents can confirm their current enrollment status through MyUW.\nFailure to receive a student account invoice does not relieve students of the obligation to meet established fee payment deadlines as displayed in the MyUW Student Center, Class Search. If a student does not receive an invoice by late August (mid-January for spring semester), they can get a copy at the Bursar’s Office.\n\n\n\n\nEnrollment Requirements\n\nMore\n\n\n\nALL of the following credit requirements (except F-1 and J-1 visa requirements) must be satisfied by graded courses taken at 300 or above; courses numbered below 300, audit, and pass/fail do not satisfy enrollment requirements.\nFull-time enrollment: The Graduate School considers full-time enrollment to be 8-15 graded credits* taken at 300 or above, excluding pass/fail and audit, during the fall and spring semesters, and 4-12 credits* during the summer term. Dissertators are considered full-time at 3 credits. If students elect not to enroll as full-time students as defined by the Graduate School, they are responsible for knowing about possible obligations that may require full-time status. Such obligations may include visa eligibility, fellowships, assistantships, financial aid, external funding agencies, and program satisfactory progress requirements.\nMaximum enrollment: Non-dissertator maximum credit load is 15 graded credits* taken at 300 or above during the fall and spring semester and 12 credits during the summer term. Any exceptions to the maximum credit load permitted must be obtained via the Credit Overload Request form.\nMinimum enrollment: Non-dissertator minimum credit load is 2 credits* during the fall and spring semesters. Graduate students must be enrolled in their program for at least the minimum requirement in the semester in which they receive a degree; master’s degree students expecting a summer degree must be enrolled in their program for a minimum of 2 graduate credits in any summer session*. Graduate students who do not need to maintain full-time status (including TAs and PAs) have a 2 credit enrollment minimum during fall and spring semesters. Minimum requirements must be fulfilled by courses taken for a grade (not pass/fail or audit) and must be taken at 300 or above.\nUnderload: During the fall and spring semesters, non-dissertators must enroll for a minimum of 2 credits.* Audit and pass/fail courses do not satisfy this enrollment requirement. Dissertators are required to enroll for 3 graded credits taken at 300 or above and directly related to their dissertation research.\nThe specific situations listed below have special enrollment requirements.\nDissertators: Dissertators must enroll in exactly 3 credits* directly related to their dissertation (generally research and thesis or required seminars) during fall and spring semesters. Dissertators are considered full-time at 3 credits*. Dissertators who are summer RAs, trainees or fellows, or who expect to graduate in summer, must enroll in the general 8-week summer session (DHH) for 3 credits*. Additional courses for credit, audit, or pass/fail will result in removal of dissertator status and tuition assessment at the regular graduate rate.\nOnce dissertator status has been achieved, courses other than 990 must be directly related to the dissertation research and approved by the advisor. Dissertators must enroll during the semester or general 8-week summer session (DHH) in which they expect to earn a degree. Students must be enrolled during the semester when they defend the dissertation and when they deposit the dissertation. If defending and depositing in two different semesters, the student is required to be enrolled in both semesters. Students do not have to be dissertators during the semester or summer in which they expect to earn a doctoral degree, but they must be eligible for dissertator status before they complete the doctoral degree, and they must enroll in the semester in which they will graduate.\nIf a student enrolls before the dissertator status is approved, the enrollment system may indicate they are not eligible for that course. The enrollment system does not care if students are dissertators. If students had problems getting into a course, it is probably because permission has not been entered into the enrollment system. Most individualized study courses, such as research and thesis, require instructor’s permission and online authorization before enrollment is possible.\nIf dissertator status is not processed by the segregated fee deadline, students should register for 3 credits and pay regular non-dissertator graduate fees. The fee difference will be adjusted for that semester when dissertator status is indicated in the system.\nMaster’s with thesis required: A master’s degree candidate required to submit a thesis to Memorial Library, as indicated on the degree warrant, must be enrolled in the semester in which they defend their thesis. If a student defends in a window period, they need to have been enrolled in the previous term. A student does not need to be enrolled to deposit their thesis to Memorial Library.\nAssistantship appointees: It is against university policy to hold an assistantship without being appropriately enrolled.  Assistantships include those at UW-Madison as well as any UW System institution, including UW–Extension.\nRA (Research Assistant): RAs are required to carry a full load each semester (8 to 15 credits* including research or thesis credits for non-dissertators, 3 credits* for dissertators) and at least 2 credits* during the general 8-week summer session (DHH) (3 credits* for dissertators). Dissertators who hold assistantships are considered full-time with 3 credits* directly related to their dissertation.\nTA (Teaching Assistant) and PA (Project Assistant):\nMinimum enrollment for PAs and TAs is 2 credits* (3 credits* for dissertators) during the fall and spring semesters.\n\nTo be considered full-time by the Registrar for loan deferment and for certification of student immigration status, non-dissertator PAs and TAs who hold an appointment of at least 33.33% must be enrolled for 6 credits*, or those who hold an appointment of at least 50% must be enrolled for 4 credits*.\nDissertator PAs and TAs are considered full-time with 3 credits* directly related to their dissertation (generally research and thesis or required seminars).\nMaximum enrollment for PAs and TAs is 15 credits* during the fall and spring.\nThe Graduate School has no enrollment requirement for the summer session for PAs and TAs, unless the student is receiving a summer degree, but individual programs may.\n\nFellows: Non-dissertator graduate students holding fellowships that are payrolled through the university must be enrolled full-time: 8 credits* during the fall and spring semester. Fellows who are non-dissertators with 12-month appointments must also enroll in 2 credits* during the general 8-week summer session (DHH). Those who are not payrolled as fellows over the summer are not required to be enrolled. Those who are payrolled as fellows during any part of the summer term must enroll in the general 8-week summer session (DHH). Fellows who are dissertators must enroll in 3 credits* during the fall and spring semesters. Fellows with 12-month appointments who are dissertators must also enroll in 3 credits* during the general 8-week summer session (DHH).\nTrainees: Trainees must carry a full load each fall and spring semester of 8 to 15 credits* including research or thesis credits for non-dissertators (3 credits* for dissertators), and at least 2 credits* during the general 8-week summer session (DHH) (3 credits* for dissertators).\nInternational students: Both F-1 and J-1 student visa regulations require students to be enrolled full-time each fall and spring semester (8 credits, not taken as audit). Summer enrollment is not required by the U.S. federal government regulations for F-1/J-1 visa holders. However, summer enrollment may be required due to other circumstances; see summer enrollment requirements for assistantships, fellowships, traineeships, and graduating students. Failure to maintain full-time status can result in loss of F-1/J-1 student benefits, including on-campus employment and practical/academic training options. Any exceptions to full-time enrollment must be authorized by International Student Services (ISS). Visit the ISS webpage to learn more about visa requirements. Permission from ISS to drop below full-time enrollment does NOT exempt an international student from meeting the enrollment requirement determined by a Teaching Assistantship (TA), Project Assistantship (PA), Research Assistantship (RA), fellowship, traineeship, or dissertator status.\nInternational students-online learning credit limit: F-1 and J-1 student visa holders have restrictions regarding the number of online credits that can be taken during the semester as it relates to fulfilling the full-time enrollment requirement.  There are also restrictions regarding online enrollment during the final term of study-especially when the final term for completion is in summer. For more information, visit the ISS Online Course Enrollment webpage.\nSummer enrollment requirements: Students must be enrolled at UW–Madison if they are using university facilities, including faculty and staff time.\n\nDissertators defending and/or depositing dissertation (completing their degree) in summer must enroll for 3 credits* in the general 8-week summer session (DHH).\nDissertator RAs must enroll for 3 credits* in the general 8-week summer session (DHH).\nDissertator fellows with 12-month appointments are required to enroll for 3 credits* in the general 8-week summer session (DHH).\nDissertator trainees with 12-month appointments are required to enroll for 3 credits* in the general 8-week summer session (DHH).\nMaster’s candidates, who expect to graduate in summer must enroll for at least 2 credits* in any session, short session or general 8-week summer session (DHH).\nNon-dissertators completing a summer doctoral degree must enroll for at least 2 credits* in the general 8-week summer session (DHH).\nNon-dissertator RAs must enroll for 2 credits* in the general 8-week summer session (DHH).\nNon-dissertator TAs and PAs not receiving a summer degree have no enrollment requirement. However, those who held such an appointment during the previous semester may qualify for summer tuition remission and are advised to consult with their employing department if they wish to enroll.\nNon-dissertator fellows with 12-month appointments are required to enroll for at least 2 credits* in the general 8-week summer session (DHH).\nNon-dissertator trainees are required to enroll for at least 2 credits* in the general 8-week summer session (DHH).\nInternational students who are completing a summer degree are required to enroll for at least 2 credits* in the general 8-week summer session (DHH).\nInternational students who are RAs in the summer are required to enroll for at least 2 credits* in the general 8-week summer session (DHH).\nInternational students who are not completing a summer degree and who are not RAs have no summer enrollment requirement mandated by the U.S. federal government regulations for F-1/J-1 visa holders.\n\nFinancial aid, loan deferral & taxes: In most cases, students are eligible for federal loans and federal loan payment deferral when enrolled at least half-time, which is 4 credits* for the fall and spring semesters. However, individual cases may vary, and students are advised to seek individual advice at the UW–Madison Office of Student Financial Aid. Payroll and FICA taxes can be impacted if students are not enrolled at least half-time. More information can be found here.\nFull-Time Enrollment Status at a Glance\nALL of the following credit requirements (except F-1 and J-1 visa requirements) must be satisfied by graded courses taken at 300 or above; courses numbered below 300, audit, and pass/fail do not satisfy enrollment requirements.\n\n\n\nCategories\nMinimum enrollment for full-time status: Fall or Spring\nMinimum enrollment for full-time status: Summer (general 8-week DHH session)\n\n\n\n\nDissertator\nExactly 3 credits directly related to research\nNot required unless receiving summer degree or if RA, trainee (with 12-month appointment), or fellow (with 12-month appointment), 3 cr. required.\n\n\nRA, non-dissertator\n8 cr.\n2 cr.\n\n\nTA/Lecturer (SA) 33%, non-dissertator\n6 cr.\nNot required unless receiving summer degree, 2 cr. minimum.\n\n\nTA/Lecturer (SA) 50%, non-dissertator\n4 cr.\nNot required unless receiving summer degree, 2 cr. minimum.\n\n\nPA 33%, non-dissertator\n6 cr.\nNot required unless receiving summer degree, 2 cr. minimum.\n\n\nPA 50%, non-dissertator\n4 cr.\nNot required unless receiving summer degree, 2 cr. minimum.\n\n\nFellow, non-dissertator\n8 cr.\n2 cr. for 12-month appointments.

The survey collects information on academic experiences, advising, and future plans.\nSurvey of Earned Doctorates (SED): The SED is a federally-sponsored national survey of individuals receiving research degrees from all U.S. institutions and the results are used to assess characteristics and trends in doctoral education. The SED is to be completed by PhD students, not DMA, DNP or AuD students.\nGraduate School Doctoral Exit Survey (DES): The Graduate School surveys all students graduating with a doctoral degree. The DES collects additional information on academic experiences, e.g., advising and other academic support.\nMaster’s Degree Completion Survey: All students completing master’s degrees are asked to answer a brief online survey about their plans for employment or for additional education. Students will receive an email with a link to the survey at the time of the final warrant request.\nThe doctoral exit surveys must be completed before submitting your dissertation electronically. Each individual survey will provide a certificate of completion once you have submitted the survey. The individual certificates of completion should each be saved as PDF documents to be uploaded in the administrative documents section of the ProQuest/UMI ETD Administrator website.\nDirections for completing the doctoral surveys are in the Graduate School’s Guide to Preparing your Doctoral Dissertation.\nSee Final Oral Examination (Defense)\n\n\n\n\nExtension Courses\n\nMore\n\n\n\nA student paying full-time tuition and fees at the UW–Madison campus may ask to take courses at UW–Extension for no additional cost (if the total credit load does not exceed the maximum allowable credit load). A student’s faculty advisor must submit a completed UW–Madison Tuition Waiver Request Form, along with a letter of endorsement to the Graduate School. If the Graduate School approves, the student may take the course without paying additional fees. Courses completed at UW–Extension do not fulfill the Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence, degree, or coursework credit requirements and will not appear on the student’s UW–Madison transcript. Dissertators are not allowed to request a tuition waiver while remaining eligible for the dissertator fee status, they would need to request to be removed from dissertator status and enroll full-time and pay fees at the regular graduate student fee rate.\nSee Dissertator Status, Enrollment Requirements, Overloads\n\n\n\n\nFailing Grades\n\nMore\n\n\n\nCourses numbered 300 and above graded F are included in the graduate GPA and do not count toward the Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence, degree, and coursework (50%) credit requirements.\nSee Grade Point Average (GPA) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Repeating Courses\n\n\n\n\nFamily Leave\n\nMore\n\n\n\nAlthough the Graduate School does not have a formal leave of absence policy for pre-dissertators, there are a number of family-friendly practices and resources for students considering taking a leave of absence for birth or adoption. Many departments and programs also have local policies. Students should consult with their program coordinator, advisor, and the Graduate School’s Office Academic Services as early as possible in their planning process.\nPlease visit the Graduate School’s Family and Parent Resources webpage for additional information.\nSee Compassionate Tuition Adjustment, Leave of Absence\n\n\n\n\nFellowships\n\nMore\n\n\n\nFellowships are monetary awards that students use to pursue graduate studies. In general, fellowships require no work obligations on the part of the recipient.\nCampus Fellowships: Merit-based campus and departmental fellowships are sometimes awarded to UW–Madison graduate students by their graduate programs. To inquire about eligibility and application procedures, students must contact their graduate program.\nExternal Fellowships: Many federal agencies, professional organizations, and private foundations provide fellowships for students pursuing graduate studies. Students are encouraged to look for and apply for external fellowships, and to understand the unique terms and conditions of each fellowship for which they apply. The Graduate School supports a number of federal/private fellowships through the provision of tuition support and health insurance. If students are awarded one of these fellowships, they should contact the UW–Madison Fellowship Officer at funding@grad.wisc.edu.\nInternational Fellowships: The Institute for Regional and International Studies serves as a resource center and provides information and support to faculty, students, and staff interested in identifying international research grants, scholarships, and other funding opportunities, including programs sponsored by Fulbright, National Security Education Program (Boren Scholarship), HEA (Higher Education Act), Title VI-FLAS (Foreign Languages and Area Studies), and other program competitions. Questions about funding for international research should be directed to the Institute for Regional and International Studies (IRIS).\nFor further information on fellowships, visit the Graduate School’s Funding Information webpage.\nSee Enrollment Requirements, International Students Maintaining Legal Status, Maximum Levels of Appointments, Tuition Remission, Payroll Benefits for Graduate Assistants, Fellows, and Trainees\n\n\n\n\nFinal Examination (Dissertation Defense)\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe final examination (often called “defense”) normally covers a student’s dissertation and areas of study. Students may not take the final examination until they have satisfied all other requirements for their degree. Students’ records must be cleared of incomplete grades and progress grades (other than research) before they can take the final exam.\nDoctoral students have five years from the date of passing their preliminary examinations to take their final examination and deposit their dissertation. Arrangements for the final examination and the  examination committee’s approval of the dissertation are the responsibilities of the student and the program. The graduate program coordinator must submit the final doctoral warrant request to the Graduate School at least three weeks before the final examination.\nAfter the graduate program coordinator submits the doctoral degree warrant request, the Graduate School will review this request and send the approved doctoral degree warrant to the graduate program coordinator. The final warrant should be printed out and committee member signatures should be obtained the defense. To pass the examination, students must receive no more than one dissenting vote from their committee. A missing signature is considered a dissent. Once the final warrant has been signed, an electronic copy should be uploaded in the administrative documents section of the ProQuest/UMI ETD Administrator website. The original signed hard copy of the final warrant should be kept with the student or the graduate program coordinator. For further information, visit the Graduate School’s Guide to Preparing Your Doctoral Dissertation.\nSee Preliminary Examinations, Time Limits\n\n\n\n\nFive-Year Rule\n\nMore\n\n\n\nStudents have five years from the date of their preliminary examination to take their final oral examination and deposit their dissertation.\nSee Preliminary Examinations, Time Limits\n\n\n\n\nForms\n\nMore\n\n\n\nAdd/Change Program\nCredit Overload\nLate Course Add\nLate Course Drop\nLate Initial Enrollment\nDegree Completion Fee Request\nTranscript Request\nWithdrawal\n\n\n\n\nGrade Change\n\nMore\n\n\n\nGrade changes originate with the instructor of the course. The instructor submits a grade change through the MyUW Faculty Center. Instructions are available through the Office of the Registrar’s Grading FAQ webpage. If the change cannot be completed via the online system, the instructor submits a paper Grade Change Form, and the program chair signs and submits it to the Graduate School Office of Academic Services.\nWhile changes from Incomplete or Progress to a final grade are routine and raise no questions, changes from one final grade to another are more serious matters. Doing extra work to improve a final grade is not allowed. Faculty legislation states that final grades can be changed only because of clerical error. Once an instructor announces course grades, a decision to re-evaluate the coursework for all or some of the students breaks faith with those students. The university’s primary concern is that all students in a course are treated consistently and fairly when assigned final grades.\n\n\n\n\nGrade Point Average (GPA) Requirement\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe Graduate School requires that students maintain a graduate grade-point average (GPA) of 3.00 (on a 4.00 scale) for all graduate courses (excluding research) to receive a degree. Many programs impose higher standards. Students should check with their program.\nWhen a graduate student’s cumulative GPA drops below a 3.0 for one semester, they are notified via email (copy to grad coordinator) that they are placed on academic probation, and an enrollment hold is placed on the following semester. Students on academic probation cannot continue enrolling until the probationary semester’s grades are reported and their cumulative GPA is above a 3.0.\nCourses taken for audit (S/NR), credit/no credit (CR/N), or pass/fail do not affect the GPA. Research courses graded on a Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) basis do not impact GPA. However, U grades are monitored by the Graduate School for satisfactory progress. A Permanent Incomplete (PI) grade does not impact the GPA. A No Report (NR) or Incomplete (I) grade does not impact the GPA, but in a graded course this is a temporary grade, indicating the instructor has not yet submitted a final grade.\nSee Auditing Courses, Credit/No Credit Grades, No Report (NR) Grades, Pass/Fail, Permanent Incomplete (PI) Grade, Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) Grades, Appendix 3 – Grading System, Appendix 4 – Grade-Point Average Calculation\n\n\n\n\nGrading System\n\nMore\n\n\n\nUW–Madison uses a 4.00 grading scale (A=4.00, AB=3.50, etc.). Grades are assigned only by instructors and are electronically reported by letter grade. Plus and minus grades are not used.\nStudents should check with individual professors about grading scales for specific courses.\nAll courses taken as a graduate student that are numbered 300 and above in which a student receives a grade of A, AB, B, BC, C, or S will count toward the Graduate School’s minimum credit requirement.  Courses with grades of P (“in progress”) fulfill the Graduate School’s minimum credit requirement only if they are research courses.  Courses taken under the 300 level, or for audit, pass/fail; or in which a  student receives grades of D or F do not count.\nFor courses listed as research, the only permissible final grades are P (Progress), S (Satisfactory), or U (Unsatisfactory). If a P grade is assigned, it will remain until the faculty member assigns a grade of S or U. All previously assigned P grades in research courses will revert to an S or U upon assignment of the final grade. Research courses (even with grades from terms earlier than Summer 1999) do not count in a student’s GPA. Research courses are traditionally reserved for graduate students; however, other students (Law, Medical, Undergraduate, etc.) occasionally enroll for a research course. In these cases, the student’s college can decide to have the course count in the GPA with an academic action submitted to the Office of the Registrar.\nTo convert UW–Madison Law School numerical grades to the Graduate School’s grading scale, the Graduate School uses the following scale:\n85-100 A\n83-84 AB\n77-82 B\n75-76 BC\n72-74 C\n67-71 D\n65-66 F\nInternational equivalencies may be available in the Wisconsin Directory of International Institutions.\nSee Grade Point Average (GPA) Requirement, Permanent Incomplete (PI) Grade, Progress (P) Grades, Grading System and GPA Calculation\n\n\n\n\nGrading System and GPA Calculation\n\nMore\n\n\n\nGrades are assigned only by instructors and are reported only by letter grade. Plus and minus grades are not accepted.\nThe university uses the following grading system:\nGrade Grade-points per credit\n\nA Excellent 4\nAB Intermediate 3.5\nB Good 3\nBC Intermediate 2.5\nC Fair 2\nD Poor 1\nF Failure 0\n\nThe following grades have no associated grade points and are excluded from the graduate Grade Point Average (GPA):\n\nS Satisfactory\nU Unsatisfactory\nI Incomplete (a temporary grade when work is not completed)\nP Progress\nPI Permanent Incomplete\nDR Dropped\nW Withdrew\nCR Credit\nN No Credit\nIN Incomplete in Credit/No Credit Course (a temporary grade when work is not completed)\nM Missing – used for audited courses\nNR No Report (a temporary grade for a graded course when a final grade has not been submitted by the instructor; a final grade for an audited course when the student did not meet the instructor’s minimum standards)\nNW No Work – used for non-attendance in a course\nQ Question on Credits\n\nGPA Calculation\n\nTo calculate graduate GPA:\n\nRefer to the list above to find the grade-point value of each letter grade on your transcript.\nMultiply the grade-point value by the number of credits for the course. For example, a three (3) credit AB would be calculated as:\n\n\n\n\n3.5\ngrade-points for an AB\n\n\n×\n3\ncredits\n\n\n\n10.5\ngrade-points\n\n\n\n\nContinue this calculation for every course numbered 300 and above that you took as a graduate student. Do include independent study courses and seminars. Do not include research courses; each department determines course numbers for their research courses. Do not include courses taken as a University Special student. Add the total number of grade points earned and the total number of credits earned.\nDivide the total number of grade points by the total number of credits.\n\n\n\n\n215\ngrade-points\n\n\n÷\n60\ncredits\n\n\n\n3.58\nGPA\n\n\n\n\nThis final figure is your graduate GPA.\n\n\n\nThe UW–Madison Cross College Advising Service GPA Calculator may be a useful tool.\n\n\n\n\nGraduate/Professional Certificates\n\nMore\n\n\n\nGraduate/professional certificates are available to all degree-seeking graduate and professional students (GRAD, LAW, MED, PHARM, VMED careers) and may be used by doctoral students in meeting their breadth requirement (see policy on Breadth Requirement in Doctoral Training). Graduate/professional certificate programs coordinate teaching and research among scholars active in interrelated disciplines. Consult the certificate program regarding recognition of program completion. Certificate programs monitor their own course and satisfactory progress requirements.\nStudents wishing to pursue a certificate must submit a request to add it to their academic career through the Add/Change/Discontinue application process in the MyGradPortal. This should be done as soon as a student knows they wish to add the certificate and before completing the classes for the certificate.  The certificate must be on the student’s academic career before the prelim (doctoral students) or degree warrant (master’s students) is requested.\nA list of all graduate/professional certificates with specific information for each is  available in the Graduate Guide on the Graduate/Professional Certificates page.\nSee Capstone Certificates\n\n\n\n\nGraduation\n\nMore\n\n\n\nTo receive a master’s degree, students contact their program coordinator at the beginning of the term in which they intend to graduate. The program coordinator will check that they have met program requirements and will request a warrant from the Graduate School on the student’s behalf. Students need to be enrolled in their program and taking a minimum of 2 credits (graded courses taken at 300 or above; audits and pass/fails do not satisfy this requirement) during the term in which they intend to graduate. For more information and deadlines visit the Graduate School’s Completing Your Master’s Degree webpage.\nDoctoral candidates’ major programs should request a final doctoral warrant at least 3 weeks before the anticipated date of their final dissertation defense. Doctoral candidates must be enrolled during the term in which they intend to defend or graduate. For more information and deadlines visit the Graduate School’s Completing Your Doctoral Degree webpage.\nSee Certification of Graduation (or ‘Degree Completion Letter’), Deadlines, Degree Completion Fee, Degree Conferral/Payroll End Dates, Dissertation and Thesis Standards and Publishing, Dissertation Defense (Final Examination)\n\n\n\n\nGrievances and Appeals\n\nMore\n\n\n\nIf a student feels unfairly treated or aggrieved by faculty, staff, or another student, the university offers several avenues to resolve the concern. All graduate programs, departments and schools/colleges have established specific grievance procedures for handling such situations; these grievance procedures are found in the program’s Graduate Guide page under the policy tab.\nThe department-school/college academic grievance process should be used to resolve academic issues or disputes. Examples of matters suitable for this process may include a qualifying exam failure, author dispute, or concerns regarding advising/mentoring, to name a few.\nGraduate Assistants in TA, PA and/or RA appointments may utilize the Graduate Assistantship Policies and Procedures (GAPP) grievance process to resolve employment-related issues. Examples of matters appropriate for the GAPP grievance process include allegations of violation of GAPP, including allegations excessive work hours, violations of sick days or vacation policies, or disputes regarding the assignment of duties.\nFor issues involving hostile and intimidating behavior (HIB) by a faculty or staff member, students should contact the Graduate School Assistant Dean for Academic Services for information on accessing the the appropriate HIB process.\nFor issues involving civil rights, ADA, Equal Opportunity or Sexual Misconduct, students should contact the Office of Compliance.\nIf you have questions about whether the grievance policy at the program level or GAPP procedure would be suitable for your concern, you are encouraged to reach out to your college, school or division human resources representative.\nThrough A Graduate Student Guide to Working with Faculty Advisors, an interactive, self-paced micro-course, graduate students learn about the characteristics of functional and dysfunctional relationships with faculty advisors, strategies for communicating effectively and aligning expectations, as well as program grievance processes and Hostile and Intimidating Behavior resources. Completion of the micro-course takes about 20 minutes and is optional but encouraged for all graduate students.\nIn addition, the following administrative offices have procedures available for addressing various concerns:\nOffice of Student Assistance and Support (for all issues of concern involving students)\n70 Bascom Hall\n608-263-5700\nEmployee Assistance Office (for conflicts involving graduate assistants and other employees)\nRm. 1109 WARF Building, 610 Walnut St.\n608-263-2987\nOmbuds Office for Faculty and Staff (for graduate students and post-docs, as well as faculty and staff)\n523-524 Lowell Center\n608-265-9992\nGraduate School (for informal advice at any level of review and for official appeals of program/departmental or school/college grievance decisions)\n217 Bascom Hall\n500 Lincoln Drive\nMadison, WI 53706-1380\n608-262-2433\nGraduate students have two levels of appeal when they disagree with the outcome of a grievance or academic decision made at the program/departmental level; these occur in sequence. The first appeal is to the school/college and final appeals are to the Graduate School.\nGraduate School Appeal Process\nGraduate students who believe their appeal was not appropriately handled or resolved at the school/college level may appeal to the Graduate School using the process described below. (For students in programs housed in the Graduate School, the appeal of a program decision will typically be handled by the school/college in which the faculty/academic advisor of the student has their tenure/primary appointment before an appeal may be considered by the Graduate School.)\nAppeals of school/college decisions to the Graduate School should be based upon one or both of the following grounds:\n\nThere was a procedural error that substantially affected the fairness or outcome of the school/college grievance or academic decision appeal process.\nThe information in the record does not support the school/college decision.\n\nIf a student believes that their appeal meets one or both grounds listed above, they may file an official appeal of a school/college decision with the Graduate School using the process described below.\nA student must submit an appeal to the Graduate School Assistant Dean for Academic Services within 14 calendar days of the school/college decision. Prior to submitting an appeal, students are encouraged to contact the Assistant Dean to obtain information about the process, timelines, and to seek clarification of any questions they may have about the process.\nTo be considered, appeals must include the following information:\n\nThe student’s name, local address, university email address and phone number.\nThe student’s program name and degree level.\nThe ground(s) upon which the appeal is based and for each ground stated, an explanation of why the student’s appeal meets those criteria.\nCopies of the department and school/college appeal decisions and any other relevant communications.\n\nUpon receipt of all the above materials:\n\nThe Assistant Dean for Academic Services will forward the appeal and related documents to the Dean of the Graduate School.\nThe student will be notified in writing within 10 calendar days after the appeal materials arrive in the Graduate School, acknowledging receipt of the formal appeal and giving the student a timeline for the appeal to be completed.\nThe program and school/college will be notified of the appeal to the Graduate School and will be provided with a copy of the student’s appeal statement and associated documents.  The program and school/college will be invited to submit a written response.\nThe dean will appoint an advisory committee comprised of faculty and/or staff with the appropriate expertise to evaluate the appeal.\nThe dean will charge the committee and set appropriate time frame (30 calendar days within the fall and spring semester; appeals received in the summer may take up to 60 calendar days) for completing a review and making a recommendation.\n\n\nThe committee will review the student’s appeal, including all the materials previously submitted. If necessary, the committee may request and review additional information relevant to the appeal from the student and/or program/department/School/College before making a recommendation.\nThe dean will issue the final decision in writing.\n\n\n\n\n\nHolds (Service Indicators)\n\nMore\n\n\n\nWhen using the enrollment system, students may encounter holds on their records, preventing them from enrolling in classes. Holds can also prevent students from obtaining a transcript, a degree completion letter, certification of status, or a diploma. Their enrollment notification will indicate the type of hold and where it must be cleared. Hold information is also available on MyUW. Students should direct questions to the originator of the hold.\nSee Dean’s Approval, Probation\n\n\n\n\nHonors Courses\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe Graduate School does not have an honors program, and graduate students may not enroll in Honors Only courses or in Honors Optional courses for honors credit or otherwise receive honors credit for completing optional extra work in a course. If a graduate student enrolls in a mixed graduate/undergraduate course section with an Honors Optional designation, the graduate student must maintain the default “do not take with honors” selection for their enrollment. If a graduate student does select “take with Honors” as part of their enrollment for such a course, the Graduate School will remove that Honors status.\n\n\n\n\nIncompletes\n\nMore\n\n\n\nStudents who are unable to complete coursework by the end of the semester may request from the instructor the assignment of the temporary grade of “I” (Incomplete).  Students making a request for an I grade must have been carrying passing grade until near the end of the term.  If the Incomplete grade is granted the student should complete the missing work as soon as possible.  Students who receive an Incomplete grade will receive a warning message from the Graduate School, reminding them that students are not permitted to graduate with an Incomplete grade on their transcripts. Graduate students are allowed the subsequent semester of enrollment to complete the coursework before the Graduate School will place the student on academic probation. Programs may impose more stringent rules for satisfactory progress.\nIn consultation with the program, students may be dismissed from the Graduate School for failing to complete coursework and receive a final grade in a timely fashion.\nStudents with outstanding Incomplete grades may not receive  dissertator status or be granted a degree.\nIf the work is no longer relevant, the instructor of a course is no longer at the university, or a change of program makes completion of the work unnecessary, students may be allowed to receive a Permanent Incomplete (PI) for the course. The instructor of the course or their advisor submits a grade change request with an explanation or reason, changing the grade from I to PI. The Office of the Registrar also converts any incomplete grade over 5 years old to PI. Students may graduate with PI’s on their transcript.\nUnresolved Incomplete grades lapse to a grade of Permanent Incomplete (PI) after five years.\nSee Permanent Incomplete (PI) Grade, Probation, Satisfactory Progress\n\n\n\n\nIndividual Development Plan\n\nMore\n\n\n\nUW–Madison recommends all graduate students and postdoctoral researchers utilize Individual Development Plans to set academic and career goals and facilitate conversations with their mentor(s). All graduate students and postdoctoral researchers supported by NIH funding are required to have an Individual Development Plan (IDP). Other funding agencies may have additional requirements related to the IDP.\nIDPs are written plans that give mentees ownership and structure to assess their skills, interests, and values, define clear and actionable goals, explore career options, and facilitate conversations with their mentor(s). IDP forms vary greatly, although many are structured around core competencies or learning outcomes. The onus for writing, maintaining, and implementing the plan is on the mentee, and conversations with and feedback from the mentor(s) are essential.\nThe Graduate School will identify individuals who must complete an IDP and will notify them of tools and resources available. The Graduate School will offer graduate students, postdocs, and PIs tools to track IDP progress. The IDP tracking tool will log activity related to the IDP, but the actual contents of the IDP will not be captured by the tracking tool. The contents of the IDP are private to the mentee, who chooses which parts of the IDP to share with his or her selected mentor(s). Find the IDP template for graduate students and postdoc mentees, guidelines and other supporting resources for mentors and mentees, resources for PIs and grants administrators, including the IDP tracking tool.\n\n\n\n\nInsurance and Medical Benefits\n\nMore\n\n\n\nIf students have been awarded a fellowship, traineeship, or an assistantship with at least a one-third (33%) appointment per term (or an equivalent), they qualify for full medical benefits. In order to activate medical insurance benefits, students contact their department’s/program’s benefits coordinator.\nStudents who are currently enrolled as UW–Madison students and have paid segregated fees can also use the services of University Health Services (UHS). University Health Services is the health clinic on campus, open to any current UW–Madison student (excluding guest students). UHS offers insurance through SHIP (Student Health Insurance Plan), which is located on the premises. SHIP is a comprehensive insurance plan for UW–Madison students that covers additional health care costs incurred both at UHS and elsewhere. This includes travel and meningitis immunizations, prescription drugs, and oral contraceptives at UHS as well as after hours, emergency room, hospitalization, and other specialized medical services locally and nationwide.\nFor more information or questions, contact UHS or SHIP.\nInternational students, or visiting J-1 scholars, and their visa dependents residing in the U.S. must meet the mandatory health insurance requirements of UW–Madison. International students must show compliance with these requirements by registering with the SHIP office. Students may register either by enrolling in the SHIP Health Plan or by filing a waiver application (if they satisfy the qualifying conditions). Failure to register by the specified deadlines will result in a $100 late fee in addition to any required SHIP premiums.\nPlease note: Students do not have to file a waiver if they have employment through UW–Madison and they meet all of the following conditions:\n\nThey are employed at UW–Madison and are receiving full medical benefits which were effective on or before September 1 (for fall) or February 1 (for spring/summer).\nThey are a member of one of the following health insurance plans: Group Health Cooperative, Unity Health Plans, Physicians Plus, Dean Health Care, or Standard Plan.\nThey are the primary subscriber (not a dependent) of their health insurance plan.\n\nIf a student meets all of the above criteria, the SHIP office will file an automatic waiver on his/her behalf.\nAdditional information regarding SHIP, including enrollment and waiver policies, can be found here.\nGraduate students traveling abroad for study or research are encouraged to acquire international health insurance through Cultural Insurance Services International (CISI). All University of Wisconsin students studying/traveling abroad under a UW sponsored program must enroll in health insurance through CISI). Further information about international health insurance can be found here.\nSee Benefits, Appendix 2 – Payroll Benefits\n\n\n\n\nJoint Degrees\n\nMore\n\n\n\nA joint degree consists of one graduate degree with two programs. A student completing a joint degree writes one thesis or dissertation and receives one diploma. Students can earn a joint master’s or a joint doctoral degree. Such degrees are relatively rare. Students should inquire with each program prior to enrollment to see if additional policies exist that would restrict the ability to complete a joint degree.\nTo apply for a joint degree a student must submit a proposal for the degree to the Graduate School along with an electronic Add/Change/Discontinue Program Request. A student must be admitted to the second program. An appropriate Associate Dean of the Graduate School reviews all such proposals.\nStudents must submit the proposal before they complete the coursework and no later than the beginning of their second year of graduate study.\nThe joint degree proposal must address the following issues:\n\nReasons for seeking a joint degree, rather than following the traditional program/minor curriculum (for doctoral programs that require a minor) or double degrees curriculum (for master’s programs).\nCoursework necessary to satisfy each program’s requirements; two separate course lists required.\nThe required content of each program’s portion of the degree requirements in the proposal (for example, preliminary exam arrangements for the doctoral degree or a joint thesis required for the master’s degree, etc.).\n\nTo receive a joint degree, students must:\n\nBe admitted to both programs, with approval of their proposal from both programs;\nComplete the degree requirements in each program as outlined in the proposal;\nFulfill the Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence, degree, and coursework (50%) credit requirements.\nBe recommended for the degree by the faculty co-chairs/advisors from each program and the program director from each program, approval signatures required.\n\nOnce a joint degree proposal has been reviewed and approved, any and all changes must be submitted to the Graduate School for further review.\nFor further details about joint degrees, contact the Graduate School Office of Academic Services.\nSee Double Degrees, Dual Degrees: Graduate and Professional Combination, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Special Graduate Committee Degrees, Appendix 5 – Double, Joint, and Dual Degrees at a Glance\n\n\n\n\nJury Duty\n\nMore\n\n\n\nIf a student is called to jury duty and the duty is sustained over a period of three weeks or more, the student should be allowed to withdraw from classes. If extended jury duty should continue after the last day of class, the instructor has the option of assigning an Incomplete (I) as the student’s grade. The I grade will not result in academic probation or the removal of dissertator status. Further information is available at Graduate School’s Office of Academic Services.\n\n\n\n\nLanguage Requirements\n\nMore\n\n\n\nEach program sets its own language requirements. Some programs require competence in one or more languages before students can take preliminary examinations. Students must check with their major program’s criteria for satisfactory progress in the program’s student handbook, or in the Graduate Guide.\n\n\n\n\nLate Enrollment/Late Course Change/Late Drop\n\nMore\n\n\n\nIt is a student’s responsibility to be aware of the deadlines for enrollment each term. All session deadlines are adhered to as detailed on the Office of the Registrar’s Enrollment Deadlines page.\nLate Initial Enrollment: Students have through the end of the second week to enroll in courses for fall or spring term. If students enroll after the first week of class, they are subject to late payment fees. Permission to enroll late does not excuse students from paying late initial enrollment and/or late payment penalties. Exceptions to the published deadlines will be granted only in the case of truly mitigating circumstances. Late initial enrollment cannot be completed in MyUW; a Late initial Enrollment Request Form must be submitted along with written approval from the student’s faculty advisor. Refer to the chart below for detailed steps to late initial enrollment.\nLate course changes (add a class, change credit, change sections): After deadlines have passed, late course adds can be requested by submitting a completed Late Course Add Request Form to the Graduate School. Other courses changes may be requested via the Course Change Request in MyUW. For more information, see the Registrar’s Office enrollment overview.  For all changes, the Course Change Request must be printed from MyUW and required signatures must be obtained along with written approval from the student’s faculty advisor. Refer to the chart below for detailed steps to late course changes. The Dean’s signature will be fulfilled once submitted to the Graduate School.\nLate Drop: The electronic Course Change Request process via MyUW Student Center is not accessible for late drops. Students must complete the Graduate School Late Course Drop Request Form along with written justification from the student’s faculty advisor. Please note that poor academic performance in a course is not an acceptable reason for a late drop request.  Refer to the chart below for detailed steps to late drops.\n\n\n\nAction\nWhen During the Semester\nStudent’s Process\n\n\n\n\nLate Initial Enrollment:\nAfter the 2nd week of class (fall/spring terms, different deadlines apply for summer sessions)\n\n\nStudents must fill out the Late Initial Enrollment Request Form and obtain all required signatures.\nStudents must obtain written approval from their faculty advisor.\nEmail the Late Initial Enrollment Request From and faculty advisor approval to the Graduate School at Academic Services.\n\n\n\n\nLate Course Change (Add/Change Credit/Change Section)\nAfter the 9th week of classes (fall/spring terms, different deadlines apply for summer sessions)\n\n\nFor late course adds, students must complete and submit a Late Course Add Request form.    For credit/section changes, students must complete an electronic Course Change Request in MyUW, print the form and obtain required signatures.\nStudents must obtain written approval from their faculty advisor.\nEmail the form and written approval to the Graduate School at Academic Services.\n\n\n\n\nLate Drop\nSee Registrar’s Office  Dates/Deadlines page for specific drop deadline information (fall/spring terms, different deadlines apply for summer sessions)\n\n\nStudents must fill out the Late Course Drop Form and obtain all required signatures.\nStudents must obtain written justification from their faculty advisor.\nEmail the Late Course Drop Form and written justification to the Graduate School at Academic Services.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more information about late enrollment, late course change or late drop, contact the Graduate School Office of Academic Services.\nSee Course Changes, Dean’s Approval\n\n\n\n\nLeave of Absence\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe Graduate School does not have a formal policy on leave of absence for pre-dissertators. Students should notify their graduate program of their intention to take a leave of absence.\nIf students have pre-enrolled for a future term and plan to take a leave of absence, they must be sure to drop all courses before the first day of class.\nPreviously enrolled students who wish to return to Graduate School should follow the instructions for Readmission to Graduate School. Any student who does not enroll for a fall or spring term is considered to be a reentry and must pay the Graduate School online application fee. Any student granted readmission must adhere to the most current requirements as listed in the Graduate School Academic Policies & Procedures. Master’s degree students who have been absent for five or more consecutive years lose all credits that they have earned before their absence. Doctoral degree students who have been absent for ten or more consecutive years lose all credits that they have earned before their absence. Individual programs may count the coursework students completed prior to their absence for meeting program requirements; however that coursework will not count toward Graduate School credit requirements.\nNon-dissertators: The Graduate School has no formal policy regarding a leave of absence at the pre-dissertator level, although some programs do. Therefore, it is critical that students contact their major programs before considering a break in enrollment of one or more terms.\nDissertators: A candidate for a doctoral degree should be aware that failure to take the final oral examination and submit the dissertation within 5 years after passing the preliminary examination may require another preliminary examination and admittance to candidacy a second time. In addition, the Graduate School requires all dissertators to maintain continuous enrollment. In rare circumstances when this is not possible, a degree completion fee is assessed to recognize the inevitable use of university facilities (including faculty and staff time) up to and including the successful defense of the dissertation.\nInternational Students: International students considering a leave of absence should check on their visa status with International Student Services.\nGraduate Appointments: Students with Teaching Assistantships (TA), Program Assistantships (PA), or Research Assistantships (RA) should consult with their program, their PI and/or advisor. Students with Fellowships or Traineeships should contact their funding source.\nSee Degree Completion Fee, Family Leave, International Students Maintaining Legal Status, Readmission to Graduate School (for previously enrolled graduate students), Time Limits\n\n\n\n\nMaximum Credits per Term\n\nMore\n\n\n\nNon-dissertator students are allowed to enroll for a maximum of 15 credits. The enrollment system counts all credits in determining maximum credit loads. Even though pass/fail courses, audit courses, and 100- or 200-level courses are considered undergraduate level credits, they are counted in total credit load.\nSee Enrollment Requirements\n\n\n\n\nMaximum Levels of Appointments\n\nMore\n\n\n\nUniversity policy restricts appointment levels for Project, Research, or Teaching Assistants; fellows; trainees; and university staff who are enrolled as graduate students. The levels established by the university are maximums, not minimums or expected levels.\nProject Assistant (PA) and Teaching Assistant (TA)\nAppointments exceeding 75% for domestic students are rare and require approval of the advisor and chair of the payrolling program(s), the payrolling college dean’s office(s), and the Graduate School. Some colleges, schools, or programs may set lower limits, but in general require prior specific approvals if the appointment or some combination of appointments exceeds 75%. Project Assistants may be employed 100% during summer term, semester breaks, and spring vacation. International students cannot have an appointment exceeding 50% during the spring and fall terms. International students should refer to information from International Student Services for additional appointment restrictions.\nResearch Assistant (RA)\nAppointments exceeding 50% are not permitted. Domestic students may have a combination of appointments not exceeding 75% with no more than 50% being the RA appointment. International students cannot have any combination of a RA and another appointment over 50%. International students should refer to information from International Student Services for additional appointment restrictions.\nPredoctoral Fellows/Trainees\nStudents can hold a concurrent appointment as a TA, RA, PA, or student hourly with their fellowship within the limits set out in the current university policy. Whenever assistantships (RA, TA, or PA) are combined with fellowships or traineeships, total compensation cannot exceed the full-time RA rate of the student’s academic home department, as it was reported to the Graduate School for the current year (fellowship/traineeship + assistantship = total compensation). The list of approved program rates can be found on the Graduate Assistantships webpage, under Assistantship Stipends by Program. More information about concurrent appointment policy for fellows/trainees can be found in the University of Wisconsin–Madison Policy for Supplementation and Concurrent Appointments for Graduate Students Holding Predoctoral Fellowships or Traineeships.\nLimited/Academic Staff, Non-dissertators\nCombinations of appointment percentages and academic load percentage exceeding 175% are very unusual because of the difficulty that such academic loads place on the ability of the employee to perform their responsibilities. Therefore, approval by the employing division’s dean/director (or designee) is required prior to the start of classes. The Graduate School dean should be informed in writing of any approved requests. See Chapter 11.03 of the Unclassified Personnel Policies and Procedures document for the current university policy entitled, Employees Enrolled as UW–Madison Students.\nLimited/Academic Staff, Dissertators\nCombinations of appointment percentages and academic load percentage exceeding 175% are more common because dissertators have no classes to attend. Although these are approved only at the program chair or director level, the employing unit’s dean/director (or designee) and the Dean of the Graduate School must be informed in writing of any approved requests. See Chapter 11.03 of the Unclassified Personnel Policies and Procedures document for the current university policy entitled, Employees Enrolled as UW–Madison Students.\nStudent hourly\nIn some situations it may be appropriate to hire graduate students as student hourly help. Employers should contact their Dean’s office to determine when this is appropriate. Maximum levels for appointments also include student hourly appointments. See Chapter 1.06 of the Unclassified Personnel Policies and Procedures document for the current university policy entitled, Student Hourly Help.\nFor any combination of appointments (except fellowships and traineeships), the total appointment percentage may not exceed 75%.\nA 100% academic load for graduate students is:\n\nNon-dissertators: Fall or spring terms, 8 graded credits in courses numbered 300 or above; summer sessions, 4 graded credits in courses numbered 300 or above.\nDissertators: Fall, spring, or summer, 3 graded credits numbered 300 or above.\n\nIf a student holds an assistantship concurrently with a staff appointment, the combination of appointments may not exceed 75%, regardless of the number of credits for which the student is enrolled.\nFurther information about maximum levels of appointments can be found in the University of Wisconsin–Madison Maximum Levels of Graduate Assistantship Appointments Policy\nSee Enrollment Requirements,\n\n\n\n\nMinimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe minimum graduate coursework (50%) requirement states that at least 50% of credits applied toward the program’s graduate degree credit requirement must be courses designed for graduate work (this includes but is not limited to online, thesis/research, independent study, and practicum/internship credits).  Courses taken as a University Special student are not allowed to count toward the 50% graduate coursework minimum unless taken at the 700 level or above.\nFor students taking coursework through the fall 2015 term, the official university record which identifies programs documented “graduate level” coursework is each program’s Minimum Degree Requirements and Satisfactory Progress chart in the 2014-2016 Graduate School catalog.  The official University documentation of “graduate level” coursework is identified with the graduate course attribute (G50%) in the University’s Course Guide and Class Search. More information regarding the course attribute can be found on the Academic Planning and Institutional Research (APIR) website.\nStudents should be aware that some programs may require more rigorous credit minimums than the Graduate School’s minimum. Students should visit their program’s Minimum Degree Requirements and Satisfactory Progress chart and contact their graduate program coordinator for program specific degree requirements.\nSee Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Prior Coursework, University Special Student Status, Time Limits\n\n\n\n\nMinimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe Graduate School’s minimum graduate degree credit requirement is a degree requirement instituted by the Graduate Faculty Executive Committee to ensure that a graduate degree meets institution accreditation standards (this includes but is not limited to online, thesis/research, independent study, and practicum internships credits).\nGraduate Degree Credit Minimums\nMaster’s Degree: 30 credits\n(except MFA)\nM.F.A. /Specialist Certificate: 42 credits\n(may include master’s degree credits taken at UW–Madison)\nDoctoral Degree: 51 credits\n(may include master’s degree credits taken at UW–Madison and credits take while a dissertator)\nThe doctoral degree minimum graduate degree credit requirement may be achieved with credits earned before or after dissertator status. The credits applied towards a master’s degree, a doctoral minor, or taken as a dissertator shall count towards the related doctoral graduate degree credit requirement.\nStudents should be aware that some programs may require more rigorous credit requirements than the Graduate School’s minimum requirements. Students should contact their graduate program coordinator for further information.\nSee Dissertator Status, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Prior Coursework, Time Limits\n\n\n\n\nMinimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence credit requirement for graduation can be satisfied only with courses numbered 300 and above taken as a graduate student at UW–Madison (this includes but is not limited to online, thesis/research, independent study, practicum/internship credits).\nGraduate Residence Credit Minimums:\nMaster’s degree: 16 credits\n(except MFA)\nMFA/Specialist certificate: 24 credits\n(may include Master’s degree credits taken at UW–Madison)\nDoctoral degree: 32 credits\n(must be completed prior to achieving dissertator status; may include master’s degree credits taken at UW–Madison)\nIn rare circumstances, courses taken as a University Special student maybe allowed to count toward the minimum graduate residence credit requirement. These credits generally are not allowed to count toward the 50% graduate coursework minimum.\nCredits applied to the minimum graduate residence credit requirement must be earned while enrolled as a graduate student at UW–Madison and can also count toward the minimum graduate degree credit requirement.\nStudents should be aware that some programs may require more rigorous credit requirements than the Graduate School’s minimum requirements. Students should contact their graduate program coordinator for further information.\nSee Dissertator Status, Grading System, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Pass/Fail, Prior Coursework, Progress (P) Grades, Time Limits, Traveling Scholar Program\n\n\n\n\nMinnesota/Wisconsin Reciprocity\n\nMore\n\n\n\nMinnesota residents who are certified by the Minnesota Office of Higher Education (MOHE) for the appropriate term/summer session to attend UW–Madison under the Minnesota-Wisconsin Tuition Reciprocity Agreement will be assessed the approved reciprocity tuition rate, plus the segregated fees assessed for all UW–Madison students. Students under this program will be classified as nonresidents of Wisconsin.\nStudents with a Research Assistantship (RA), that covers all instructional costs, will be billed as nonresidents, not Minnesota reciprocity rates. The end result to the student is the same, as students are only responsible for the segregated fees.\nStudents who are not certified for the program prior to the date fees are due must either pay nonresident rates and be refunded the difference in tuition upon certification by MOHE, or delay payment until certification is issued and include the $100.00 late payment fee due at that time.\nIt is the student’s responsibility to inquire of MOHE about the suitability of reapplying, application procedures, and deadlines.

Graduate students who have been found by their instructors to commit academic misconduct can expect that the Office for Student Conduct and Community Standards will consider whether to impose a further disciplinary sanction of university probation, suspension, or expulsion.\nChapter 14 of the University of Wisconsin Administrative Code defines academic misconduct as follows:\nAcademic misconduct is an act in which a student:\n\nseeks to claim credit for the work or efforts of another without authorization or citation;\nuses unauthorized materials or fabricated data in any academic exercise;\nforges or falsifies academic documents or records;\nintentionally impedes or damages the academic work of others;\nengages in conduct aimed at making false representation of a student’s academic performance; or\nassists other students in any of these acts. UWS 14.03(1)\n\nExamples of academic misconduct include but are not limited to:\n\ncutting and pasting text from the Web without quotation marks or proper citation;\nparaphrasing from the Web without crediting the source;\nusing notes or a programmable calculator in an exam when such use is not allowed;\nusing another person’s ideas, words, or research and presenting it as one’s own by not properly crediting the originator;\nstealing examinations or course materials;\nchanging or creating data in a lab experiment;\naltering a transcript;\nsigning another person’s name to an attendance sheet;\nhiding a book knowing that another student needs it to prepare for an assignment;\ncollaboration that is contrary to the stated rules of the course; or\ntampering with a lab experiment or computer program of another student.\n\nThe full text of the state statute governing academic misconduct, University of Wisconsin System (UWS) 14, Student Academic Disciplinary Procedures, as well as the UW–campus procedures for implementing the provisions of UWS 14 and general information about academic misconduct, are available here or from the Division of Student Life.\n\n\n\n\nMisconduct, Non-Academic\n\nMore\n\n\n\nChapter 17 of the University of Wisconsin Administrative Code describes non-academic misconduct as follows:\nThe university may discipline a student in non-academic matters in the following situations:\n\nfor conduct which constitutes a serious danger to the personal safety of a member of the university community or guest;\nfor stalking or harassment;\nfor conduct that seriously damages or destroys university property or attempts to damage or destroy university property, or the property of a member of the university community or guest;\nfor conduct that obstructs or seriously impairs university-run or university-authorized activities, or that interferes with or impedes the ability of a member of the university community, or guest, to participate in university-run or university-authorized activities;\nfor unauthorized possession of university property or property of another member of the university community or guest;\nfor acts which violate the provisions of UWS 18, Conduct on University Lands;\nfor knowingly making a false statement to any university employee or agent on a university-related matter, or for refusing to identify oneself to such employee or agent;\nfor violating a standard of conduct, or other requirement or restriction imposed in connection with disciplinary action.\n\nExamples of non-academic misconduct include but are not limited to:\n\nengaging in conduct that is a crime involving danger to property or persons, as defined in UWS 18.06(22)(d);\nattacking or otherwise physically abusing, threatening to physically injure, or physically intimidating a member of the university community or a guest;\nattacking or throwing rocks or other dangerous objects at law enforcement personnel, or inciting others to do so;\nselling or delivering a controlled substance, as defined in 161 Wis. Stats., or possessing a controlled substance with intent to sell or deliver;\nremoving, tampering with, or otherwise rendering useless university equipment or property intended for use in preserving or protecting the safety of members of the university community, such as fire alarms, fire extinguisher, fire exit signs, first aid equipment, or emergency telephones; or obstructing fire escape routes;\npreventing or blocking physical entry to or exit from a university building, corridor, or room;\nengaging in shouted interruptions, whistling, or similar means of interfering with a classroom presentation or a university-sponsored speech or program;\nobstructing a university officer or employee engaged in the lawful performance of duties;\nobstructing or interfering with a student engaged in attending classes or participating in university-run or university-authorized activities;\nknowingly disrupting access to university computing resources or misusing university computing resources.\n\nThe full text of the state statute governing non-academic misconduct, UWS 17, Student Non-Academic Misconduct Disciplinary Procedures, as well as the UW campus procedures for implementing the provisions of UWS 17 and general information about non-academic misconduct, are available here or from the Division of Student Life.\n\n\n\n\nNo Report (NR) Grades\n\nMore\n\n\n\nA No Report (NR) grade on a student’s record indicates that the instructor for the course has not yet submitted a final grade for the student’s work at the end of the grading period. This grade is not the same as an Incomplete (I), which indicates that the student’s work was unfinished at the end of the term.\nAll grades for 790, 890, 990 that are unreported (previously assigned an NR) by the end of the grading period will be automatically assigned a P (Progress). The P grades will automatically revert to S grades upon assignment of the grade for the final semester of enrollment in the course. If the instructors had intended a different grade (S, U, or I), they would need to use the electronic grade change process.\nSee Grading System, Incomplete Grades, Progress (P) Grades, Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) Grades\n\n\n\n\nOverloads\n\nMore\n\n\n\nStudents are allowed to enroll for a maximum of 15 credits during fall and spring. Summer maximum enrollment is 12 credits. Credits included are those courses numbered 300 or above, taken for a grade (not including audits and pass/fail).\nDissertators are not eligible for overloads in the fall or spring terms. However, in the summer, a dissertator who is enrolled in the general 8-week session for 3 credits may request an overload for 1-2 additional credits in a short session and still retain dissertator status.  For such requests to be approved, the course must be related to dissertation research or professional training that is not offered in regular semesters. Faculty advisors can request an overload exception for summer from the Graduate School Degree Coordinator.\nThe enrollment system counts all credits in determining maximum credit loads. An overload request is required if a student wishes to exceed the maximum number of credits they are allowed as a graduate student. Even though pass/fail courses, audit courses, and 100- or 200-level courses are not considered graduate level credits, they are counted in a total credit load. An overload request is also required if the number of credits exceeds the span of weeks in any short session during the summer (but not for a dissertator).\nIf a student wishes to enroll for more than the maximum credit load, they must submit a Credit Overload Request form, signed by their advisor, to the Graduate School Office of Academic Services. The Graduate School will look closely at the rationale for the request, the student’s course load, satisfactory progress, and assistantships. Overloads to 16-17 credits during the fall and spring semesters are generally allowed. Overloads to 18 credits are only approved for fall/spring if some of the credits are taken in a short term prior to or during the semester  If the Graduate School approves the overload, the student will then be allowed to add the course.\nSee Enrollment Requirements, Maximum Levels of Appointments\n\n\n\n\nPass/Fail Courses\n\nMore\n\n\n\nPass/fail courses do not satisfy any Graduate School credit, coursework, or degree requirements, nor do they fulfill minimum or maximum credits required each term. Tuition is still charged for pass/fail course. For these reasons, very few graduate students choose pass/fail for courses numbered 300 or above. Seminars, independent study, and research may not be taken pass/fail. The pass/fail option is not to be confused with the S/U grading option.\nStudents requesting to enroll in a course as pass/fail must first enroll or be enrolled in the course.  The request is made via the MyUW Student Center by submitting an online Course Change Request, changing the course to pass/fail. After the student requests this change online via MyUW Student Center, they submit the pass/fail form to the Graduate School either electronically at gsacserv@grad.wisc.edu or in person in room 217 Bascom Hall where it is reviewed and approved by the Graduate School.  The deadline to request/cancel pass/fail is the drop deadline, which is the end of the 9th week of class during the fall and spring semester. Requests for late pass/fail will not be considered. Specific deadline dates, including those for summer sessions, are posted prior to each semester by the Office of the Registrar.\nThe instructor does not know that a student is taking the course on a pass/fail basis and therefore reports a letter grade for the course. The Registrar records a grade of S in place of the instructors’ grades of A, AB, B, BC, or C; and a grade of U in place of D or F grades. Neither the S nor the U are computed in the graduate grade-point average.\nThe enrollment system counts all credits in determining maximum credit loads. A Credit Overload Request is required if a student’s total credit load exceeds the maximum limit per term.\nSee Dean’s Approval, Enrollment Requirements, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Overloads, Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) Grades\n\n\n\n\nPayroll Benefits for Graduate Assistants, Fellows, and Trainees\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFellow\nTrainee\nResearch Assistant\nProject Assistant\nTeaching Assistant\n\n\n\n\nSubject to State and Federal Income Taxes\nyes1\nyes1\nyes\nyes\nyes\n\n\nWithholding\nno2\nno2\nyes\nyes\nyes\n\n\nSubject to FICA Tax\nno\nno\nno3\nno3\nno3\n\n\nW2\nno4\nno4\nyes\nyes\nyes\n\n\nHealth Insurance (if at least 33% time appointment or an equivalent*)\nyes\nyes\nyes\nyes\nyes\n\n\nRemission of nonresident portion of tuition (if at least 33% time appointment or an equivalent*)\nyes\nno\nyes, unless student is enrolled in a service-based pricing program5\nyes, unless student is enrolled in a service-based pricing program5\nyes, unless student is enrolled in a service-based pricing program5\n\n\nRemission of resident portion of tuition (if at least 33% time appointment or an equivalent*)\nno\nno\nyes6, unless student is enrolled in a service-based pricing program5\nyes6, unless student is enrolled in a service-based pricing program5\nyes6, unless student is enrolled in a service-based pricing program5\n\n\nVacation\nno\nvaries\nyes\nyes\nno\n\n\nSick Leave\nno\nvaries\nyes\nyes\nyes\n\n\n\n1 May deduct tuition, fees, and books from stipends when calculating taxable income.\n2 Except international students.

The instructor of the course or their advisor submits a grade change request with an explanation or reason, changing the grade from I to PI. The Office of the Registrar also converts any incomplete grade over 5 years old to PI. Students may graduate with PI’s on their transcript.\nSee Incomplete Grades\n\n\n\n\nPortal (MyGradPortal)\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe Graduate Portal is an online resource for students and graduate coordinators. Students use the Portal to complete academic actions such as adding or changing their major, discovering professional development opportunities, and submitting payment for the completion of their doctoral degrees. Graduate Coordinators request degree warrants (master’s, preliminary exams, and doctoral) through the Portal.  Students should spend time becoming familiar with the Portal and its features.\nAccessing MyUW and the Graduate Student Portal\n\nGo to wisc.edu and open your MyUW in the top red banner. Then click on MyUW Home.\nEnter your NetID login information.\nClick on the tile “Graduate Student Portal”. If you do not see the tile, you can search for it in the top search bar and add it to your page.\n\nInitiating a request in the Portal\n\nOnce in your Portal page, select the tile on the home page titled “Add/Change Programs.”\nIn the “Enrolled Programs” section, you will have options to add a Graduate/Professional certificate, doctoral minor (PhD students only), or major. You also have the option to discontinue a program in which you are already enrolled.\n\nChoosing an action button will display an associated window, which will show fields appropriate for the type of request.\n\n\n\n\nPreliminary Examinations\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe preliminary examination is a significant milestone in a doctoral student’s academic career. It is given to assess knowledge of areas within the academic discipline. Passing of the preliminary area exam, obtaining approval of the minor if the major program requires it, and completing all the major course requirements culminate in admission to candidacy for the doctoral degree.\nStudents’ eligibility to take the prelim examination(s) is determined by their program. The program notifies the Graduate School of a student’s admission to candidacy on the preliminary warrant, which must be requested 3 weeks prior to the exam date. The number of examinations and their content vary from program to program. A student’s program administers the examination(s).\nAfter passing the preliminary examination, students have 5 years to take the final examination (i.e. dissertation defense) and deposit their dissertation. The 5-year clock starts on the first day of instruction of the term (Fall, Spring, or Summer) immediately following the completion of the preliminary examination. Failure to complete their degree within this period may result in students having to retake the preliminary examination and be re-admitted to candidacy.\nTime limit extension for dissertators impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic\nTo offer flexibility amidst the major disruption that COVID-19 may have had on doctoral candidates’ research and scholarship progress, students who achieved dissertator status by the end of the 2020 summer term have automatically had the 5-year time limit extended by 8 months. Dissertators given this 8-month extension who need more time due to continued COVID-related disruption to their progress may request a further extension from the Graduate School. Decisions to extend the deadline beyond the additional 8 months are made on a case-by-case basis upon request of the student and approval of their advisor. Upon advisor approval, the advisor then requests an extension from the Graduate School by submitting the request to the PhD degree coordinator at gsacserv@grad.wisc.edu.\nSee Certificate of Doctoral Candidacy, Dissertator Status, Time Limits, Warrants\n\n\n\n\nPrior Coursework\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe Graduate School does not transfer credits for previous coursework.  However, a student’s program may decide to accept coursework completed outside of the student’s graduate career at UW–Madison under the conditions detailed below.  Any prior coursework accepted under these parameters must have been rigorous and meet the expectations of a graduate work for the degree. Coursework earned five or more years prior to admission to a master’s degree or coursework earned ten or more years prior to admission to a doctoral degree is not allowed to satisfy requirements.\nSatisfying Requirements with Prior Graduate Coursework from Other Institutions\nA student’s program may decide to accept graduate coursework completed at another institution (earned post-baccalaureate) toward fulfillment of minimum degree, minimum graduate coursework, and minor credit requirements. This work will not appear on a UW–Madison transcript nor count towards the graduate career GPA. The Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence credit requirement can be satisfied only with courses taken as a graduate student at UW–Madison. The only exception is graduate-level coursework taken as a Big Ten Academic Alliance Traveling Scholar.\nSatisfying Requirements with Coursework from Undergraduate Career at UW–Madison\nFor well-prepared advanced students, a student’s program may decide to accept up to seven credits numbered 300 or above of required or elective courses from the undergraduate work completed at UW–Madison towards fulfillment of minimum degree and minor credit requirements. However, this work would not be allowed to count toward the 50% graduate coursework minimum unless taken at the 700 level or above. This work will not appear on the graduate career portion of UW–Madison transcript nor count towards the graduate career GPA. The Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence credit requirement can be satisfied only with courses taken as a graduate student at UW–Madison.\nSatisfying Requirements with Coursework from Undergraduate Career outside of UW-Madison (Policy on Exceptions for Specialized Accreditation to Allow Undergraduate Credits Towards a Graduate Degree) \nWhen considering the undergraduate category of prior coursework, the Graduate Faculty Executive Committee (GFEC) restricts the seven credits of undergraduate work to UW-Madison courses because of the challenges associated with assessing the rigor of courses taught at other institutions.\nAccredited programs may request an exception to this policy to allow up to seven credits of undergraduate coursework from other institutions to count toward a graduate degree based on specialized accreditation.  The process for requesting an exception was approved by the GFEC in 2014 and is as follows in italics:\nAn exception to allow up to seven credits from an undergraduate degree earned at a non UW- Madison institution to count toward a UW-Madison graduate degree can be requested on a program-by-program basis when the following two conditions are met:\n1) students have received their undergraduate degree in the same discipline as they are pursuing graduate work, and \n2) the undergraduate degree has been granted from a program which is accredited by the same accrediting body as the UW-Madison program.\nShould a program decide to request an exception to this policy, it must provide the Graduate School with information requested on the undergraduate credit exception form to be eligible for consideration. Please note submission of an exception request does not provide assurance of its approval.\nIf a program believes a student situation meets these criteria, it must request this exception by completing the steps as outlined in the undergraduate credit exception form.  A request may be made at any time, but please note that the earliest date for implementation is the term AFTER Graduate School approval.  Please direct any questions to Emily Reynolds at emily.reynolds@wisc.edu.\nTransfer from University Special Student Career at UW–Madison\nAfter admission to a graduate program, the student’s program may decide to accept up to fifteen University Special student credits as fulfillment of the minimum graduate residence, graduate degree, or minor credit requirements on occasion as an exception (on a case-by-case basis). In all these cases, the student would have to pay the difference in tuition for the terms in question. Those credits earned in a University Special student semester still appear in the transcript history as “University Special” student, but the Registrar’s Office will add a statement in the beginning of the transcript “All credits taken in [term] as a University Special student have been accepted by the Graduate School toward a degree program” after the student has paid the difference in tuition. UW–Madison coursework taken as a University Special student would not be allowed to count toward the 50% graduate coursework minimum unless taken at the 700 level or above. This work will not appear on the graduate career portion of the UW–Madison transcript nor count towards the graduate career GPA.\n\n\n\n\n**Prior Graduate Coursework from Other Institution(s)\n** Coursework from Undergraduate Career at UW–Madison (up to 7 credits total)\n**Transfer from University Special Student Career at UW–Madison (up to 15 credits total)\n\n\nMinimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement\nNo\nNo\n*Allowed up to 15 credits numbered 300 or above\n\n\nMinimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement\n*Allowed\n*Allowed up to 7 credits numbered 300 or above\n *Allowed up to 15 credits numbered 300 or above\n\n\nMinimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement\n*Allowed\n*Allowed up to 7 credits numbered 700 or above\n*Allowed up to 15 credits numbered 700 or above\n\n\n\n*Fulfillment of requirements is allowed in these instances only if approved by the student’s graduate program.\n**Coursework earned five or more years prior to admission to a master’s degree or coursework earned ten or more years prior to admission to a doctoral degree is not allowed to satisfy requirements.\nPrograms may decide to count previous graduate work from another institute toward fulfillment of degree credit requirements; however, this work will not appear on a UW–Madison transcript, and it does not count toward the Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence credit or graduate coursework (50%) requirements.\nPrior coursework can be used toward the minor requirement in accordance with the Prior Coursework policy chart.\nThe credits used towards a master’s degree and the prior coursework used toward it may also be applied to a related doctoral degree. However, if the prior coursework credit maximums were already reached for the master’s degree (seven UW–Madison undergraduate credits and/or fifteen University Special student credits), then no more prior coursework credits are permissible for the doctoral degree.\nStudents should be aware that some programs may require more rigorous credit requirements than the Graduate School’s minimum requirements. Students should contact their graduate program coordinator for further information.\nSee Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement\n\n\n\n\nProbation\n\nMore\n\n\n\nStudents must be in good academic standing with the Graduate School, their program, and their advisor. The Graduate School regularly reviews the record of any student who received grades of BC, C, D, F, or I in courses numbered 300 or above, or grades of U in research and thesis. This review could result in academic probation with a hold on future enrollment, and the student may be suspended from graduate studies.\nThe Graduate School requires that students maintain a minimum graduate GPA of 3.00 in courses taken as a graduate student (excluding research, audit, credit/no credit, and pass/fail courses). The Graduate School also considers Incomplete (I) grades to be unsatisfactory if they are not removed during the subsequent semester of enrollment; however, the instructor may impose an earlier deadline. The Graduate School may also put students on probation for incompletes not cleared within one term. All incomplete grades must be resolved before a degree is granted.\nIf students were admitted on probation and they satisfy the conditions outlined at the time of admission, probationary status will be removed automatically. Once their studies have begun, students are expected to make satisfactory progress toward their degree.\nSee Grade Point Average (GPA) Requirement, Holds, Incompletes, Satisfactory Progress, Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) Grades\n\n\n\n\nPrograms (or ‘Majors’)\n\nMore\n\n\n\nPrograms are officially approved courses of study and research leading to a master’s or doctoral degree. They may be administered from within a disciplinary department or across departments by an interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary cluster of faculty. Some programs have official areas of concentration within them (called Named Options or Subplans) at the master’s and/or doctoral levels. Both programs and named options appear on the student’s transcript. Some programs have unofficial tracks, specializations, or concentrations but these are not listed on the transcript. Contact the program’s graduate coordinator for more information.\nStudents who would like to pursue an individual program different from approved programs should see Special Graduate Committee Degrees.\nSee Applying to Add/Change Program, Plan, Certificate or Named Option, Change of Degree Level (Plan) or Degree Named Option (Sub-Major), Doctoral Minors, Special Graduate Committee Degrees\n\n\n\n\nProgress (P) Grades\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe P is an abbreviation for “Progress,” not an abbreviation for “Pass.” It is a temporary grade. Grades of P (except for research and thesis within the program) must be changed before a degree or preliminary exam warrant can be issued.\nIf a P is assigned for research courses numbered 790, 890, and 990, the grade will remain until the faculty member assigns a grade of S or U. All previously assigned P grades in that instructor’s research course will revert to an S or U upon assignment of the S or U grade. Usually this is upon assignment of the final grade for the course in the semester of submitting the dissertation. (All grades for 790, 890, 990 that are unreported by the end of the grading period will be automatically assigned a P.)\nSee Grading System, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, No Report (NR) Grades\n\n\n\n\nProject or Program Assistant (PA)\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThese titles designate graduate or professional students employed to assist with research, training, or other academic programs or projects. Contact the employing department directly for more information.\nThe Graduate Assistant Policies and Procedures (GAPP) outline employment-related practices for graduate student project assistants.\nSee Concurrent Appointments for Fellows/Trainees, Enrollment Requirements, Maximum Levels of Appointments, Tuition Remission, Payroll Benefits for Graduate Assistants, Fellows, and Trainees\n\n\n\n\nQualifying Examination\n\nMore\n\n\n\nQualifying examination requirements differ for each program. Students should contact their program to learn about specific requirements.\nSee Preliminary Examinations\n\n\n\n\nReadmission to Graduate School (for previously enrolled graduate students)\n\nMore\n\n\n\nIf graduate students do not continuously enroll during a fall or spring semester, they are required to apply for readmission to the Graduate School through the online application. The readmission process accomplishes two goals: (1) assures the Graduate School that graduate students are in good standing with their academic program; and (2) activates their enrollment eligibility. Further information about readmission for previously enrolled graduate students can be found here. To apply for readmission, graduate students must also contact their program for further details of the readmission process at the program level.\nA returning student who is completing another same level degree within five years must comply with double degree requirements, including the 25% overlap rule.\nAny student being readmitted to a graduate program must adhere to the requirements in the most current Academic Policies & Procedures and Graduate Guide.\nSee Double Degrees, Effective Dates, International Students Maintaining Legal Status, Leave of Absence, Time Limits\n\n\n\n\nRepeating Courses\n\nMore\n\n\n\nTypically, courses where content can change (such as special topics, seminars, independent studies, and research and thesis) can be repeated within the semester or on a semester basis. Repeated courses may earn course credit and satisfy the Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence, degree, and coursework (50%) credit requirements. Sometimes program authorization is necessary for enrollment.\nStudents are entitled to repeat any didactic course if they or their program feel it is necessary. Both grades will be used in calculating the student’s graduate grade-point average; however, the course will count only once toward the Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence, degree, and coursework (50%) credit requirements.\nSee Failure, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Satisfactory Progress, Appendix 4 – Grade-Point Average Calculation\n\n\n\n\nResearch Assistant (RA)\n\nMore\n\n\n\nA Research Assistant (RA) must be a graduate student working toward a master’s or doctoral degree. Research Assistants are UW–Madison graduate students who are given stipends to support their own education and training. RAs should not be given work assignments unrelated to their own educational pursuits – graduate assistants with significant duties unrelated to their own course of study should be appointed as a PA rather than an RA.\nThe program will give consideration for an RA appointment based on information provided in the application for admission or, in some cases, in a specific program application form. Research Assistants will receive a letter of appointment or reappointment each semester or year they hold their assistantship. If appointed students have not received such a letter, they should contact their payrolling office.\nNote that the RA appointment percentage is merely a mechanism for setting the stipend amount, and does not correlate to any particular requirement for hours of work. The maximum appointment percentage is 50%. However, to account for the potential that RAs may occasionally perform duties that are not directly related to their course of study, the university has deemed an RA appointment to entail 5 hours of compensated employment per week. In no event may an RA be asked to perform more than 5 hours per week of work unrelated to their course of study, regardless of percentage of RA appointment.\nThe Graduate Assistant Policies and Procedures (GAPP) outline employment-related practices for graduate student research assistants.\nSee Enrollment Requirements, Maximum Levels of Appointments\n\n\n\n\nResidence for Tuition Purposes\n\nMore\n\n\n\nWisconsin Statute 36.27(2) governs resident status for tuition purposes. To be eligible for in-state tuition, a student must be a bona fide resident of Wisconsin for at least the 12 months immediately prior to enrollment, or must qualify as a resident for tuition purposes under one of the provisions in the Statutes that waives the 12-month requirement. In determining resident status for tuition purposes, standards are different from those used for voting, paying taxes, etc.\nIf students are classified as nonresident for tuition purposes, they do not automatically become residents for tuition purposes after residing in Wisconsin for one or more years. In cases where it appears the students have entered and remained in Wisconsin principally for educational purposes, a presumption is made that they continue to reside outside the state. The presumption of non-residence continues in effect until rebutted by clear and convincing evidence of bona fide residence.\nProvisions of the statute under which a student may qualify as a resident for tuition purposes without waiting 12 months are:\n\nThe student is a graduate of a Wisconsin high school and has a parent who has been a bona fide resident of Wisconsin for the 12 months preceding the beginning of any term of enrollment or whose last surviving parent was a bona fide resident of this state for the 12 months preceding death;\nThe student, a spouse, or parent (of which they are claimed as a tax dependent), has moved to Wisconsin for a job transfer or for new employment that was accepted before moving and before the student applied to this university. The employment needs to continue full-time with the same employer, and the student needs to demonstrate an intent to establish and maintain their permanent home in Wisconsin;\nOne of the student’s parents is a bona fide resident of Wisconsin, and the student is a tax dependent of one of the parents.\n\nFind more information about residence for tuition purposes and the full text of the applicable statute on the Office of the Registrar’s Residence for Tuition Purposes webpage. Students with questions about residence for tuition purposes, or who believe they should be a resident and would like to appeal the nonresident tuition status, may contact the Office of the Registrar’s Residence Counselors.\n\n\n\n\nResponsible Conduct of Research\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe various areas of responsible conduct of research and associated policies are described below. For more information, see this comprehensive document regarding UW–Madison Research Safety and Compliance Training Requirements and the Research Policy and Compliance Checklist.\nAnimal Care and Use in Research\nUW–Madison has federal compliance responsibilities that pertain to the use of live, vertebrate animals in research, teaching, and outreach activities. This includes but is not limited to traditional basic and applied research models, instruction of students, and public events. Oversight and evaluation of the humane and ethical use of animals is performed by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUCs). The Research Animal Resource Center (RARC) provides support to the IACUCs and training to animal users necessary to provide the highest quality care and compliance for the university’s research animals. Learn more about the rules and regulations governing the care and use of research animals, how to prepare and submit animal care and use protocols to IACUCs, and how to obtain veterinary and pathology services at the Research Animal Resources Center webpage. Training and protocol approval are required before one can begin research projects involving animals.\nAuthorship\nAuthors of a research publication are usually those who provide meaningful intellectual contribution to a project in one or more of the following ways: concept, design, supervision, resources, materials, data collection and processing, analysis or interpretation, literature search and writing. Many academic journals may list very specific requirements for authorship. All authors have rights and responsibilities thus any person listed as an author should be knowledgeable and aware of such. Unless the contributions of the co-authors are listed, each author takes full responsibility for the contents of the work. When asked to serve as a publication reviewer, students should treat this material as confidential. See further information about authorship, publication and peer review.\nConflict of Interest\nThe Conflict of Interest (COI) staff and committee review reports of outside activities and financial interests to comply with federal, state, and university regulations and policies. This committee also works with faculty and staff to eliminate, minimize, or manage any actual or potential financial conflicts of interest identified by the reporting process. For further information see the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research’s Conflict of Interest guidance document and Outside Activities Reporting webpage.\nHuman Research Protections\nIn accordance with federal regulations and UW–Madison policies, all research involving human subjects must be reviewed and approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) prior to any research intervention with participants. All graduate research involving human subjects for inclusion in a master’s thesis or doctoral dissertation must be approved by an IRB before beginning the research. Training is required before a project is submitted to an IRB for review. For additional information, see the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research Human Research Protection Program webpage. For additional information visit the Institutional Review Board webpage.\nIntellectual Property Rights\nExcept as required by funding agreements or other university policies, the university does not claim ownership rights in the intellectual property generated during research by its faculty, staff, or students. This policy has proven beneficial to the university, the public, and the creators of such property. In the case of inventions funded in whole or in part by a federal agency or in the case of sponsored research agreements that require the university to grant rights in inventions generated by funding under such agreements, faculty, staff, and students must assign rights to such invention to the university’s designated patent management organization, the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF). Faculty, staff, and students must execute all papers necessary to file patent applications on the invention and establish the federal government’s or other sponsor’s rights in the invention. If there are no specific written agreements or policies to the contrary, the researcher at the university is free to dispose of the rights in the manner of his or her own choosing. The university retains the right to use the products of research conducted as a university activity for its education and research mission. See information and forms for disclosing an invention or read more about intellectual property.\nMisconduct of Research\nGraduate education is carried in classrooms, laboratories and other research venues, and is often supported by federal or other external funding sources. Maintaining the integrity of academic and research efforts carried out at UW–Madison is an essential priority. At UW–Madison, graduate students are held to the same standards of responsible conduct of research as faculty and staff. Misconduct in scholarly research is defined as fabrication (making up data), falsification (changing or misreporting data), plagiarism (representing work of others as your own), or other practices that seriously deviate from those that are commonly accepted within the scholarly community for proposing, conducting, or reporting research. For more information, see the overview of Misconduct in Scholarly Research and Faculty Legislation II-314: Misconduct in Scholarly Research. The Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research is responsible for investigating allegations of research misconduct. For more information, contact the Associate Vice Chancellor for Research Policy and Integrity.\nReporting Wrongdoing, Non-compliance or Research Misconduct\nThe University of Wisconsin-Madison strives to foster the highest scholarly and ethical standards among its students, faculty, and staff. As a recipient of federal funding, the University of Wisconsin must comply with federal laws related to civil rights, animal welfare research misconduct, and others. Though extremely rare, we realize there are times when reportable events of wrongdoing, noncompliance, or misconduct may occur in our midst and that it is our responsibility as an academic community to take steps to rectify them. See the Whistleblower Protection Policy and the policy on Obligations and Protections for Graduate Students.\nPatents\nA patent is an exclusive statutory right available to the inventor or inventors of new material. As inventors, students may have the right to seek patent protection for their invention (for example, for a product that results from the research documented in their dissertation).\nIf students have received support (for example, an appointment as a Research Assistant or Project Assistant) for the work leading to an invention, or used any other university funding, supplies, equipment, or university premises, in the work leading to an invention, they may have obligations that affect their rights to seek patent protection for an invention. It is important to discuss patents with their advisor. Also, students should review the Intellectual Property Policy for Research.\nResearch Regulatory Compliance\nIf students’ research involves human subjects (including data sets, surveys, human blood, or other body materials), live animals, recombinant DNA, infectious agents, stem cells, or biological toxins, they should consult the Research Ethics webpage.\nSafety\nBiological Safety\nThe Office of Biological Safety (OBS) assists faculty, students, and staff in observing safe practices in research in the biological sciences as prescribed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and endeavors to ensure that research is done in secure facilities in compliance with all local, state, and federal regulations. As an institution receiving NIH research funds, UW–Madison is subject to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules (rDNA). OBS provides the administrative mechanism by which research involving rDNA can be reviewed, thereby assuring compliance with the NIH guidelines. This institution adheres to the guidance of the CDC/NIH publication, Biosafety in Biomedical and Microbiological Laboratories. Institutional policies are described in the UW–Madison Researchers’ Biosafety Manual.\nChemical Safety\nThe UW–Madison Chemical Safety Office, working in conjunction with the campus Chemical Safety Committee, establishes policies and procedures for the safe acquisition, use, storage, and disposal of chemicals on campus. The Chemical Safety Office also advises campus chemical users on best practices and helps the university community comply with federal, state, and local chemical and environmental safety laws. See the Office of Chemical Safety website for additional information.\nRadiation Safety\nThe UW–Madison Office of Radiation Safety provides training on the safe use and handling of radioactive materials, which includes ordering, use, disposal, spill cleanup, and shipping for those employees who will need to ship radioactive materials. The Office of Radiation Safety also provides shielding assessments and dosimetry to those users who require it. Additionally, training on safe use of x-ray generating equipment and lasers is also available. See the Office of Radiation Safety website for additional information.\n\n\n\n\nSatisfactory Academic Progress\n\nMore\n\n\n\nContinuation in the Graduate School is at the discretion of a student’s program, the Graduate School, and a student’s faculty advisor.  A student may be placed on probation or dismissed from the Graduate School for not maintaining satisfactory academic progress.  In special cases the Graduate School permits students who do not meet these minimum standards to continue on probation upon recommendation and support of their advisor.\nThe Graduate School sets minimum standards that all graduate students in the university must meet. Many departments and programs have additional requirements that exceed these Graduate School minimum requirements. The definition of satisfactory progress varies by program.\nMost programs require satisfactory progress to continue guaranteed funding support.\nThe Graduate Guide includes the Graduate School’s minimum degree requirements and satisfactory progress chart, as well as each program’s minimum degree requirements and satisfactory progress chart.\nIn determining satisfactory academic progress, the Graduate School monitors the following: cumulative grade point average, incomplete grades, English as a second language for some international students, the grades of students admitted on probationary status, enrollment in minimum required credits (underload), and unsatisfactory (U) grades.  Detailed information for each is below.\nLow cumulative GPA\nGraduate students must meet the Graduate School’s minimum 3.0 cumulative GPA in order to graduate. Some probationary admission conditions may require higher grades. When a graduate student’s cumulative GPA drops below a 3.0 for one semester, we notify them via email (copy to grad coordinator) that they are placed on academic probation, and we place a GSD LGR enrollment hold on the following semester. They cannot continue enrolling until the probationary semester’s grades are reported and their cumulative GPA is above a 3.0.\nIf a student is placed on probation due to low GPA, they receive an email notification with the graduate coordinator copied.\nIncomplete (I) grades\nIf graduate students have not resolved incompletes by the end of the subsequent semester of enrollment, these grades are considered unsatisfactory. Graduate students are not permitted to graduate with incomplete grades on their record. The Graduate School issues warnings for incompletes that have not yet lapsed into bad standing, and for three or less credits of incompletes. The Graduate School places student on academic probation for having more than three credits of incompletes in bad standing and uses the GSD INC service indicator (enrollment hold) to ensure that this requirement is met before continued enrollment is permitted.\nIf a student is placed on probation due to incompletes, he/she receives an email notification with the graduate coordinator copied.\nESL required at admission to the Graduate School\nInternational graduate students may be required to take the ESLAT upon arrival at UW-Madison. This requirement applies to the following test scores: TOEFL (paper-based) test score is below 580; TOEFL computer based test (CBT) score below 237; (TOEFL internet based iBT) test score below 92; IELTS score below 7; or MELAB below 82. The ESLAT is administered by the English as a Second Language Program (Sandy Arfa, Director). ESLAT results may indicate that a graduate student is exempt from taking an ESL course, or these results may indicate a recommended ESL course. Graduate students for whom the ESLAT was required and who are not exempt based on the test results must enroll in the recommended ESL course during their first semester at UW-Madison. The Graduate School monitors successful completion of the ESL course for these students. The GSD ESL service indicator (enrollment hold) ensures that this requirement is met before continued enrollment is permitted.\nAdmit on probation\nApplicants who do not meet Graduate School admissions requirements may be admitted on probation, with program recommendation and GS Dean’s approval. They are admitted as G17 or G18 (probationary admit) codes, and receive an admission letter from the Graduate School, as well as message in OASIS, that notifies them they are being admitted on probation. These cases are monitored closely to ensure that the students achieve a 3.0 GPA during their first semester of enrollment. A hold is placed (GSD ADT), which prohibits them from enrolling in the following semester classes until their first semester grades are reported and the GPA is above a 3.0.\nUnderload (1 credit)\nGraduate students are required to enroll in a minimum of 2 graded, graduate-level credits each fall and spring semester. Those who are enrolled in only 1 credit each fall and spring semester are notified by the GS that they are under-enrolled. They are required to correct their enrollment immediately, and a GSD UNL hold is placed on their record, prohibiting them from enrolling in the subsequent term, until they meet the minimum enrollment requirement.\nUnsatisfactory (U) grades\nIf a course has been structured to offer the S/U grading option (such as research), a grade of S in that course would mean a grade of B or better. The Graduate School monitors U grades. Since these grades are very rare, cases are handled individually. Upon identification of a graduate student with a U grade in research, we contact the faculty advisor to find out more about the situation. GSD LGR holds are not automatically placed for U grades but may be if necessary.\n \n \nSee Grade Point Average (GPA) Requirement, Incompletes, Probation\n\n\n\n\nSatisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) Grades\n\nMore\n\n\n\nFor all courses listed as research, the only permissible grades are Satisfactory (S), Unsatisfactory (U), and Progress (P). Though an Incomplete (I) grade may be assigned, a final grade must be submitted during the following term. If a P grade is assigned, it will remain until the instructor assigns a grade of S or U; all previously assigned P grades should revert to an S or U upon assignment of the final grade in most cases. These courses will not count in the student’s graduate Grade Point Average (GPA).\nResearch courses are traditionally reserved for graduate students; however, other students (Law, Medical, Undergraduate, etc.) occasionally register for a research course. In these cases the student’s college can decide to have the course count in the GPA with an academic action to the Registrar’s Office.\nIf a course has been structured to offer the S/U grading option, a grade of S in that course would mean a grade of B or better. S/U courses are not computed into the grade-point average. They may however satisfy the Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence, degree, and coursework (50%) credit requirements as well as the minor course credit and in considering the minimum or maximum credit load per term. The S/U grading option is not to be confused with the pass/fail option. Unsatisfactory grades do not satisfy any Graduate School’s minimum credit requirements. Programs and the Graduate School monitor students for unsatisfactory grades. Advisor holds may be placed for students with unsatisfactory grades.\nThe use of letter grades (A through F) is encouraged and recommended whenever information on performance permits. Courses designated as research require grading on the S/U basis. In certain seminars and advanced topics courses, where lack of examinations and other performance criteria makes the A-F scale inappropriate, use of the S/U option is permissible.\nSee Grade Point Average (GPA) Requirement, Incompletes, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Pass/Fail, Probation, Progress (P) Grades\n\n\n\n\nSchedule of Classes\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe Schedule of Classes is available on the Course Search and Enroll App, and students can access the Schedule of Classes via their MyUW Student Center. The Schedule of Classes can be viewed using class search, the real-time online listing of course sections offered each term. Students are responsible for complying with enrollment deadlines, available at the Office of the Registrar’s Enrollment Deadlines.\nSee Authorization for Courses, Enrollment Accountability\n\n\n\n\nSchools and Colleges, Graduate Degrees\n\nMore\n\n\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin–Madison Schools and Colleges\nCollege of Agricultural and Life Sciences\nWisconsin School of Business\nSchool of Education\nCollege of Engineering\nGraduate School\nSchool of Human Ecology\nLaw School\nCollege of Letters and Science\nSchool of Medicine and Public Health\nSchool of Nursing\nNelson Institute for Environmental Studies\nSchool of Pharmacy\nSchool of Veterinary Medicine\nDegrees Granted by the University of Wisconsin–Madison Graduate School\nMaster of Accountancy (MAcc)\nMaster of Arts (MA)\nMaster of Business Administration (MBA)\nMaster of Engineering (MEng)\nMaster of Fine Arts (MFA)\nMaster of French Studies (MFS)\nMaster of International Public Affairs (MIPA)\nMaster of Music (MM)\nMaster of Public Affairs (MPA)\nMaster of Science (MS)\nMaster of Social Work (MSW)\nEducational Specialist in School Psychology (EdS)\nDoctor of Audiology (AuD)\nDoctor of Musical Arts (DMA)\nDoctor of Nursing Practice (DNP)\nDoctor of Occupational Therapy (OTD)\nDoctor of Philosophy (PhD)\nFor a list of programs and degrees offered by each department, see UW–Madison Graduate Academic Programs. Also see the current Graduate Guide.\nUW–Madison offers a number of post-baccalaureate professional degrees that are not administered by the Graduate School, but instead are solely supported by their home school. See Other Professional Degrees.\n\n\n\n\nSection Changes\n\nMore\n\n\n\nSection changes include: changes in Lectures, Discussions, Labs and Instructors’ course numbers for research or independent study courses for which students are already enrolled. Always consult the Office of the Registrar for deadlines and procedures for section changes.\nIf a student’s name does not appear on the appropriate instructor’s grade roster at the end of the term, a Course Change Request to change sections and a letter of request from the instructor of the class must be submitted to the Graduate School Office of Academic Services. The instructor of the correct section must submit a Grade Change Form to assign a grade. The instructor of the incorrect section should submit no grade.\nSee Course Changes, Grade Change\n\n\n\n\nSexual Harassment\n\nMore\n\n\n\nUW–Madison prohibits sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking. These offenses violate UW–Madison policies and are subject to disciplinary action. Sanctions can range from reprimand to expulsion from UW–Madison. In many cases, these offenses also violate Wisconsin criminal law and could lead to arrest and criminal prosecution.\nStudents who experience sexual harassment, sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and/or stalking have many options and services available to them on and off campus, including mental health counseling, victim advocacy and access to the criminal and campus disciplinary systems. For a list a confidential support and reporting options, please visit University Health Services.\nAll students are encouraged to report harassment of any kind, whether it is by a faculty or staff member or another student. Students may contact the Office of Student Assistance and Support: visit 70 Bascom Hall, email OSAS@studentaffairs.wisc.edu, call 608-263-5700 and ask to speak to the Dean on Call, or fill out a Bias Incident Reporting Form.\nFaculty, staff, teaching assistants, and others who work directly with students at UW–Madison are required by law to report first-hand knowledge or disclosures of sexual assault to university officials for statistical purposes. In addition, disclosures made to certain university employees, such as academic advisors or university administrators, may be forwarded to the campus Title IX coordinator for a response. For more information, visit the Office of Student Assistance and Support’s Sexual Assault, Dating and Domestic Violence webpage.\nGraduate students are expected to complete an online violence prevention program. Read more about the violence prevention program for graduate students.\nSee Grievances and Appeals\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Graduate Committee Degrees\n\nMore\n\n\n\nSpecial graduate committee degrees are one-of-a-kind degrees built around unique needs of individual students that cannot be satisfied by approved programs (e.g., by existing major program/minor combinations, joint degrees, distributed minors, etc.) and may permit individual degrees in new and emerging fields or combinations of disciplines. A higher degree of independence is required on the part of the student, since easily available guidance provided by programs is often more difficult to obtain, and there is not the usual collegial group of students in closely related research and coursework.\nThe master’s and doctoral special graduate committee guidelines are:\n\nProspective students who may have an interest in a special graduate committee degree should apply to the degree program that is closest to their program interest.\nUpon receipt of an application on which a prospective student has expressed interest in a special graduate committee degree, the program will follow all relevant program admission requirements.\nStudents may not be admitted directly to a special graduate committee degree program. They must be accepted for admission by an established department or program and be attending classes at UW–Madison before a proposal for a special graduate committee degree will be considered by the Graduate School.\nThe department or program admitting the student must be prepared to see the student through an established degree program. No commitments are made to provide a special graduate committee degree until after the student is enrolled and the proposal for the special degree and the student’s ability at the graduate level have been evaluated and approved.\nThe student’s advisor authors and submits the special graduate committee degree proposal on behalf of the student as early in the student’s program as possible. Proposals submitted after a substantial portion of the program has been completed will not be accepted. Doctoral proposals must be submitted by the end of the first year of graduate work. Master’s proposals must be submitted after the equivalent of the first full-time semester of graduate work. The proposal should consist of the following elements:\n\nThe reasons the special graduate committee program is needed and an explanation of why the student’s needs cannot be met within existing programs.\nThe exact title of the proposed degree program (which should be brief and descriptive).\nThe proposed course and seminar program of graduate work on this campus. Include the course title, program, course number, credits, grade, and semester taken/to be taken.\nAny specific requirements of the dissertation or thesis (language, equipment, etc.).\nThe nature and scope of preliminary examinations for the doctoral degree, or the examination procedure for the master’s degree.\nThe nature of the dissertation or thesis (general subject area).\nThe names of the faculty members who, in addition to the advisor, are willing to share the responsibility of supervising the student’s program. Including the advisor, the doctoral degree requires 4 members (including 3 UW–Madison graduate faculty members), and the master’s degree requires 3 members (including 2 UW–Madison graduate faculty members). Approval signatures of the committee members are required on the proposal.\n\n\nThe Graduate School will carefully review proposals to determine whether or not the program can be carried out within an established department or program, joint degrees, appropriate use of minors, or other available mechanisms. The suitability and degree of commitment of the committee for the proposed program will be examined.\nThe chairperson of the committee (usually the advisor) should be a member of the program to which the student originally had been admitted. That program should remain the keeper of the student’s records and should make all appropriate nominations for financial aid.\nThe Graduate School is concerned about maintaining active participation by all members of special degree committees in the ongoing program of the student and asks the individual members of the committee to assume program responsibilities provided institutionally in a conventional program. Faculty members who are willing to serve on these committees should be prepared to participate fully in all aspects of the student’s program from the beginning, especially where they must provide the necessary expertise in their particular areas of interest.\n\nSee Committees (Doctoral/Master’s)\n\n\n\n\nSpecialist Certificates (For students in ELPA or LIS programs)\n\nMore\n\n\n\nStudents can earn a Specialist Certificate in Educational Leadership and Policy Analysis or a Specialist Certificate in Library and Information Studies. The Specialist Certificate represents work beyond the master’s level. In addition to program requirements, the Graduate School requires that the student must meet all Graduate School minimum degree and satisfactory progress requirements as listed in the Graduate School’s Minimum Degree Requirements and Satisfactory Progress chart in the Graduate Guide.\nFor additional information, contact the programs that offer the Specialist Certificates.\nSee Enrollment Requirements, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Transfer Credits for Prior Coursework, Time Limits\n\n\n\n\nStudy Abroad\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe university creates an international context for education by providing opportunities for UW–Madison students to study overseas. Because of the variety of programs, students should coordinate their study abroad program with their graduate program, the Graduate School, and International Academic Programs (IAP).\nStudents intending to study abroad through a UW–Madison approved study abroad program can learn more about their options through International Academic Programs.\nGraduate students who are interested in conducting research abroad can register for IAP’s UW Graduate Research, which allows students to stay continuously registered as UW–Madison students, receive research credit with their faculty advisor, international health insurance, and 24/7 emergency assistance through IAP. This is an individualized experience and is not tied to a specific study abroad program. Students will need to have a high degree of independence in arranging housing and logistics for themselves.\nAll graduate students traveling abroad are encouraged to acquire insurance through Cultural Insurance Services International.\nSee Fellowships, Insurance and Medical Benefits\n\n\n\n\nTeaching Assistant (TA)\n\nMore\n\n\n\nMany programs offer Teaching Assistantships. This title is appropriate for graduate students who have been assigned teaching responsibilities in an instructional program under the supervision of a faculty member of the academic staff. Contact the employing program directly for more information about the TA position.\nThe Graduate Assistant Policies and Procedures (GAPP) outline employment-related practices for graduate student teaching assistants.\nSee Enrollment Requirements, Maximum Levels of Appointments, Teaching Assistant (TA) Orientation and Training, Tuition Remission, Payroll Benefits for Graduate Assistants, Fellows, and Trainees\n\n\n\n\nThesis (Masters)\n\nMore\n\n\n\nSome master’s degrees require a thesis to be deposited in the Memorial Library. The Graduate School produces materials that describe the preparation of a thesis. See the Graduate School’s guide to Completing Your Master’s Degree.\nSee Dissertation and Thesis Standards and Publishing\n\n\n\n\nTime Limits\n\nMore\n\n\n\nGraduate degrees are awarded, in part, for completion of current coursework. Students who break enrollment from their graduate program may risk losing all credits earned prior to their absence.\nMaster’s degree: students who have been absent for five or more consecutive years lose all credits that they have earned before their absence.\nDoctoral degree: students who have been absent for ten or more consecutive years lose all credits that they have earned before their absence.\nIndividual programs may count the coursework students completed prior to their absence for meeting program requirements; however that coursework will not count toward Graduate School credit requirements. Although the program may count the coursework students did before their absence towards the program requirements, the Graduate School does not count that work toward the Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence, degree, and coursework (50%) credit requirements.\nA candidate for a doctoral degree who fails to take the final oral examination and deposit the dissertation within 5 years after passing the preliminary examination may be required to take another preliminary examination and to be admitted to candidacy a second time.\nA student’s program may appeal these time limits through a written request to the Graduate School Degree Coordinator. The appeal must provide information demonstrating that the student has remained current in the field of study. This information may include a resume showing applicable work experience and/or official transcripts from other schools attended.\nSee Effective Dates, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Preliminary Examinations, Readmission to Graduate School (for previously enrolled graduate students)\n\n\n\n\nTransfer of Graduate Work from Other Institutions\n\nMore\n\n\n\nUnder the Prior Coursework policy, a student’s program may decide to accept graduate coursework completed outside of the students graduate career at UW–Madison when those courses are rigorous and meet the expectations of a graduate work for the degree. Students should contact their program when inquiring about or attempting to transfer graduate work from other institutions. Coursework earned five or more years prior to admission to a master’s degree or coursework earned ten or more years prior to admission to a doctoral degree is not allowed to satisfy Graduate School minimum credit requirements. See the Satisfying Requirements with Prior Graduate Coursework from Other Institution(s) section of the Prior Coursework policy.\nSee Dean’s Approval, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Prior Coursework\n\n\n\n\nTraveling Scholar Program\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe Big Ten Academic Alliance sponsors the Traveling Scholar Program as part of a continuing effort to increase cooperative use of its member institutions’ resources. This program enables doctoral-level students at any Big Ten Academic Alliance university to take advantage of educational opportunities (specialized courses, unique library collections, unusual laboratories) at any other Big Ten Academic Alliance university without additional tuition expenses. Find a list of member universities.\nCredits earned by Traveling Scholars are transferred by the home university upon receipt of transcript from the host university. Courses and grades are posted directly on a student’s UW–Madison transcript and, if graduate level, count toward the Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence, degree, and coursework credit requirements. Terms are limited to two semesters or three quarters regardless of the number of courses taken.\nStudents interested in the Traveling Scholars Program should contact the Graduate School Degree Coordinator for an application or more information.\nSee Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Transfer Credits for Prior Coursework\n\n\n\n\nTuition and Fee Information\n\nMore\n\n\n\nStudents go to their MyUW Student Center Tuition Account Summary to view their tuition charges, payments, financial aid, loans, scholarships and refunds; and to access links to set up an “Authorized Payer” and view, print, and pay eBills.\nThe tuition bill is provided as an eBill which is published to view, print, or pay online on the Tuition Account eBill/ePayment secure website. An email is sent to notify students and their Authorized Payers each time a new eBill is published. If students want their parents to have access to the website, students must first set them up as Authorized Payers. Detailed Authorized Payer information is available on the Bursar’s Office How to Add an Authorized Payer webpage.\nTuition and fee charges must be paid by the due date indicated on the tuition and fee statement to avoid a $100 late fee. (Late fee is subject to change.) UW–Madison does not accept debit or credit cards for tuition payment. Detailed payment options and information are available on the Bursar’s Office Payment Methods webpage. For tuition account questions or more information, contact the Bursar’s Office at: tuition@bussvc.wisc.edu (include the student name/ID in the email), or by phone: 608-262-3611.\nThe date a course is dropped or the date a student submits an online withdrawal request determines eligibility for a tuition adjustment. For tuition and fee adjustment and assessment questions, visit the Bursar’s Office Tuition Adjustment webpage or contact them at tuition@bussvc.wisc.edu. Find class drop deadlines, cost adjustments, tuition refund schedules plus other tuition and fees information on the Office of the Registrar’s Dates & Deadlines webpage.\nSee Tuition Remission, Withdrawal\n\n\n\n\nTuition Remission\n\nMore\n\n\n\nMost graduate students who have a Project Assistantship (PA), a Teaching Assistantship (TA), or a Research Assistantship (RA) of at least a 33% appointment for a fall or spring term are eligible to receive remission of full tuition.\nGraduate students enrolled in service-based pricing programs, such as online and accelerated programs, are ineligible to receive tuition remission. See a list of UW–Madison academic programs with service-based pricing (NetID login required).\nGraduate students should consult with their graduate programs and read their admission and appointment letters carefully to understand their benefits eligibility.\nFellowships that are payrolled through the university and carry stipends equivalent to at least a 33% Research Assistantship also qualify for remission of non-resident tuition.\nStudents should check with the payroll coordinator in their program to determine eligibility.\nAll graduate assistants are responsible for paying their segregated fees.\nTuition is remitted in summer sessions to graduate students in one of the following categories:\n\nThose continuing students who were granted remissions in the immediately-preceding Spring semester provided they held a teaching, research, or project assistantship (all tuition), or graduate fellowship (non-resident portion of tuition) and enroll in the summer session as graduate students;\nThose students who hold research, teaching, or project assistantship appointments, or fellowship appointments for the summer sessions, and who meet the criteria for remission established for the summer session.\n\nFor more information, visit the Bursar’s Office Tuition Remission webpage or view the Bursar’s Tuition Remissions Policy. For questions, contact the Bursar’s Office at remissions@bussvc.wisc.edu.\nSee Enrollment Requirements, Fellowships, Minnesota/Wisconsin Reciprocity, Project or Program Assistant (PA), Research Assistant (RA), Teaching Assistant (TA), Traineeships, Withdrawal, Payroll Benefits for Graduate Assistants, Fellows, and Trainees\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Special Student Status\n\nMore\n\n\n\nStudents enrolled as University Special students are considered non-degree candidates and pay tuition and fees at the designated special student rate. See the Transfer Credits for Prior Coursework policy for information on how limited credits taken as a University Special Student may be accepted by a graduate program. Students are not allowed to simultaneously enroll as a graduate student and as a University Special student.\nBefore beginning a graduate program, an international student may choose to study full-time English as a University Special student on an F-1 visa granted through the ESL program or on a J-1 visa with the sponsor’s approval. When the student begins a graduate program, the student’s status will be changed from University Special student to graduate student.\nFor more information visit the Adult Career and Special Student Services website or contact them at advising@dcs.wisc.edu.\n\n\n\n\nVariable Credit Courses\n\nMore\n\n\n\nSome didactic courses are offered to both undergraduate and graduate students. Typically undergraduate students enroll for a higher amount of total credits than do graduate students. Courses of this nature are designated in the Schedule of Classes as variable credit courses. Students should consult the Course Search and Enroll App to determine the appropriate credits when enrolling for a variable credit course.\n\n\n\n\nViolence Prevention\n\nMore\n\n\n\nUniversity Health Services (UHS) has designed an online sexual violence prevention training program specifically for graduate students to promote the health and safety of the campus community by increasing understanding of sexual assault, harassment, dating and domestic violence, and stalking, as well as prevention strategies, resources, victim rights, and reporting options. Starting fall 2017, all new incoming graduate students, admitted summer 2017 or after, are required to complete the 45-minute online training program within their first semester. Failure to complete the training will result in probation and a registration hold.\nFor further information, review the Task Force on Sexual Violence and Harassment recommendations document, which was adopted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents in 2016. For questions, visit the violence prevention program website or email violenceprevention@uhs.wisc.edu.\n\n\n\n\nWarrants\n\nMore\n\n\n\nA warrant is a program’s recommendation that a student be admitted to doctoral candidacy (a preliminary examination warrant) or be granted a degree (master’s or doctoral degree warrant).  Warrants are requested electronically by the Graduate Program Coordinator.  Once reviewed and approved by the Graduate School Degree Coordinator, the warrant serves as the Graduate School’s notification that a student has met both the Graduate School and program requirements with the exception for  degrees requiring a thesis/dissertation defense or final oral exam/exhibit. Approved warrants for doctoral degrees and master’s degrees requiring a thesis/dissertation defense or final oral exam/exhibit are made available to committee members for signature after evaluating the thesis/dissertation or final oral exam/exhibit.   If the committee decides the student has met this final requirement, the warrant is returned to the Graduate School for final review before the degree is approved (cleared) and awarded (posted).\nSee Certificate of Doctoral Candidacy, Dissertator Status, Dissertation Defense (Final Examination), Preliminary Examinations\n\n\n\n\nWithdrawal\n\nMore\n\n\n\nWithdrawal indicates that a student intends to stop attending classes for the current semester. Submission of a withdrawal request in MyUW Student Center is required between the first and last day of the semester, when a student wishes to drop all classes in which they are enrolled for the current semester. Requests are then routed electronically to the Graduate School for review. Approval from the Graduate School, as well as from the Office of International Student Services for students on J-1 and F-1 visas, is required before a graduate student is formally withdrawn from the semester. For more information visit the Office of the Registrar’s Withdraw or Cancel Enrollment for a Term webpage.\nIf students drop all courses before the first day of classes, they officially cancel their enrollment, owe no tuition or fees for that term, and have no semester entry on their transcript. In this case, it is not necessary for the student to submit a withdrawal request to the Graduate School. Students planning to withdraw from their academic program should contact their program directly.\nStudents are considered enrolled for a term if they have courses on their record on or after the first day of classes for that term regardless of whether they have paid tuition and fees. Failure to attend classes or leaving the university informally does not excuse a student from having to pay tuition and fees. If students withdraw after the transcript deadline, a notation with the date of withdrawal will appear on the transcript. Enrollment deadlines are posted by the Office of the Registrar on their Enrollment Deadlines webpage.\nFailure to withdraw properly and promptly can be expensive. Before withdrawing, students should consult the Office of the Registrar’s Enrollment Deadlines webpage for specific deadlines and refund dates. If a student received financial aid from the university, they should consult the Office of Student Financial Aid to determine repayment responsibilities. If students withdraw and are receiving remission of tuition, they are responsible for their entire tuition assessment.\nSee Tuition and Fee Information, Tuition Remission\n\n\n\n\n\nNo Results Found.\nAdd/Drop\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is a student’s responsibility to be aware of the add/drop deadlines each term.

An advisor—sometimes referred to as the major professor, mentor, or trainer—generally serves as chair of a student’s final examination committee.\nThe advisor/student relationship is one of mutual agreement, which may be terminated by either party. If a student changes advisors, they need to notify their program coordinator. It is the responsibility of every graduate student to have an advisor. If students do not have an advisor, the Graduate School may suspend them from further graduate study at UW–Madison until they find an advisor. However, in some cases, particularly for incoming students, the program may assign an advisor.\nWith approval from the program, students can have a co-advisor/co-chair. The co-advisor/co-chair may be from any of the following categories: graduate faculty, faculty from a department without a graduate program, academic staff (including emeritus faculty), visiting faculty, faculty from another institution, scientists, research associates, and other individuals deemed qualified by the program executive committee or its equivalent. Effective September 1, 2017, the co-advisor/co-chair will be designated on dissertation documentation.\nSee Committees (Doctoral/Master’s)\nAn advisor is a faculty member from the program responsible for providing advice regarding graduate studies and for supervising a student’s degree program (including research).

Effective September 1, 2017, the co-advisor/co-chair will be designated on dissertation documentation.\nSee Committees (Doctoral/Master’s)\nApplying to Add/Change Program, Plan, Certificate or Named Option\n\nMore\n\n\n\nCurrently enrolled graduate students who want to apply to add, change, or discontinue a program of study, or add a certificate, do so through the Graduate Student Portal (in the MyGradPortal in MyUW).  An admissions application and fee are not required.\nStudents must check with the intended program concerning admission requirements (for example, letters of recommendation or statement of purpose) and eligibility. Upon receipt of a recommendation from the program, the Graduate School will notify the student of the decision. Note: Changing programs between a service based pricing program and a pooled program during a term are not allowed, so students should always indicate the next academic term when requesting to change between these types of programs. Adding minors, certificates, or discontinuing a program is allowed during a term. Questions regarding the status of an application are best directed to the program.\nIf dissertators want to add a program, typically a master’s program or a certificate program, they cannot concurrently hold dissertator fee status while pursuing the graduate degree or certificate. Dissertators who add a program or a certificate program will be removed from dissertator status and must enroll and pay fees as a regular graduate student.\nInternational students who add/change a program or a certificate program should contact International Student Services to discuss the possible effects this change of program could have on immigration status.\nSteps to Add/Change Program, Plan, or Named Option\nAccess MyUW and the Graduate Student Portal:\n\nGo to my.wisc.edu.\nEnter your NetID login information.\nClick on the tile “Graduate Student Portal”. If you do not see the tile, you can search for it in the top search bar and add it to your page.\n\nInitiating a request:\n\nOnce in your Portal page, select the tile on the home page titled “Add/Change Programs.”\nIn the “Enrolled Programs” section, you will have options to add a Graduate/Professional certificate, doctoral minor (PhD students only), or major. You also have the option to discontinue a program in which you are already enrolled.\nChoose an action button, which will display an associated window and show fields appropriate for the type of request.\nFill out the fields and click the “send” button to complete the initial request.\n\nThe request will show up as “In Review” in the Requests section on the Add/Change Programs page. Your Graduate Program Coordinator will follow up once your request is decided. More detailed instructions on this process, including example screenshots, can be found in the Add/Change/Discontinue Program Training.\nSee Change of Degree Level (Plan), Change of Degree Named Option, Dissertator Status, Named Option, Programs (or ‘Majors’)\nAssistantships\n\nMore\n\n\n\nDepartments/programs determine eligibility for most Teaching Assistantships (TAs), Research Assistantships (RAs), and Project/Program Assistantships (PAs). Other possible university appointments include fellowships, traineeships, reader/grader, and student hourly positions. Students should contact their program for information on how to obtain an assistantship.\nMore information can be found in the Payroll Benefits appendix.\nThe Graduate Assistant Policies and Procedures (GAPP) outline employment-related practices for graduate student teaching, research, and project assistants.\nSee Enrollment Requirements, Fellowships, Maximum Levels of Appointments, Project or Program Assistant (PA), Research Assistant (RA), Teaching Assistant (TA), Traineeships\nAttendance\n\nMore\n\n\n\nStudents should not attend classes without being enrolled. Faculty and instructors may require enrolled students to attend scheduled meetings of a class and/or to participate in other course-related activities, including online learning. Students are responsible for materials presented in such meetings or activities. Because courses are designed and conducted in diverse ways, faculty and instructors should inform students in writing at the beginning of each course if there are specific expectations for attendance/participation, including whether any component of the grade is based on such attendance/participation.\nSee Religious and Election Day Observances Policy and Guidelines in the Academic Calendar for more information.\nAuditing Courses\n\nMore\n\n\n\nA student auditing a course is expected to attend classes on a regular basis as an observer. Audits are not free; a course taken for audit costs the same as a course taken for credit. If students are not paying full-time fees, they will be assessed per-credit fees for an audit course. Auditors do not take examinations or submit class work. Auditors will receive a final grade of either S (Satisfactory) or NR (No Report). Audit courses do not satisfy any credit, coursework, or degree requirements, nor do they count in fulfilling minimum or maximum credits required in each term. Students holding assistantships and fellowships should be particularly aware of the enrollment requirement for their appointment, as audit requests will be denied if auditing the course would drop them below the required number of graded credits.  If students audit a course and do not attend or drop it, they will receive a grade of NR (No Report). Dissertators are not allowed to audit.  Dissertators who wish to audit a course will be removed from dissertator fee status and assessed regular graduate student fees and also will need to enroll in the appropriate number of graded credits (see enrollment requirements). Students who have research assistantship, fellowship or traineeship appointments are required to be enrolled full-time; audited courses do not count toward full-time enrollment.\nInstructors may limit the number of auditors in a course and may restrict participation of auditors in courses inappropriate for that function. For example, courses that by their nature require participation (seminars, research, laboratory, performance, or language courses) are typically considered inappropriate for auditing.  Additionally, independent study courses are not appropriate for auditing.\nTo audit a course, a student must first obtain the consent of the instructor. The student must follow the procedures established in the program offering the course. Graduate School Dean’s approval is required for all course changes, including audit; see the Course Changes section of this document for instructions. The Dean’s signature will be fulfilled once submitted to the Graduate School. The deadline to request/cancel permission to audit is the drop deadline, which is the end of the 9th week of class during the fall and spring semester. Requests for late audits will not be considered. Specific deadline dates, including those for summer sessions, are posted prior to each semester by the Office of the Registrar.\nThe enrollment system counts all credits in determining maximum credit loads. A Credit Overload Request from is required if a student’s total credit load exceeds the maximum limit per term.\nSee Authorization for Courses, Course Changes, Credit Changes, Dean’s Approval, Dissertator Status, Enrollment Requirements, Overloads, Refunds\nAuthorization for Courses\n\nMore\n\n\n\nEnrollment authorization may be required for certain courses and/or situations, such as:\n\nauditing courses\npermission to take a course when a student does not meet course controls or prerequisites, or\npermission to enroll in a closed course\n\nOnce authorized by the program offering the course, students then may enroll in the course.\nSee Add/Drop, Auditing Courses, Credit Changes, Pass/Fail\nBenefits\n\nMore\n\n\n\nProject/Program Assistants (PAs), Research Assistants (RAs), and Teaching Assistants (TAs), fellows, and trainees who hold at least a 33% appointment (or an equivalent) may be eligible for health insurance, vacation, sick leave, and remission of tuition. Students should contact their department/program staff benefits coordinator for details.\nGraduate students enrolled in service-based pricing programs, such as online and accelerated programs, are ineligible to receive tuition remission. See a list of UW–Madison academic programs with service-based pricing (NetID login required).\nSee Enrollment Requirements, Insurance and Medical Benefits, Tuition Remission, Payroll Benefits\nBreadth Requirements in Doctoral Education\n\nMore\n\n\n\nBreadth is a required component of doctoral training at UW–Madison. Given there are multiple paths to breadth, the Graduate School leaves the choice of whether students achieve breadth through a minor or other means up to the specific program.\nSee Minors\nCanceling Enrollment\n\nMore\n\n\n\nBefore the first day of classes (Canceling Enrollment)\nIf students do not wish to attend a semester and drop all courses before the first day of classes, they officially cancel their enrollment, owe no tuition or fees for that term, and have no semester entry on their transcript. In this case, it is not necessary for the student to submit a withdrawal request through MyUW.\nOn or after the first day of classes (Withdrawing)\nOn or after the first day of class, students who no longer wish to remain enrolled need to submit an electronic withdrawal request via MyUW Student Center. More information about canceling enrollment or withdrawal requests can be found on the Registrar’s website.\nSee Withdrawal\nCapstone Certificates\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe university offers capstone certificates for students not currently enrolled in a UW–Madison graduate degree program. Applicants must have completed a baccalaureate degree or equivalent credential from an accredited college or university. The capstone certificate is designed to ‘cap off’ undergraduate experience or to offer a focused professionally oriented experience. Capstone programs do not lead to the conferral of a graduate degree. Further information about capstone certificates can be found on the Professional Degrees & Certificates website.\nSee Graduate/Professional Certificates, Specialist Certificates\nCertificate of Doctoral Candidacy\n\nMore\n\n\n\nDissertators who do not plan on finishing their degree may request a Certificate of Doctoral Candidacy in recognition of their completion of all requirements toward the doctoral degree except for the dissertation (sometimes called all but dissertation/ABD at other institutions). The certificate shows the date of the preliminary examination as well as the issue date, but does not substitute for an official transcript from the Office of the Registrar. To obtain the certificate, students, advisors, or graduate coordinators should contact the Graduate School Degree Coordinator.\nSee Dissertator Status\nCertification of Enrollment Status\n\nMore\n\n\n\nFor purposes of certification to government or private agencies, the Office of the Registrar determines enrollment status as full-time or part-time according to institutional policies, which may differ from full-time or part-time requirements imposed by individual schools or programs. Certification of official enrollment for loan deferment, medical and auto insurance forms, and credit card applications can be obtained by going to the Office of the Registrar’s verifications webpage.\nVeterans Certification: Student Veterans who are eligible for Federal and State Educational Benefits should apply for certification of enrollment at University Veteran Services. Students receiving veterans’ benefits are required to promptly report any credit change or withdrawal from school to University Veteran Services.\nSee Enrollment Requirements\nCertification of Graduation (or ‘Degree Completion Letter’)\n\nMore\n\n\n\nIf you have completed all degree requirements and deposited your thesis or dissertation and are waiting until the next degree conferral date to receive your degree, you may request from the Office of the Registrar a Degree Completion Letter (Degree Verification) indicating that all requirements have been completed. Important: All grades from the semester in which you are depositing your dissertation (and all other outstanding grades) must be reported before you can receive a completion letter.\nSince master’s and doctoral degrees do not appear on transcripts until 4 to 6 weeks after the end of a semester, students may wish to obtain this letter from the Registrar’s Office to provide to employers or other universities to verify degree completion before the transcript posting, but after all grades are finalized and their dissertation (doctoral degree) or thesis (if required for the master’s degree) is approved and deposited.\nSee Degree Conferral/Payroll End Dates, Holds\nChange of Degree Level (Plan) or Degree Named Option (Sub-Major)\n\nMore\n\n\n\nDegree Level (Plan)\nA student may change their degree level, for example, if students with a master’s degree plan have completed their master’s degree and want to continue in the same program for the doctoral degree. To change degree level, see Applying to Add/Change Program, Plan, or Named Option.\nNamed Option (Sub-Major)\nA named option is a formally documented sub-major within an academic major program. Named options appear on the transcript with degree conferral. The Graduate Faculty Executive Committee approves official named options. Many programs may also have unofficial specializations, concentrations, or tracks; unlike named options these do not appear on the transcript. Find more information on named options. To report a change in degree named option, see Applying to Add/Change Program, Plan, or Named Option.\nFor questions, please contact the Graduate School Degree Coordinator.\nSee Applying to Add/Change Program, Plan, or Named Option, Programs (or ‘Majors’)\nCommittees (Doctoral/Master’s/MFA)\n\nMore\n\n\n\nCommittees advise and evaluate satisfactory progress, administer preliminary and final oral examinations, evaluate a thesis or dissertation, and/or sign a degree warrant. A student’s program arranges a committee with appropriate expertise to afford the breadth and depth needed in degree examinations. The responsibilities of individual committee members are determined by the program. The executive committee (or its equivalent) of a program/department is responsible for approving the composition of all graduate committees. The final warrant request which includes committee membership must be submitted to the Graduate School at least three weeks before the examination date. Students should consult their advisor and their program’s student handbook for the specific function of degree committees in their program.\nUse this online tool to help you determine whether the proposed committee would meet the following criteria.\nTHE GRADUATE SCHOOL REQUIREMENTS FOR GRADUATE COMMITTEES ARE AS FOLLOWS:\nFor doctoral committees/final oral examination committees:\n1. The chair or one of the co-chairs of the committee must be graduate faculty1 from the student’s program.  (Note:  Faculty who retire or resign retain graduate faculty status for one year and can serve as chair or a co-chair during that time.)4,5\n2. The committee must have at least four members. The committee must have members from at least two University of Wisconsin—Madison graduate programs.3,5    \n3. Three of the committee members must be UW–Madison graduate faculty or former UW–Madison graduate faculty up to one year after resignation or retirement.\n4. At least three committee members must be designated as readers.6\n5. The fourth member and any additional members may be from any of the following categories, as approved by the program executive committee (or its equivalent): graduate faculty, faculty from a department without a graduate program1, academic staff2 (including emeritus faculty), visiting faculty, faculty from other institutions, scientists, research associates, and other individuals deemed qualified by the executive committee (or its equivalent).\n6. All committee members have voting rights. To receive a doctoral degree, students cannot receive more than one dissenting vote from their committee on the final degree warrant.\nFor MFA final committees:\n1. The chair or one of the co-chairs of the committee must be graduate faculty1 from the student’s program.  (Note:  Faculty who retire or resign retain graduate faculty status for one year and can serve as chair or a co-chair during that time.)4,5\n2. The committee must have at least four members.\n3. Three of the committee members must be UW–Madison graduate faculty or former UW–Madison graduate faculty up to one year after resignation or retirement.\n4. The fourth member and any additional members may be from any of the following categories, as approved by the program executive committee (or its equivalent): graduate faculty, faculty from a department without a graduate program1, academic staff2 (including emeritus faculty), visiting faculty, faculty from other institutions, scientists, research associates, and other individuals deemed qualified by the executive committee (or its equivalent).\n5. All committee members have voting rights. To receive a MFA degree, students cannot receive more than one dissenting vote from their committee on the final degree warrant.\nFor master’s thesis committees:\n1. The chair or one of the co-chairs of the committee must be graduate faculty1 from the student’s program.  (Note:  Faculty who retire or resign retain graduate faculty status for one year and can serve as chair or a co-chair during that time.)3,5\n2. The committee must have at least three members.\n3. Two of the committee members must be UW–Madison graduate faculty or former UW–Madison graduate faculty up to one year after resignation or retirement.\n4. The third member and any additional members may be from any of the following categories, as approved by the program executive committee (or its equivalent): graduate faculty, faculty from a department without a graduate program1, academic staff2 (including emeritus faculty), visiting faculty, faculty from other institutions, scientists, research associates, and other individuals deemed qualified by the executive committee (or its equivalent).\n5. All committee members have voting rights. To receive a master’s degree, students cannot receive more than one dissenting vote from their committee on the final degree warrant.\nFor master’s non-thesis committees:\n1. The committees must have at least one graduate faculty1 from the student’s program.3,5\n2. To receive a master’s degree, students cannot receive more than one dissenting vote from their committee on the final degree warrant.\nFootnotes:\n1 Graduate Faculty: The UW–Madison Faculty Policies and Procedures 3.05 contains the policies and exceptions regarding the graduate faculty status.\n2 Academic Staff: The UW–Madison Faculty Policies and Procedures 3.05H contains the policy related to academic staff serving on the committees.\n3 Program: Programs are officially approved courses of study and research leading to a master’s or doctoral degree. They may be administered from within a disciplinary department or across departments by an interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary cluster of faculty. Some programs have official areas of concentration within them (called named options or subplans) at the master’s and/or doctoral levels. Both programs and named options appear on the student’s transcript. Some programs have unofficial tracks, specializations, or concentrations, but these are not listed on the transcript. Contact the program’s graduate coordinator for more information.\n4 The advisor does not have to be chair of the committee, although it is often the case. Moreover, the co-advisors/co-chairs will be designated in the dissertation document.\n5 Note that affiliate appointments may be used to satisfy this requirement.\n6 Readers: Committee members who commit themselves to closely reading and reviewing the entire dissertation. The rationale for specifically designating non-reader status is to facilitate faculty participation in dissertations without automatically expecting the level of commitment associated with deeply engaging a PhD thesis. Given faculty workloads, designating a non-reader in some cases may permit faculty participation where engagement would otherwise be impossible. As long as the Graduate School minimum of at least three committee members that are readers is upheld, programs will remain in compliance with Graduate School policy. Programs may choose to have stricter requirements.\nSee Advisor\nCompassionate Tuition Adjustment\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe Graduate School supports the principles of a compassionate tuition adjustment to accommodate students who withdraw in the following circumstance:\n\nThe students have experienced an unexpected life circumstance and/or traumatic event for which they have little or no control, and\nIt appears that the event will impede/prevent the students from successfully completing the semester.\n\nThe dean or the dean’s designee will assess the meaning and effect of the event on the student and the request for tuition adjustment. Students requesting a tuition adjustment should submit their request in writing to Academic Services in the Graduate School, along with written support for the request from the student’s faculty advisor and/or graduate program chair. Relevant documentation may be required.\nSee Dean’s Approval\nConcurrent Appointments for Fellows/Trainees\n\nMore\n\n\n\nConcurrent appointments describes a situation where a graduate student holds multiple appointments as a fellow, trainee, and/or graduate assistant. Federal agencies and non-federal donors often place restrictions on the amount of work in which an awardee may engage, or on additional stipends an awardee may receive. In addition, the university has a concurrent appointment policy that places limits on multiple appointments for fellows or trainees.\nWhenever assistantships (RA, TA, or PA) are combined with fellowships or traineeships, total compensation cannot exceed the department’s full-time RA rate that was reported to the Graduate School for the current year (fellowship/traineeship + assistantship = total compensation). The list of approved program rates can be found on the Graduate Assistantships webpage, under “Assistantship stipends by program”.\nThe concurrent appointment policy for fellows/trainees can be found here in the University of Wisconsin-Madison Policy for Supplementation and Concurrent Appointments for Graduate Students Holding Predoctoral Fellowships or Traineeships.\nSee Maximum Levels of Appointments\nContinuous Enrollment Requirement for Dissertators\n\nMore\n\n\n\nOnce students achieve dissertator status they must maintain continuous enrollment until completion of the doctoral degree. In order to maintain continuous enrollment, dissertators must enroll each fall and spring semester for 3 credits (300 or above) directly related to their dissertation research (generally research and thesis and/or required seminars). In some cases, the 3 credits can be a combination of research and a seminar. Fall and spring enrollment are required whether or not they reside in Madison.\nAudits and pass/fail do not satisfy this requirement. Additional courses taken audit or pass/fail will result in removal of dissertator fee status.\nStudents are exempt from the requirement to enroll for the summer term, unless they are defending and/or depositing their dissertation or have a Research Assistantship (RA), fellowship, or traineeship that requires summer enrollment, or are using university facilities (including faculty and staff time).\nIf dissertators do not maintain continuous enrollment, they will be assessed a degree completion fee equal to 12 times the current per-credit rate in effect at the time that they submit their dissertation to the Graduate School for final review.\nSee Degree Completion Fee, Dissertator Status, Enrollment Requirements, Readmission to Graduate School (for previously enrolled graduate students)\nCourse Changes\n\nMore\n\n\n\nPrior to making changes to courses, be sure to review the Office of the Registrar’s Enrollment Deadlines Page for important dates and deadlines, and the Graduate School’s Enrollment Requirements including important information about minimum credits required.\nPrior to deadlines, students may make course changes online via MyUW Student Center. See the Late Enrollment/Late Course Change/Late Drop document for changing enrollment after the deadlines.\nIf a course change is made after the fee refund deadlines (including audited, modular, and zero-credit courses) students may owe additional money, even if the total number of credits for which they are enrolled does not change. The Bursar’s Office will notify students if they owe additional fees or are entitled to a refund.\nStudents holding graduate assistantships, fellowships, and traineeships must meet minimum enrollment requirements when making course changes.\nInternational students considering a course change that may drop them to part-time status must first receive authorization from International Student Services (ISS). This will ensure that they remain in compliance with Department of Homeland Security (DHS) visa regulations. International students holding graduate assistantships, fellowships, and traineeships must meet minimum enrollment requirements as well.\nFor more information and questions, contact the Office of the Registrar or Graduate School Academic Services. The Registrar’s Office also offers demos and tutorials for course enrollment. For instructions on how to late add/change/drop a class, visit the Late Enrollment/Late Course Change/Late Drop document.\nSee Add/Drop, Auditing Courses, Authorization for Courses, Credit Changes, Enrollment Requirements, Late Enrollment/Late Course Change/Late Drop, Section Changes, Tuition and Fee Information\nCourse Numbering System\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe number assigned to a course gives an indication of for whom the course is intended. While graduate students can enroll in courses numbered under 300, those courses do not count for any credits toward a graduate degree or for minimum enrollment requirements.\nThe Minimum Graduate Coursework Policy requires at least 50% of a graduate degree coursework be taken with courses that have the graduate level course attribute. See the Course Attributes Policy for specific information on courses that meet this requirement.\nSee also Continuous Enrollment Requirement, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Prior Coursework\nCredit Changes\n\nMore\n\n\n\nStudents are not allowed to enroll for more or fewer credits than indicated for a course in the Schedule of Classes.\nFor more information and questions, contact the Office of the Registrar or Graduate School Office of Academic Services. Demos & Tutorials for course changes are available here. For instructions on how to late add/change/drop a class, visit the Late Enrollment/Late Course Change/Late Drop section.\nSee Auditing Courses, Course Changes, Dean’s Approval, Late Enrollment/Late Course Change/Late Drop, Pass/Fail, Variable Credit Courses, Tuition and Fee Information\nCredit/No Credit Grades\n\nMore\n\n\n\nCourses that have been designated in the Schedule of Classes as credit/no credit are entered on transcripts as either CR, if students earned credits for which the course was offered, or N, if students did not earn any credit, even though they were enrolled for the course. Any course numbered 300 or above that is taken for credit/no credit will count toward the Graduate School’s minimum graduate degree credit requirement and the minimum graduate residence credit requirement (including 300-level courses in English as a Second Language). Visit the Office of the Registrar’s Valid Grades webpage for more information.\nDeadlines\n\nMore\n\n\n\nStudents are responsible for learning about and complying with campus deadlines. Failure to meet deadlines for enrollment, payment of fees, changing courses or credits, and receiving a degree can cost time, money, or both. The Office of the Registrar’s Enrollment Deadlines page lists enrollment, fee payment, and course change deadlines. Visit the Graduate School’s Degree Deadlines page for more information about the deadlines for achieving dissertator status or receiving a degree in any given semester.\nGraduate students should note that Graduate School deadlines do not necessarily correspond to undergraduate enrollment deadlines. Refer to the Office of the Registrar’s Enrollment Deadlines for detailed and specific enrollment and refund deadlines and dates.\nSee Add/Drop, Course Changes, Pass/Fail, Withdrawal\nDean’s Approval\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe Graduate School acts as the academic dean’s office for all graduate students. If a student needs a dean’s approval or authorization, they should contact the Graduate School Office of Academic Services at gsacserv@grad.wisc.edu.\nDegree Completion Fee\n\nMore\n\n\n\nFor master’s students\nIn lieu of enrollment, the Graduate School may approve payment of a degree completion fee for a master’s degree candidate who has completed all of the degree requirements except thesis defense, comprehensive examination(s), presentation of a final project, or removal of an incomplete grade. To be eligible students must have submitted their final thesis or project paper to their advisor while they were enrolled. This fee is comparable to 2 graduate credits at the current resident tuition rate. This fee is established annually and assessed per semester. Students should ask their program to submit a Degree Completion Fee Request Form to the Graduate School on their behalf before the beginning of the semester when students are completing a master’s degree. After the Graduate School approves the request, the fee will be added to the student’s account. Students must pay the completion fee before the program requests a warrant.\nFor dissertators\nThe Graduate School requires all dissertators to maintain continuous enrollment (see the continuous enrollment policy for dissertators). Dissertators must enroll in the semester(s) in which they defend, submit their dissertations, and graduate (see enrollment requirements for dissertators). In rare circumstances where this is not possible, a degree completion fee is assessed to recognize the inevitable use of university facilities (including faculty and staff time) up to and including the successful defense and submission of the dissertation. The fee is equal to 12 times the current per-credit dissertator rate in effect at the time the dissertation is submitted. The fee is assessed at the time dissertators are ready to complete the degree and is based on the resident or nonresident tuition status dissertators had at their last term of enrollment. If dissertators break enrollment and then reenter and enroll for less than 4 continuous terms before completion, they will pay a prorated rate (the 12-credit fee minus all continuous enrollment credits paid since the time of readmission). If enrollment is broken, but a dissertator reenters and enrolls for at least 4 continuous terms, then a completion fee is not assessed. Students must pay the completion fee before the program requests a warrant\nSee Continuous Enrollment Requirement for Dissertators, Enrollment Requirements\nDegree Conferral/Payroll End Dates\n\nMore\n\n\n\nGraduate students who complete all degree requirements at any point during a term remain officially enrolled and retain student status through the official degree conferral date for that term, as determined by the Secretary of the Faculty and posted as conferral date on the transcript. Degrees are granted three times per year in May, August, and December. The official conferral date can be found on the Office of the Registrar’s Dates & Deadlines webpage.\nFunding for graduating students\nGraduate assistants, fellows, and trainees may remain on the payroll until the end of the term, as stated above, or may be removed if necessary for a change of status (e.g. to a postdoc or academic staff position) or end of grant funding. If a student is removed, the Bursar’s Office will check with the Graduate School to confirm graduation at the end of the given term and will maintain tuition remission for appropriately funded students if the student remains on payroll through the dates listed below:\n\nDoctoral candidates: through the date of dissertation deposit or through the official conferral date of term\nNon-thesis master’s candidates: through the completion date stated on warrant or through the official conferral date of term\nThesis master’s candidates: through the date thesis is received by the Memorial Library or through the official conferral date of term\n\nInternational students: contact International Student Services for guidance on the degree completion date and its impact on the visa status. The dates listed above may be different for international students.\nWindow Period degrees\nThe “Window Period” is the time between the end of one degree period and the beginning of the next. Students are eligible to complete their degree requirements during the window period if they were registered for the previous semester (fall, spring, or summer). If all degree requirements are met by the end of the window period, a student’s degree will be granted for the following semester. Students will not have to register or pay fees for the next semester.\nStudents receiving window period degrees may remain on payroll and retain student status only through the dates listed below:\n\nDoctoral candidates: through the date of dissertation deposit or through the last day of the window period\nNon-thesis master’s candidates: through the completion date stated on warrant\nThesis master’s candidates: through the date thesis is received by the Memorial Library\n\nInternational students: contact International Student Services for guidance on the degree completion date and its impact on the visa status. The dates listed above may be different for international students.\nSee Certification of Graduation (or ‘Degree Completion Letter’), Graduation\nDegree Summary\n\nMore\n\n\n\nA computerized graduate degree summary is not prepared for graduate students (e.g. the Degree Audit Reporting System, or DARS). Students’ programs, particularly their advisors, are responsible for ensuring timely fulfillment of Graduate School and program requirements. Students should consult their program’s satisfactory progress criteria in their program’s student handbook, or in the Graduate Guide.\nStudents and programs can check academic progress using the Graduate Student Tracking System.\nSee Advisor, Satisfactory Progress\nDisability Accommodations\n\nMore\n\n\n\nStudents with disabilities are encouraged to inform their faculty advisor and instructor of their need for disability-related accommodations in a timely manner. Implementation of reasonable accommodations is a shared faculty and student responsibility. Faculty, either directly or in coordination with the McBurney Disability Resource Center, are expected to work with students to identify and provide reasonable accommodations.\nThe McBurney Disability Resource Center provides disability-related services and accommodations to undergraduate, graduate, professional, special and guest students. The Center works closely with students and faculty on the provision of reasonable accommodations to ensure access to the learning environment. The Center makes referrals to other campus offices or community resources for non-classroom accommodations such as housing, transportation, personal care attendants, etc. Students should contact the Center upon admission to begin the eligibility for services process. Early notice is essential in order to have services and accommodations in place prior to the start of the semester.\nMcBurney Disability Resource Center\n702 West Johnson Street, Suite 2104\n608/263-2741 (voice)\n608/225-7956 (text)\nmcburney@studentlife.wisc.edu\nSee Discrimination\nDiscrimination\n\nMore\n\n\n\nIn conformance with applicable federal and state law and with university policy, UW–Madison does not discriminate on the basis of age, ancestry, color, creed, disability, ethnicity, marital or parental status, national origin, pregnancy, race, religion, disability, retaliation for making a complaint of discrimination or taking part in an investigation relating to discrimination, sex, sexual orientation, or veteran’s status with regard to treatment of students in the educational programs or activities that the university operates.\nShould students wish to speak to someone about discrimination or harassment protected by federal or state laws or campus policies, they should contact the Office of Compliance or the Office of Student Assistance and Support.\nDissertation Standards and Publishing\n\nMore\n\n\n\nA doctoral dissertation must be a dissertator’s own work. If it is the result of research enterprises in which others have collaborated, a substantial portion must represent the dissertator’s own contribution and the other research participants must be identified.\nEffective September 1, 2017, dissertations must acknowledge contributions received from other individuals, including co-authors of published work that appears in the document, such as in designing the research, executing the research, analyzing the data, interpreting the data/research, or writing, proofing, or copyediting the manuscript.\nPublication of the doctoral dissertation is required. The university uses ProQuest UMI ETD Administrator to publish the dissertation electronically and on microfilm and to publish an abstract of the dissertation in Dissertation Abstracts, a monthly publication. Dissertators must pay the cost of processing the dissertation and publishing the abstract by ProQuest.\nAll doctoral dissertations are reviewed by the Graduate School’s Office of Academic Services. More information can be found on the Graduate School’s Completing Your Degree webpage.\nMost master’s theses at UW–Madison are not published through ProQuest, although a student may choose to do so. If students want to publish their master’s thesis through ProQuest, they should contact the Graduate School’s Office of Academic Services.\nSee Copyright, Deadlines\nDissertator Status\n\nMore\n\n\n\nDissertator is a unique fee status for students who have completed all requirements for a doctoral degree except for the dissertation. To be eligible for dissertator fee status, a student must:\n\nPass the preliminary examination(s);\nSatisfy the doctoral minimum graduate residence credit requirement;\nComplete all minor requirements, if the major program requires a minor;\nComplete all program requirements except the dissertation;\nClear all Incomplete grades or Progress grades in non-research courses (progress grades in 990 research may remain);\nEarn at least a 3.0 cumulative graduate GPA;\nReturn the signed and dated preliminary exam warrant to the Graduate School.\n\nDissertator status is effective at the start of the semester following completion of all dissertator requirements for the doctoral degree except for the dissertation. In order to initiate the change to dissertator status, the prelim warrant must be sent to the Graduate School in a timely fashion. Students can check on dissertator status by contacting their graduate program coordinator. All dissertator requirements must be met before the first day of classes to be a dissertator for any given semester. If all dissertator requirements are completed before the first day of classes but the signed prelim warrant does not reach the Graduate School by that deadline, the student can still become a dissertator that semester. Submit the warrant to the Graduate School as soon as possible and enroll for at least 3 credits (usually 990 research) for that semester. Removal of Dissertator Status: A dissertator who enrolls for more (or fewer) than 3 credits will be removed from dissertator status for the fall or spring term in which the enrollment is not exactly 3 credits. During the summer, however, an enrolled dissertator may ask their advisor to request an overload of 1-2 additional credits in a short session and still retain dissertator fee status, if the course is related to dissertation research or professional training that is not offered in regular semesters. The removal of dissertator status may have the following consequences:\n\nGraduate assistant (TA/PA/RA) stipend rates may have to be adjusted to the non-dissertator rate, or percent limitations\nFees are assessed at the non-dissertator rate\nFull-time status may change to part-time, possibly affecting loan deferral, visa status, etc.\n\nIf a dissertator wants to pursue a graduate degree or certificate in another area, the dissertator fee status will be discontinued and regular graduate fees will be assessed, with possible consequences listed above. Find more information about the tuition and fees for a dissertator and non-dissertator on the Bursar’s Office Tuition and Fees webpage.\nSee Addition/Change of Program, Plan, or Named Option, Enrollment Requirements, Maximum Levels of Appointments, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement\nDoctoral Minors\n\nMore\n\n\n\nBreadth is a required component of doctoral training at UW–Madison. Given there are multiple paths to breadth, the Graduate School leaves the choice of whether students achieve breadth through a doctoral minor (two options as described below), Graduate/Professional certificate, or other means up to the specific graduate program.  The specific Breadth Requirement Policy, including information on certificates, is found here: https://policy.wisc.edu/library/UW-1200\nMinor options are as follows:\nOption A (external doctoral minor): Requires a minimum of 9 credits in a doctoral minor program (single disciplinary or multi-disciplinary). Fulfillment of this option requires the approval of the doctoral minor program.\nOption B (distributed doctoral minor): Requires a minimum of 9 credits in one or more programs forming a coherent topic.  Fulfillment of this option requires the approval of the doctoral major program.\nThe Graduate School’s minimum course requirements for the doctoral minor include:\n\nAn average GPA of 3.00 on all minor coursework;\nCoursework must be graded courses numbered 300 or above; no audits or pass/fail;\nMaximum 3 credits of independent study (e.g., 699, 799, 899, 999);\nResearch and thesis cannot be used to satisfy the minor (e.g., 790, 890, 990);\nNo more than 5 credits of coursework completed more than 5 years prior to admission to the doctoral program; coursework taken 10 years ago or more may not be used.\n\nA student cannot earn a doctoral minor and a Graduate/Professional certificate of the same name. Credits earned towards the doctoral minor may count towards the minimum graduate residence requirement, minimum graduate degree requirement, and the minimum graduate coursework (50%) requirement.\nSee Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Prior Coursework\nDouble Degrees\n\nMore\n\n\n\nDouble degrees are two same-level (master’s or doctoral) degrees from two separate graduate programs. Students completing a double degree earn two degrees (two programs), and receive two diplomas. Double degree candidates have two advisors and two separate committees, and they complete two theses (master’s) or dissertations (doctoral).\nStudents may apply for an additional program at the time of original application, add a program at any time during their enrollment, or reapply and pursue a second degree after completion of the first.  Students should inquire with each program prior to enrollment to see if additional policies exist that would restrict the ability to complete a double degree.\nIn all scenarios, regardless of whether double degree programs are completed consecutively or concurrently, students must:\n\nBe admitted to both programs;\nFulfill the Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence, degree, and coursework credit requirements for each degree;\nComplete the specific degree requirements for each program, including minimum graduate degree, residence, and coursework (50%) credit requirements for each;\nHave no more than a 25% credit overlap between degrees, based on the lower credit requirements of the two programs;\nHave an advisor from each program and both advisors must be informed of each other.\n\nApproval of the double degree: at the time of graduation, each program must submit to the Graduate School a list of the courses being used to satisfy that program’s requirements. Both advisors must sign the course lists as indication of approval. The Graduate School will review the course lists for credit overlap between degrees.\nDoctoral students who add a master’s degree program outside the doctoral program cannot be dissertators.\nInternational students must contact International Student Services before adding a second degree program.\nSee Addition/Change of Program, Plan, or Named Option, Change of Degree Level (Plan), International Students Maintaining Legal Status, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Appendix 5 – Double, Joint, and Dual Degrees at a Glance\nDouble, Joint, and Dual Degrees Comparison\n\nMore\n\n\n\nDouble Degree\n\n2 degrees, 2 diplomas\n2 graduate majors\n2 advisors, 2 committees\n2 theses or dissertations\nMinimum Graduate School requirements for each degree\n2 prelims (PhD)\n2 warrant requests, 2 warrants\nList of courses used for each major must be submitted to GS when requesting warrants.\nNo more than 25% overlap (of the total credits for the program with lowest credit requirement).\n\nJoint Degree\n\n1 degree, 1 diploma\n2 graduate majors\n2 advisors, 1 committee\n1 thesis or dissertation\nJoint prelim, if both major programs agree, or 2 prelims (PhD)\n1 warrant request, 1 warrant\nMust submit proposal to GS before beginning of second year.  Need signatures of both advisors and both program directors, and Graduate School approval.\n\nDual Degree\n\nOne graduate degree and one professional degree (i.e. a degree from the School of Medicine and Public Health or the Law school).\nDual Degrees: Graduate and Professional Combination\n\nMore\n\n\n\nA dual degree is two degrees, one of which is granted in a graduate program, and the other in a professional school (e.g., MD, JD, DVM, DPharm, MPH). Students must inquire with each program prior to enrollment to see if additional policies exist that would restrict the ability to complete a dual degree.\nTo receive a dual degree students must:\n\nBe admitted to both programs;\nComplete the specific degree requirements for the Graduate School and the professional school;\nFulfill the Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence, degree, and coursework (50%) credit requirements for the graduate degree.\n\nTuition is determined by a combined fee schedule table. Assessed fees are roughly halfway between graduate fees and professional fees. Credit limits each semester coincide with the professional schools’ higher credit maximums. Find more information about the tuition and fees on the Bursar’s Office Tuition and Fees webpage.\nSee Addition/Change of Program, Plan, or Named Option, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Appendix 5 – Double, Joint, and Dual Degrees at a Glance\nEffective Date of Program Requirements upon Enrollment\n\nMore\n\n\n\nAny student entering or readmitted to a graduate program must adhere to the requirements in the most current Academic Policies & Procedures and Graduate Guide. This includes all new incoming students, those students continuing from a master’s degree to a doctoral degree, add/change program students, degree completion fee students, and any readmitted students. A student who chooses to discontinue their degree program for a semester or more would return under the requirements in the most recent Academic Policies & Procedures.\nStudents enrolled prior to fall 2014 in a MFA, specialist certificate, or doctoral degree program have the option to complete their degree under the prior policy requirements if they maintain continuous enrollment.\nA student who advances from the master’s level to the doctoral level fall 2014 or after is subject to the requirements in the most current Academic Policies & Procedures.\nAppeals will be considered in exceptional cases. The request for appeal must be made on a student-by-student basis. The appeal should come from the students faculty advisor and/or program chair and be sent to the Graduate School Director of Academic Services. The appeal should include sufficient justification for the request and any supporting documentation.\nSee Continuous Enrollment Requirement\nEnrollment\n\nMore\n\n\n\nCourse enrollment is available through MyUW in the Course Search and Enroll App or the Student Center. Once enrolled, students should confirm that they are enrolled in the appropriate number of graduate-level graded courses. Students should enroll early to avoid a late initial enrollment fee and class cancellation due to low enrollment. Visit the Office of the Registrar’s website for more information about enrollment deadlines.\nSee Enrollment Requirements\nEnrollment Accountability\n\nMore\n\n\n\nStudents are responsible for the accuracy of their enrollment/class schedule and for all tuition, fees, and academic consequences that result from that schedule. Continuing students in good standing may enroll for the next term without special permission from the Graduate School. Before enrolling, students should consult their advisor to approve their class schedule for that term and to determine if they need authorization for any proposed courses. Note that graduate students may not enroll in Honors credits, as those are for undergraduate students only.\nAll students must use the online enrollment system. Instructions on how to enroll using MyUW along with additional enrollment information is available through the Office of the Registrar’s website. The Office of the Registrar also provides enrollment demos and tutorials. All students will receive an email message from the Office of the Registrar about their assigned enrollment appointment time. Students can expect to receive this notification about one week prior to the beginning of the priority enrollment period. There are extra fees for late initial enrollment and late fee payment. These deadlines are available at the Office of the Registrar’s Enrollment Deadlines webpage.\nSee Enrollment, Enrollment Requirements, Holds, Late Enrollment/Late Course Change/Late Drop, Overloads, Readmission to Graduate School (for previously enrolled graduate students), Schedule of Classes\nEnrollment Confirmation\n\nMore\n\n\n\nStudents can confirm their current enrollment status through MyUW.\nFailure to receive a student account invoice does not relieve students of the obligation to meet established fee payment deadlines as displayed in the MyUW Student Center, Class Search. If a student does not receive an invoice by late August (mid-January for spring semester), they can get a copy at the Bursar’s Office.\nEnrollment Requirements\n\nMore\n\n\n\nALL of the following credit requirements (except F-1 and J-1 visa requirements) must be satisfied by graded courses taken at 300 or above; courses numbered below 300, audit, and pass/fail do not satisfy enrollment requirements.\nFull-time enrollment: The Graduate School considers full-time enrollment to be 8-15 graded credits* taken at 300 or above, excluding pass/fail and audit, during the fall and spring semesters, and 4-12 credits* during the summer term. Dissertators are considered full-time at 3 credits. If students elect not to enroll as full-time students as defined by the Graduate School, they are responsible for knowing about possible obligations that may require full-time status. Such obligations may include visa eligibility, fellowships, assistantships, financial aid, external funding agencies, and program satisfactory progress requirements.\nMaximum enrollment: Non-dissertator maximum credit load is 15 graded credits* taken at 300 or above during the fall and spring semester and 12 credits during the summer term. Any exceptions to the maximum credit load permitted must be obtained via the Credit Overload Request form.\nMinimum enrollment: Non-dissertator minimum credit load is 2 credits* during the fall and spring semesters. Graduate students must be enrolled in their program for at least the minimum requirement in the semester in which they receive a degree; master’s degree students expecting a summer degree must be enrolled in their program for a minimum of 2 graduate credits in any summer session*. Graduate students who do not need to maintain full-time status (including TAs and PAs) have a 2 credit enrollment minimum during fall and spring semesters. Minimum requirements must be fulfilled by courses taken for a grade (not pass/fail or audit) and must be taken at 300 or above.\nUnderload: During the fall and spring semesters, non-dissertators must enroll for a minimum of 2 credits.* Audit and pass/fail courses do not satisfy this enrollment requirement. Dissertators are required to enroll for 3 graded credits taken at 300 or above and directly related to their dissertation research.\nThe specific situations listed below have special enrollment requirements.\nDissertators: Dissertators must enroll in exactly 3 credits* directly related to their dissertation (generally research and thesis or required seminars) during fall and spring semesters. Dissertators are considered full-time at 3 credits*. Dissertators who are summer RAs, trainees or fellows, or who expect to graduate in summer, must enroll in the general 8-week summer session (DHH) for 3 credits*. Additional courses for credit, audit, or pass/fail will result in removal of dissertator status and tuition assessment at the regular graduate rate.\nOnce dissertator status has been achieved, courses other than 990 must be directly related to the dissertation research and approved by the advisor. Dissertators must enroll during the semester or general 8-week summer session (DHH) in which they expect to earn a degree. Students must be enrolled during the semester when they defend the dissertation and when they deposit the dissertation. If defending and depositing in two different semesters, the student is required to be enrolled in both semesters. Students do not have to be dissertators during the semester or summer in which they expect to earn a doctoral degree, but they must be eligible for dissertator status before they complete the doctoral degree, and they must enroll in the semester in which they will graduate.\nIf a student enrolls before the dissertator status is approved, the enrollment system may indicate they are not eligible for that course. The enrollment system does not care if students are dissertators. If students had problems getting into a course, it is probably because permission has not been entered into the enrollment system. Most individualized study courses, such as research and thesis, require instructor’s permission and online authorization before enrollment is possible.\nIf dissertator status is not processed by the segregated fee deadline, students should register for 3 credits and pay regular non-dissertator graduate fees. The fee difference will be adjusted for that semester when dissertator status is indicated in the system.\nMaster’s with thesis required: A master’s degree candidate required to submit a thesis to Memorial Library, as indicated on the degree warrant, must be enrolled in the semester in which they defend their thesis. If a student defends in a window period, they need to have been enrolled in the previous term. A student does not need to be enrolled to deposit their thesis to Memorial Library.\nAssistantship appointees: It is against university policy to hold an assistantship without being appropriately enrolled.  Assistantships include those at UW-Madison as well as any UW System institution, including UW–Extension.\nRA (Research Assistant): RAs are required to carry a full load each semester (8 to 15 credits* including research or thesis credits for non-dissertators, 3 credits* for dissertators) and at least 2 credits* during the general 8-week summer session (DHH) (3 credits* for dissertators). Dissertators who hold assistantships are considered full-time with 3 credits* directly related to their dissertation.\nTA (Teaching Assistant) and PA (Project Assistant):\nMinimum enrollment for PAs and TAs is 2 credits* (3 credits* for dissertators) during the fall and spring semesters.\n\nTo be considered full-time by the Registrar for loan deferment and for certification of student immigration status, non-dissertator PAs and TAs who hold an appointment of at least 33.33% must be enrolled for 6 credits*, or those who hold an appointment of at least 50% must be enrolled for 4 credits*.\nDissertator PAs and TAs are considered full-time with 3 credits* directly related to their dissertation (generally research and thesis or required seminars).\nMaximum enrollment for PAs and TAs is 15 credits* during the fall and spring.\nThe Graduate School has no enrollment requirement for the summer session for PAs and TAs, unless the student is receiving a summer degree, but individual programs may.\n\nFellows: Non-dissertator graduate students holding fellowships that are payrolled through the university must be enrolled full-time: 8 credits* during the fall and spring semester. Fellows who are non-dissertators with 12-month appointments must also enroll in 2 credits* during the general 8-week summer session (DHH). Those who are not payrolled as fellows over the summer are not required to be enrolled. Those who are payrolled as fellows during any part of the summer term must enroll in the general 8-week summer session (DHH). Fellows who are dissertators must enroll in 3 credits* during the fall and spring semesters. Fellows with 12-month appointments who are dissertators must also enroll in 3 credits* during the general 8-week summer session (DHH).\nTrainees: Trainees must carry a full load each fall and spring semester of 8 to 15 credits* including research or thesis credits for non-dissertators (3 credits* for dissertators), and at least 2 credits* during the general 8-week summer session (DHH) (3 credits* for dissertators).\nInternational students: Both F-1 and J-1 student visa regulations require students to be enrolled full-time each fall and spring semester (8 credits, not taken as audit). Summer enrollment is not required by the U.S. federal government regulations for F-1/J-1 visa holders. However, summer enrollment may be required due to other circumstances; see summer enrollment requirements for assistantships, fellowships, traineeships, and graduating students. Failure to maintain full-time status can result in loss of F-1/J-1 student benefits, including on-campus employment and practical/academic training options. Any exceptions to full-time enrollment must be authorized by International Student Services (ISS). Visit the ISS webpage to learn more about visa requirements. Permission from ISS to drop below full-time enrollment does NOT exempt an international student from meeting the enrollment requirement determined by a Teaching Assistantship (TA), Project Assistantship (PA), Research Assistantship (RA), fellowship, traineeship, or dissertator status.\nInternational students-online learning credit limit: F-1 and J-1 student visa holders have restrictions regarding the number of online credits that can be taken during the semester as it relates to fulfilling the full-time enrollment requirement.  There are also restrictions regarding online enrollment during the final term of study-especially when the final term for completion is in summer. For more information, visit the ISS Online Course Enrollment webpage.\nSummer enrollment requirements: Students must be enrolled at UW–Madison if they are using university facilities, including faculty and staff time.\n\nDissertators defending and/or depositing dissertation (completing their degree) in summer must enroll for 3 credits* in the general 8-week summer session (DHH).\nDissertator RAs must enroll for 3 credits* in the general 8-week summer session (DHH).\nDissertator fellows with 12-month appointments are required to enroll for 3 credits* in the general 8-week summer session (DHH).\nDissertator trainees with 12-month appointments are required to enroll for 3 credits* in the general 8-week summer session (DHH).\nMaster’s candidates, who expect to graduate in summer must enroll for at least 2 credits* in any session, short session or general 8-week summer session (DHH).\nNon-dissertators completing a summer doctoral degree must enroll for at least 2 credits* in the general 8-week summer session (DHH).\nNon-dissertator RAs must enroll for 2 credits* in the general 8-week summer session (DHH).\nNon-dissertator TAs and PAs not receiving a summer degree have no enrollment requirement. However, those who held such an appointment during the previous semester may qualify for summer tuition remission and are advised to consult with their employing department if they wish to enroll.\nNon-dissertator fellows with 12-month appointments are required to enroll for at least 2 credits* in the general 8-week summer session (DHH).\nNon-dissertator trainees are required to enroll for at least 2 credits* in the general 8-week summer session (DHH).\nInternational students who are completing a summer degree are required to enroll for at least 2 credits* in the general 8-week summer session (DHH).\nInternational students who are RAs in the summer are required to enroll for at least 2 credits* in the general 8-week summer session (DHH).\nInternational students who are not completing a summer degree and who are not RAs have no summer enrollment requirement mandated by the U.S. federal government regulations for F-1/J-1 visa holders.\n\nFinancial aid, loan deferral & taxes: In most cases, students are eligible for federal loans and federal loan payment deferral when enrolled at least half-time, which is 4 credits* for the fall and spring semesters. However, individual cases may vary, and students are advised to seek individual advice at the UW–Madison Office of Student Financial Aid. Payroll and FICA taxes can be impacted if students are not enrolled at least half-time. More information can be found here.\nFull-Time Enrollment Status at a Glance\nALL of the following credit requirements (except F-1 and J-1 visa requirements) must be satisfied by graded courses taken at 300 or above; courses numbered below 300, audit, and pass/fail do not satisfy enrollment requirements.\n\n\n\nCategories\nMinimum enrollment for full-time status: Fall or Spring\nMinimum enrollment for full-time status: Summer (general 8-week DHH session)\n\n\n\n\nDissertator\nExactly 3 credits directly related to research\nNot required unless receiving summer degree or if RA, trainee (with 12-month appointment), or fellow (with 12-month appointment), 3 cr. required.\n\n\nRA, non-dissertator\n8 cr.\n2 cr.\n\n\nTA/Lecturer (SA) 33%, non-dissertator\n6 cr.\nNot required unless receiving summer degree, 2 cr. minimum.\n\n\nTA/Lecturer (SA) 50%, non-dissertator\n4 cr.\nNot required unless receiving summer degree, 2 cr. minimum.\n\n\nPA 33%, non-dissertator\n6 cr.\nNot required unless receiving summer degree, 2 cr. minimum.\n\n\nPA 50%, non-dissertator\n4 cr.\nNot required unless receiving summer degree, 2 cr. minimum.\n\n\nFellow, non-dissertator\n8 cr.\n2 cr. for 12-month appointments.

The survey collects information on academic experiences, advising, and future plans.\nSurvey of Earned Doctorates (SED): The SED is a federally-sponsored national survey of individuals receiving research degrees from all U.S. institutions and the results are used to assess characteristics and trends in doctoral education. The SED is to be completed by PhD students, not DMA, DNP or AuD students.\nGraduate School Doctoral Exit Survey (DES): The Graduate School surveys all students graduating with a doctoral degree. The DES collects additional information on academic experiences, e.g., advising and other academic support.\nMaster’s Degree Completion Survey: All students completing master’s degrees are asked to answer a brief online survey about their plans for employment or for additional education. Students will receive an email with a link to the survey at the time of the final warrant request.\nThe doctoral exit surveys must be completed before submitting your dissertation electronically. Each individual survey will provide a certificate of completion once you have submitted the survey. The individual certificates of completion should each be saved as PDF documents to be uploaded in the administrative documents section of the ProQuest/UMI ETD Administrator website.\nDirections for completing the doctoral surveys are in the Graduate School’s Guide to Preparing your Doctoral Dissertation.\nSee Final Oral Examination (Defense)\nExtension Courses\n\nMore\n\n\n\nA student paying full-time tuition and fees at the UW–Madison campus may ask to take courses at UW–Extension for no additional cost (if the total credit load does not exceed the maximum allowable credit load). A student’s faculty advisor must submit a completed UW–Madison Tuition Waiver Request Form, along with a letter of endorsement to the Graduate School. If the Graduate School approves, the student may take the course without paying additional fees. Courses completed at UW–Extension do not fulfill the Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence, degree, or coursework credit requirements and will not appear on the student’s UW–Madison transcript. Dissertators are not allowed to request a tuition waiver while remaining eligible for the dissertator fee status, they would need to request to be removed from dissertator status and enroll full-time and pay fees at the regular graduate student fee rate.\nSee Dissertator Status, Enrollment Requirements, Overloads\nFailing Grades\n\nMore\n\n\n\nCourses numbered 300 and above graded F are included in the graduate GPA and do not count toward the Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence, degree, and coursework (50%) credit requirements.\nSee Grade Point Average (GPA) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Repeating Courses\nFamily Leave\n\nMore\n\n\n\nAlthough the Graduate School does not have a formal leave of absence policy for pre-dissertators, there are a number of family-friendly practices and resources for students considering taking a leave of absence for birth or adoption. Many departments and programs also have local policies. Students should consult with their program coordinator, advisor, and the Graduate School’s Office Academic Services as early as possible in their planning process.\nPlease visit the Graduate School’s Family and Parent Resources webpage for additional information.\nSee Compassionate Tuition Adjustment, Leave of Absence\nFellowships\n\nMore\n\n\n\nFellowships are monetary awards that students use to pursue graduate studies. In general, fellowships require no work obligations on the part of the recipient.\nCampus Fellowships: Merit-based campus and departmental fellowships are sometimes awarded to UW–Madison graduate students by their graduate programs. To inquire about eligibility and application procedures, students must contact their graduate program.\nExternal Fellowships: Many federal agencies, professional organizations, and private foundations provide fellowships for students pursuing graduate studies. Students are encouraged to look for and apply for external fellowships, and to understand the unique terms and conditions of each fellowship for which they apply. The Graduate School supports a number of federal/private fellowships through the provision of tuition support and health insurance. If students are awarded one of these fellowships, they should contact the UW–Madison Fellowship Officer at funding@grad.wisc.edu.\nInternational Fellowships: The Institute for Regional and International Studies serves as a resource center and provides information and support to faculty, students, and staff interested in identifying international research grants, scholarships, and other funding opportunities, including programs sponsored by Fulbright, National Security Education Program (Boren Scholarship), HEA (Higher Education Act), Title VI-FLAS (Foreign Languages and Area Studies), and other program competitions. Questions about funding for international research should be directed to the Institute for Regional and International Studies (IRIS).\nFor further information on fellowships, visit the Graduate School’s Funding Information webpage.\nSee Enrollment Requirements, International Students Maintaining Legal Status, Maximum Levels of Appointments, Tuition Remission, Payroll Benefits for Graduate Assistants, Fellows, and Trainees\nFinal Examination (Dissertation Defense)\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe final examination (often called “defense”) normally covers a student’s dissertation and areas of study. Students may not take the final examination until they have satisfied all other requirements for their degree. Students’ records must be cleared of incomplete grades and progress grades (other than research) before they can take the final exam.\nDoctoral students have five years from the date of passing their preliminary examinations to take their final examination and deposit their dissertation. Arrangements for the final examination and the  examination committee’s approval of the dissertation are the responsibilities of the student and the program. The graduate program coordinator must submit the final doctoral warrant request to the Graduate School at least three weeks before the final examination.\nAfter the graduate program coordinator submits the doctoral degree warrant request, the Graduate School will review this request and send the approved doctoral degree warrant to the graduate program coordinator. The final warrant should be printed out and committee member signatures should be obtained the defense. To pass the examination, students must receive no more than one dissenting vote from their committee. A missing signature is considered a dissent. Once the final warrant has been signed, an electronic copy should be uploaded in the administrative documents section of the ProQuest/UMI ETD Administrator website. The original signed hard copy of the final warrant should be kept with the student or the graduate program coordinator. For further information, visit the Graduate School’s Guide to Preparing Your Doctoral Dissertation.\nSee Preliminary Examinations, Time Limits\nFive-Year Rule\n\nMore\n\n\n\nStudents have five years from the date of their preliminary examination to take their final oral examination and deposit their dissertation.\nSee Preliminary Examinations, Time Limits\nForms\n\nMore\n\n\n\nAdd/Change Program\nCredit Overload\nLate Course Add\nLate Course Drop\nLate Initial Enrollment\nDegree Completion Fee Request\nTranscript Request\nWithdrawal\nGrade Change\n\nMore\n\n\n\nGrade changes originate with the instructor of the course. The instructor submits a grade change through the MyUW Faculty Center. Instructions are available through the Office of the Registrar’s Grading FAQ webpage. If the change cannot be completed via the online system, the instructor submits a paper Grade Change Form, and the program chair signs and submits it to the Graduate School Office of Academic Services.\nWhile changes from Incomplete or Progress to a final grade are routine and raise no questions, changes from one final grade to another are more serious matters. Doing extra work to improve a final grade is not allowed. Faculty legislation states that final grades can be changed only because of clerical error. Once an instructor announces course grades, a decision to re-evaluate the coursework for all or some of the students breaks faith with those students. The university’s primary concern is that all students in a course are treated consistently and fairly when assigned final grades.\nGrade Point Average (GPA) Requirement\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe Graduate School requires that students maintain a graduate grade-point average (GPA) of 3.00 (on a 4.00 scale) for all graduate courses (excluding research) to receive a degree. Many programs impose higher standards. Students should check with their program.\nWhen a graduate student’s cumulative GPA drops below a 3.0 for one semester, they are notified via email (copy to grad coordinator) that they are placed on academic probation, and an enrollment hold is placed on the following semester. Students on academic probation cannot continue enrolling until the probationary semester’s grades are reported and their cumulative GPA is above a 3.0.\nCourses taken for audit (S/NR), credit/no credit (CR/N), or pass/fail do not affect the GPA. Research courses graded on a Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) basis do not impact GPA. However, U grades are monitored by the Graduate School for satisfactory progress. A Permanent Incomplete (PI) grade does not impact the GPA. A No Report (NR) or Incomplete (I) grade does not impact the GPA, but in a graded course this is a temporary grade, indicating the instructor has not yet submitted a final grade.\nSee Auditing Courses, Credit/No Credit Grades, No Report (NR) Grades, Pass/Fail, Permanent Incomplete (PI) Grade, Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) Grades, Appendix 3 – Grading System, Appendix 4 – Grade-Point Average Calculation\nGrading System\n\nMore\n\n\n\nUW–Madison uses a 4.00 grading scale (A=4.00, AB=3.50, etc.). Grades are assigned only by instructors and are electronically reported by letter grade. Plus and minus grades are not used.\nStudents should check with individual professors about grading scales for specific courses.\nAll courses taken as a graduate student that are numbered 300 and above in which a student receives a grade of A, AB, B, BC, C, or S will count toward the Graduate School’s minimum credit requirement.  Courses with grades of P (“in progress”) fulfill the Graduate School’s minimum credit requirement only if they are research courses.  Courses taken under the 300 level, or for audit, pass/fail; or in which a  student receives grades of D or F do not count.\nFor courses listed as research, the only permissible final grades are P (Progress), S (Satisfactory), or U (Unsatisfactory). If a P grade is assigned, it will remain until the faculty member assigns a grade of S or U. All previously assigned P grades in research courses will revert to an S or U upon assignment of the final grade. Research courses (even with grades from terms earlier than Summer 1999) do not count in a student’s GPA. Research courses are traditionally reserved for graduate students; however, other students (Law, Medical, Undergraduate, etc.) occasionally enroll for a research course. In these cases, the student’s college can decide to have the course count in the GPA with an academic action submitted to the Office of the Registrar.\nTo convert UW–Madison Law School numerical grades to the Graduate School’s grading scale, the Graduate School uses the following scale:\n85-100 A\n83-84 AB\n77-82 B\n75-76 BC\n72-74 C\n67-71 D\n65-66 F\nInternational equivalencies may be available in the Wisconsin Directory of International Institutions.\nSee Grade Point Average (GPA) Requirement, Permanent Incomplete (PI) Grade, Progress (P) Grades, Grading System and GPA Calculation\nGrading System and GPA Calculation\n\nMore\n\n\n\nGrades are assigned only by instructors and are reported only by letter grade. Plus and minus grades are not accepted.\nThe university uses the following grading system:\nGrade Grade-points per credit\n\nA Excellent 4\nAB Intermediate 3.5\nB Good 3\nBC Intermediate 2.5\nC Fair 2\nD Poor 1\nF Failure 0\n\nThe following grades have no associated grade points and are excluded from the graduate Grade Point Average (GPA):\n\nS Satisfactory\nU Unsatisfactory\nI Incomplete (a temporary grade when work is not completed)\nP Progress\nPI Permanent Incomplete\nDR Dropped\nW Withdrew\nCR Credit\nN No Credit\nIN Incomplete in Credit/No Credit Course (a temporary grade when work is not completed)\nM Missing – used for audited courses\nNR No Report (a temporary grade for a graded course when a final grade has not been submitted by the instructor; a final grade for an audited course when the student did not meet the instructor’s minimum standards)\nNW No Work – used for non-attendance in a course\nQ Question on Credits\n\nGPA Calculation\n\nTo calculate graduate GPA:\n\nRefer to the list above to find the grade-point value of each letter grade on your transcript.\nMultiply the grade-point value by the number of credits for the course. For example, a three (3) credit AB would be calculated as:\n\n\n\n\n3.5\ngrade-points for an AB\n\n\n×\n3\ncredits\n\n\n\n10.5\ngrade-points\n\n\n\n\nContinue this calculation for every course numbered 300 and above that you took as a graduate student. Do include independent study courses and seminars. Do not include research courses; each department determines course numbers for their research courses. Do not include courses taken as a University Special student. Add the total number of grade points earned and the total number of credits earned.\nDivide the total number of grade points by the total number of credits.\n\n\n\n\n215\ngrade-points\n\n\n÷\n60\ncredits\n\n\n\n3.58\nGPA\n\n\n\n\nThis final figure is your graduate GPA.\n\n\n\nThe UW–Madison Cross College Advising Service GPA Calculator may be a useful tool.\nGraduate/Professional Certificates\n\nMore\n\n\n\nGraduate/professional certificates are available to all degree-seeking graduate and professional students (GRAD, LAW, MED, PHARM, VMED careers) and may be used by doctoral students in meeting their breadth requirement (see policy on Breadth Requirement in Doctoral Training). Graduate/professional certificate programs coordinate teaching and research among scholars active in interrelated disciplines. Consult the certificate program regarding recognition of program completion. Certificate programs monitor their own course and satisfactory progress requirements.\nStudents wishing to pursue a certificate must submit a request to add it to their academic career through the Add/Change/Discontinue application process in the MyGradPortal. This should be done as soon as a student knows they wish to add the certificate and before completing the classes for the certificate.  The certificate must be on the student’s academic career before the prelim (doctoral students) or degree warrant (master’s students) is requested.\nA list of all graduate/professional certificates with specific information for each is  available in the Graduate Guide on the Graduate/Professional Certificates page.\nSee Capstone Certificates\nGraduation\n\nMore\n\n\n\nTo receive a master’s degree, students contact their program coordinator at the beginning of the term in which they intend to graduate. The program coordinator will check that they have met program requirements and will request a warrant from the Graduate School on the student’s behalf. Students need to be enrolled in their program and taking a minimum of 2 credits (graded courses taken at 300 or above; audits and pass/fails do not satisfy this requirement) during the term in which they intend to graduate. For more information and deadlines visit the Graduate School’s Completing Your Master’s Degree webpage.\nDoctoral candidates’ major programs should request a final doctoral warrant at least 3 weeks before the anticipated date of their final dissertation defense. Doctoral candidates must be enrolled during the term in which they intend to defend or graduate. For more information and deadlines visit the Graduate School’s Completing Your Doctoral Degree webpage.\nSee Certification of Graduation (or ‘Degree Completion Letter’), Deadlines, Degree Completion Fee, Degree Conferral/Payroll End Dates, Dissertation and Thesis Standards and Publishing, Dissertation Defense (Final Examination)\nGrievances and Appeals\n\nMore\n\n\n\nIf a student feels unfairly treated or aggrieved by faculty, staff, or another student, the university offers several avenues to resolve the concern. All graduate programs, departments and schools/colleges have established specific grievance procedures for handling such situations; these grievance procedures are found in the program’s Graduate Guide page under the policy tab.\nThe department-school/college academic grievance process should be used to resolve academic issues or disputes. Examples of matters suitable for this process may include a qualifying exam failure, author dispute, or concerns regarding advising/mentoring, to name a few.\nGraduate Assistants in TA, PA and/or RA appointments may utilize the Graduate Assistantship Policies and Procedures (GAPP) grievance process to resolve employment-related issues. Examples of matters appropriate for the GAPP grievance process include allegations of violation of GAPP, including allegations excessive work hours, violations of sick days or vacation policies, or disputes regarding the assignment of duties.\nFor issues involving hostile and intimidating behavior (HIB) by a faculty or staff member, students should contact the Graduate School Assistant Dean for Academic Services for information on accessing the the appropriate HIB process.\nFor issues involving civil rights, ADA, Equal Opportunity or Sexual Misconduct, students should contact the Office of Compliance.\nIf you have questions about whether the grievance policy at the program level or GAPP procedure would be suitable for your concern, you are encouraged to reach out to your college, school or division human resources representative.\nThrough A Graduate Student Guide to Working with Faculty Advisors, an interactive, self-paced micro-course, graduate students learn about the characteristics of functional and dysfunctional relationships with faculty advisors, strategies for communicating effectively and aligning expectations, as well as program grievance processes and Hostile and Intimidating Behavior resources. Completion of the micro-course takes about 20 minutes and is optional but encouraged for all graduate students.\nIn addition, the following administrative offices have procedures available for addressing various concerns:\nOffice of Student Assistance and Support (for all issues of concern involving students)\n70 Bascom Hall\n608-263-5700\nEmployee Assistance Office (for conflicts involving graduate assistants and other employees)\nRm. 1109 WARF Building, 610 Walnut St.\n608-263-2987\nOmbuds Office for Faculty and Staff (for graduate students and post-docs, as well as faculty and staff)\n523-524 Lowell Center\n608-265-9992\nGraduate School (for informal advice at any level of review and for official appeals of program/departmental or school/college grievance decisions)\n217 Bascom Hall\n500 Lincoln Drive\nMadison, WI 53706-1380\n608-262-2433\nGraduate students have two levels of appeal when they disagree with the outcome of a grievance or academic decision made at the program/departmental level; these occur in sequence. The first appeal is to the school/college and final appeals are to the Graduate School.\nGraduate School Appeal Process\nGraduate students who believe their appeal was not appropriately handled or resolved at the school/college level may appeal to the Graduate School using the process described below. (For students in programs housed in the Graduate School, the appeal of a program decision will typically be handled by the school/college in which the faculty/academic advisor of the student has their tenure/primary appointment before an appeal may be considered by the Graduate School.)\nAppeals of school/college decisions to the Graduate School should be based upon one or both of the following grounds:\n\nThere was a procedural error that substantially affected the fairness or outcome of the school/college grievance or academic decision appeal process.\nThe information in the record does not support the school/college decision.\n\nIf a student believes that their appeal meets one or both grounds listed above, they may file an official appeal of a school/college decision with the Graduate School using the process described below.\nA student must submit an appeal to the Graduate School Assistant Dean for Academic Services within 14 calendar days of the school/college decision. Prior to submitting an appeal, students are encouraged to contact the Assistant Dean to obtain information about the process, timelines, and to seek clarification of any questions they may have about the process.\nTo be considered, appeals must include the following information:\n\nThe student’s name, local address, university email address and phone number.\nThe student’s program name and degree level.\nThe ground(s) upon which the appeal is based and for each ground stated, an explanation of why the student’s appeal meets those criteria.\nCopies of the department and school/college appeal decisions and any other relevant communications.\n\nUpon receipt of all the above materials:\n\nThe Assistant Dean for Academic Services will forward the appeal and related documents to the Dean of the Graduate School.\nThe student will be notified in writing within 10 calendar days after the appeal materials arrive in the Graduate School, acknowledging receipt of the formal appeal and giving the student a timeline for the appeal to be completed.\nThe program and school/college will be notified of the appeal to the Graduate School and will be provided with a copy of the student’s appeal statement and associated documents.  The program and school/college will be invited to submit a written response.\nThe dean will appoint an advisory committee comprised of faculty and/or staff with the appropriate expertise to evaluate the appeal.\nThe dean will charge the committee and set appropriate time frame (30 calendar days within the fall and spring semester; appeals received in the summer may take up to 60 calendar days) for completing a review and making a recommendation.\n\n\nThe committee will review the student’s appeal, including all the materials previously submitted. If necessary, the committee may request and review additional information relevant to the appeal from the student and/or program/department/School/College before making a recommendation.\nThe dean will issue the final decision in writing.\nHolds (Service Indicators)\n\nMore\n\n\n\nWhen using the enrollment system, students may encounter holds on their records, preventing them from enrolling in classes. Holds can also prevent students from obtaining a transcript, a degree completion letter, certification of status, or a diploma. Their enrollment notification will indicate the type of hold and where it must be cleared. Hold information is also available on MyUW. Students should direct questions to the originator of the hold.\nSee Dean’s Approval, Probation\nHonors Courses\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe Graduate School does not have an honors program, and graduate students may not enroll in Honors Only courses or in Honors Optional courses for honors credit or otherwise receive honors credit for completing optional extra work in a course. If a graduate student enrolls in a mixed graduate/undergraduate course section with an Honors Optional designation, the graduate student must maintain the default “do not take with honors” selection for their enrollment. If a graduate student does select “take with Honors” as part of their enrollment for such a course, the Graduate School will remove that Honors status.\nIncompletes\n\nMore\n\n\n\nStudents who are unable to complete coursework by the end of the semester may request from the instructor the assignment of the temporary grade of “I” (Incomplete).  Students making a request for an I grade must have been carrying passing grade until near the end of the term.  If the Incomplete grade is granted the student should complete the missing work as soon as possible.  Students who receive an Incomplete grade will receive a warning message from the Graduate School, reminding them that students are not permitted to graduate with an Incomplete grade on their transcripts. Graduate students are allowed the subsequent semester of enrollment to complete the coursework before the Graduate School will place the student on academic probation. Programs may impose more stringent rules for satisfactory progress.\nIn consultation with the program, students may be dismissed from the Graduate School for failing to complete coursework and receive a final grade in a timely fashion.\nStudents with outstanding Incomplete grades may not receive  dissertator status or be granted a degree.\nIf the work is no longer relevant, the instructor of a course is no longer at the university, or a change of program makes completion of the work unnecessary, students may be allowed to receive a Permanent Incomplete (PI) for the course. The instructor of the course or their advisor submits a grade change request with an explanation or reason, changing the grade from I to PI. The Office of the Registrar also converts any incomplete grade over 5 years old to PI. Students may graduate with PI’s on their transcript.\nUnresolved Incomplete grades lapse to a grade of Permanent Incomplete (PI) after five years.\nSee Permanent Incomplete (PI) Grade, Probation, Satisfactory Progress\nIndividual Development Plan\n\nMore\n\n\n\nUW–Madison recommends all graduate students and postdoctoral researchers utilize Individual Development Plans to set academic and career goals and facilitate conversations with their mentor(s). All graduate students and postdoctoral researchers supported by NIH funding are required to have an Individual Development Plan (IDP). Other funding agencies may have additional requirements related to the IDP.\nIDPs are written plans that give mentees ownership and structure to assess their skills, interests, and values, define clear and actionable goals, explore career options, and facilitate conversations with their mentor(s). IDP forms vary greatly, although many are structured around core competencies or learning outcomes. The onus for writing, maintaining, and implementing the plan is on the mentee, and conversations with and feedback from the mentor(s) are essential.\nThe Graduate School will identify individuals who must complete an IDP and will notify them of tools and resources available. The Graduate School will offer graduate students, postdocs, and PIs tools to track IDP progress. The IDP tracking tool will log activity related to the IDP, but the actual contents of the IDP will not be captured by the tracking tool. The contents of the IDP are private to the mentee, who chooses which parts of the IDP to share with his or her selected mentor(s). Find the IDP template for graduate students and postdoc mentees, guidelines and other supporting resources for mentors and mentees, resources for PIs and grants administrators, including the IDP tracking tool.\nInsurance and Medical Benefits\n\nMore\n\n\n\nIf students have been awarded a fellowship, traineeship, or an assistantship with at least a one-third (33%) appointment per term (or an equivalent), they qualify for full medical benefits. In order to activate medical insurance benefits, students contact their department’s/program’s benefits coordinator.\nStudents who are currently enrolled as UW–Madison students and have paid segregated fees can also use the services of University Health Services (UHS). University Health Services is the health clinic on campus, open to any current UW–Madison student (excluding guest students). UHS offers insurance through SHIP (Student Health Insurance Plan), which is located on the premises. SHIP is a comprehensive insurance plan for UW–Madison students that covers additional health care costs incurred both at UHS and elsewhere. This includes travel and meningitis immunizations, prescription drugs, and oral contraceptives at UHS as well as after hours, emergency room, hospitalization, and other specialized medical services locally and nationwide.\nFor more information or questions, contact UHS or SHIP.\nInternational students, or visiting J-1 scholars, and their visa dependents residing in the U.S. must meet the mandatory health insurance requirements of UW–Madison. International students must show compliance with these requirements by registering with the SHIP office. Students may register either by enrolling in the SHIP Health Plan or by filing a waiver application (if they satisfy the qualifying conditions). Failure to register by the specified deadlines will result in a $100 late fee in addition to any required SHIP premiums.\nPlease note: Students do not have to file a waiver if they have employment through UW–Madison and they meet all of the following conditions:\n\nThey are employed at UW–Madison and are receiving full medical benefits which were effective on or before September 1 (for fall) or February 1 (for spring/summer).\nThey are a member of one of the following health insurance plans: Group Health Cooperative, Unity Health Plans, Physicians Plus, Dean Health Care, or Standard Plan.\nThey are the primary subscriber (not a dependent) of their health insurance plan.\n\nIf a student meets all of the above criteria, the SHIP office will file an automatic waiver on his/her behalf.\nAdditional information regarding SHIP, including enrollment and waiver policies, can be found here.\nGraduate students traveling abroad for study or research are encouraged to acquire international health insurance through Cultural Insurance Services International (CISI). All University of Wisconsin students studying/traveling abroad under a UW sponsored program must enroll in health insurance through CISI). Further information about international health insurance can be found here.\nSee Benefits, Appendix 2 – Payroll Benefits\nJoint Degrees\n\nMore\n\n\n\nA joint degree consists of one graduate degree with two programs. A student completing a joint degree writes one thesis or dissertation and receives one diploma. Students can earn a joint master’s or a joint doctoral degree. Such degrees are relatively rare. Students should inquire with each program prior to enrollment to see if additional policies exist that would restrict the ability to complete a joint degree.\nTo apply for a joint degree a student must submit a proposal for the degree to the Graduate School along with an electronic Add/Change/Discontinue Program Request. A student must be admitted to the second program. An appropriate Associate Dean of the Graduate School reviews all such proposals.\nStudents must submit the proposal before they complete the coursework and no later than the beginning of their second year of graduate study.\nThe joint degree proposal must address the following issues:\n\nReasons for seeking a joint degree, rather than following the traditional program/minor curriculum (for doctoral programs that require a minor) or double degrees curriculum (for master’s programs).\nCoursework necessary to satisfy each program’s requirements; two separate course lists required.\nThe required content of each program’s portion of the degree requirements in the proposal (for example, preliminary exam arrangements for the doctoral degree or a joint thesis required for the master’s degree, etc.).\n\nTo receive a joint degree, students must:\n\nBe admitted to both programs, with approval of their proposal from both programs;\nComplete the degree requirements in each program as outlined in the proposal;\nFulfill the Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence, degree, and coursework (50%) credit requirements.\nBe recommended for the degree by the faculty co-chairs/advisors from each program and the program director from each program, approval signatures required.\n\nOnce a joint degree proposal has been reviewed and approved, any and all changes must be submitted to the Graduate School for further review.\nFor further details about joint degrees, contact the Graduate School Office of Academic Services.\nSee Double Degrees, Dual Degrees: Graduate and Professional Combination, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Special Graduate Committee Degrees, Appendix 5 – Double, Joint, and Dual Degrees at a Glance\nJury Duty\n\nMore\n\n\n\nIf a student is called to jury duty and the duty is sustained over a period of three weeks or more, the student should be allowed to withdraw from classes. If extended jury duty should continue after the last day of class, the instructor has the option of assigning an Incomplete (I) as the student’s grade. The I grade will not result in academic probation or the removal of dissertator status. Further information is available at Graduate School’s Office of Academic Services.\nLanguage Requirements\n\nMore\n\n\n\nEach program sets its own language requirements. Some programs require competence in one or more languages before students can take preliminary examinations. Students must check with their major program’s criteria for satisfactory progress in the program’s student handbook, or in the Graduate Guide.\nLate Enrollment/Late Course Change/Late Drop\n\nMore\n\n\n\nIt is a student’s responsibility to be aware of the deadlines for enrollment each term. All session deadlines are adhered to as detailed on the Office of the Registrar’s Enrollment Deadlines page.\nLate Initial Enrollment: Students have through the end of the second week to enroll in courses for fall or spring term. If students enroll after the first week of class, they are subject to late payment fees. Permission to enroll late does not excuse students from paying late initial enrollment and/or late payment penalties. Exceptions to the published deadlines will be granted only in the case of truly mitigating circumstances. Late initial enrollment cannot be completed in MyUW; a Late initial Enrollment Request Form must be submitted along with written approval from the student’s faculty advisor. Refer to the chart below for detailed steps to late initial enrollment.\nLate course changes (add a class, change credit, change sections): After deadlines have passed, late course adds can be requested by submitting a completed Late Course Add Request Form to the Graduate School. Other courses changes may be requested via the Course Change Request in MyUW. For more information, see the Registrar’s Office enrollment overview.  For all changes, the Course Change Request must be printed from MyUW and required signatures must be obtained along with written approval from the student’s faculty advisor. Refer to the chart below for detailed steps to late course changes. The Dean’s signature will be fulfilled once submitted to the Graduate School.\nLate Drop: The electronic Course Change Request process via MyUW Student Center is not accessible for late drops. Students must complete the Graduate School Late Course Drop Request Form along with written justification from the student’s faculty advisor. Please note that poor academic performance in a course is not an acceptable reason for a late drop request.  Refer to the chart below for detailed steps to late drops.\n\n\n\nAction\nWhen During the Semester\nStudent’s Process\n\n\n\n\nLate Initial Enrollment:\nAfter the 2nd week of class (fall/spring terms, different deadlines apply for summer sessions)\n\n\nStudents must fill out the Late Initial Enrollment Request Form and obtain all required signatures.\nStudents must obtain written approval from their faculty advisor.\nEmail the Late Initial Enrollment Request From and faculty advisor approval to the Graduate School at Academic Services.\n\n\n\n\nLate Course Change (Add/Change Credit/Change Section)\nAfter the 9th week of classes (fall/spring terms, different deadlines apply for summer sessions)\n\n\nFor late course adds, students must complete and submit a Late Course Add Request form.    For credit/section changes, students must complete an electronic Course Change Request in MyUW, print the form and obtain required signatures.\nStudents must obtain written approval from their faculty advisor.\nEmail the form and written approval to the Graduate School at Academic Services.\n\n\n\n\nLate Drop\nSee Registrar’s Office  Dates/Deadlines page for specific drop deadline information (fall/spring terms, different deadlines apply for summer sessions)\n\n\nStudents must fill out the Late Course Drop Form and obtain all required signatures.\nStudents must obtain written justification from their faculty advisor.\nEmail the Late Course Drop Form and written justification to the Graduate School at Academic Services.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more information about late enrollment, late course change or late drop, contact the Graduate School Office of Academic Services.\nSee Course Changes, Dean’s Approval\nLeave of Absence\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe Graduate School does not have a formal policy on leave of absence for pre-dissertators. Students should notify their graduate program of their intention to take a leave of absence.\nIf students have pre-enrolled for a future term and plan to take a leave of absence, they must be sure to drop all courses before the first day of class.\nPreviously enrolled students who wish to return to Graduate School should follow the instructions for Readmission to Graduate School. Any student who does not enroll for a fall or spring term is considered to be a reentry and must pay the Graduate School online application fee. Any student granted readmission must adhere to the most current requirements as listed in the Graduate School Academic Policies & Procedures. Master’s degree students who have been absent for five or more consecutive years lose all credits that they have earned before their absence. Doctoral degree students who have been absent for ten or more consecutive years lose all credits that they have earned before their absence. Individual programs may count the coursework students completed prior to their absence for meeting program requirements; however that coursework will not count toward Graduate School credit requirements.\nNon-dissertators: The Graduate School has no formal policy regarding a leave of absence at the pre-dissertator level, although some programs do. Therefore, it is critical that students contact their major programs before considering a break in enrollment of one or more terms.\nDissertators: A candidate for a doctoral degree should be aware that failure to take the final oral examination and submit the dissertation within 5 years after passing the preliminary examination may require another preliminary examination and admittance to candidacy a second time. In addition, the Graduate School requires all dissertators to maintain continuous enrollment. In rare circumstances when this is not possible, a degree completion fee is assessed to recognize the inevitable use of university facilities (including faculty and staff time) up to and including the successful defense of the dissertation.\nInternational Students: International students considering a leave of absence should check on their visa status with International Student Services.\nGraduate Appointments: Students with Teaching Assistantships (TA), Program Assistantships (PA), or Research Assistantships (RA) should consult with their program, their PI and/or advisor. Students with Fellowships or Traineeships should contact their funding source.\nSee Degree Completion Fee, Family Leave, International Students Maintaining Legal Status, Readmission to Graduate School (for previously enrolled graduate students), Time Limits\nMaximum Credits per Term\n\nMore\n\n\n\nNon-dissertator students are allowed to enroll for a maximum of 15 credits. The enrollment system counts all credits in determining maximum credit loads. Even though pass/fail courses, audit courses, and 100- or 200-level courses are considered undergraduate level credits, they are counted in total credit load.\nSee Enrollment Requirements\nMaximum Levels of Appointments\n\nMore\n\n\n\nUniversity policy restricts appointment levels for Project, Research, or Teaching Assistants; fellows; trainees; and university staff who are enrolled as graduate students. The levels established by the university are maximums, not minimums or expected levels.\nProject Assistant (PA) and Teaching Assistant (TA)\nAppointments exceeding 75% for domestic students are rare and require approval of the advisor and chair of the payrolling program(s), the payrolling college dean’s office(s), and the Graduate School. Some colleges, schools, or programs may set lower limits, but in general require prior specific approvals if the appointment or some combination of appointments exceeds 75%. Project Assistants may be employed 100% during summer term, semester breaks, and spring vacation. International students cannot have an appointment exceeding 50% during the spring and fall terms. International students should refer to information from International Student Services for additional appointment restrictions.\nResearch Assistant (RA)\nAppointments exceeding 50% are not permitted. Domestic students may have a combination of appointments not exceeding 75% with no more than 50% being the RA appointment. International students cannot have any combination of a RA and another appointment over 50%. International students should refer to information from International Student Services for additional appointment restrictions.\nPredoctoral Fellows/Trainees\nStudents can hold a concurrent appointment as a TA, RA, PA, or student hourly with their fellowship within the limits set out in the current university policy. Whenever assistantships (RA, TA, or PA) are combined with fellowships or traineeships, total compensation cannot exceed the full-time RA rate of the student’s academic home department, as it was reported to the Graduate School for the current year (fellowship/traineeship + assistantship = total compensation). The list of approved program rates can be found on the Graduate Assistantships webpage, under Assistantship Stipends by Program. More information about concurrent appointment policy for fellows/trainees can be found in the University of Wisconsin–Madison Policy for Supplementation and Concurrent Appointments for Graduate Students Holding Predoctoral Fellowships or Traineeships.\nLimited/Academic Staff, Non-dissertators\nCombinations of appointment percentages and academic load percentage exceeding 175% are very unusual because of the difficulty that such academic loads place on the ability of the employee to perform their responsibilities. Therefore, approval by the employing division’s dean/director (or designee) is required prior to the start of classes. The Graduate School dean should be informed in writing of any approved requests. See Chapter 11.03 of the Unclassified Personnel Policies and Procedures document for the current university policy entitled, Employees Enrolled as UW–Madison Students.\nLimited/Academic Staff, Dissertators\nCombinations of appointment percentages and academic load percentage exceeding 175% are more common because dissertators have no classes to attend. Although these are approved only at the program chair or director level, the employing unit’s dean/director (or designee) and the Dean of the Graduate School must be informed in writing of any approved requests. See Chapter 11.03 of the Unclassified Personnel Policies and Procedures document for the current university policy entitled, Employees Enrolled as UW–Madison Students.\nStudent hourly\nIn some situations it may be appropriate to hire graduate students as student hourly help. Employers should contact their Dean’s office to determine when this is appropriate. Maximum levels for appointments also include student hourly appointments. See Chapter 1.06 of the Unclassified Personnel Policies and Procedures document for the current university policy entitled, Student Hourly Help.\nFor any combination of appointments (except fellowships and traineeships), the total appointment percentage may not exceed 75%.\nA 100% academic load for graduate students is:\n\nNon-dissertators: Fall or spring terms, 8 graded credits in courses numbered 300 or above; summer sessions, 4 graded credits in courses numbered 300 or above.\nDissertators: Fall, spring, or summer, 3 graded credits numbered 300 or above.\n\nIf a student holds an assistantship concurrently with a staff appointment, the combination of appointments may not exceed 75%, regardless of the number of credits for which the student is enrolled.\nFurther information about maximum levels of appointments can be found in the University of Wisconsin–Madison Maximum Levels of Graduate Assistantship Appointments Policy\nSee Enrollment Requirements,\nMinimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe minimum graduate coursework (50%) requirement states that at least 50% of credits applied toward the program’s graduate degree credit requirement must be courses designed for graduate work (this includes but is not limited to online, thesis/research, independent study, and practicum/internship credits).  Courses taken as a University Special student are not allowed to count toward the 50% graduate coursework minimum unless taken at the 700 level or above.\nFor students taking coursework through the fall 2015 term, the official university record which identifies programs documented “graduate level” coursework is each program’s Minimum Degree Requirements and Satisfactory Progress chart in the 2014-2016 Graduate School catalog.  The official University documentation of “graduate level” coursework is identified with the graduate course attribute (G50%) in the University’s Course Guide and Class Search. More information regarding the course attribute can be found on the Academic Planning and Institutional Research (APIR) website.\nStudents should be aware that some programs may require more rigorous credit minimums than the Graduate School’s minimum. Students should visit their program’s Minimum Degree Requirements and Satisfactory Progress chart and contact their graduate program coordinator for program specific degree requirements.\nSee Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Prior Coursework, University Special Student Status, Time Limits\nMinimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe Graduate School’s minimum graduate degree credit requirement is a degree requirement instituted by the Graduate Faculty Executive Committee to ensure that a graduate degree meets institution accreditation standards (this includes but is not limited to online, thesis/research, independent study, and practicum internships credits).\nGraduate Degree Credit Minimums\nMaster’s Degree: 30 credits\n(except MFA)\nM.F.A. /Specialist Certificate: 42 credits\n(may include master’s degree credits taken at UW–Madison)\nDoctoral Degree: 51 credits\n(may include master’s degree credits taken at UW–Madison and credits take while a dissertator)\nThe doctoral degree minimum graduate degree credit requirement may be achieved with credits earned before or after dissertator status.

These credits generally are not allowed to count toward the 50% graduate coursework minimum.\nCredits applied to the minimum graduate residence credit requirement must be earned while enrolled as a graduate student at UW–Madison and can also count toward the minimum graduate degree credit requirement.\nStudents should be aware that some programs may require more rigorous credit requirements than the Graduate School’s minimum requirements. Students should contact their graduate program coordinator for further information.\nSee Dissertator Status, Grading System, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Pass/Fail, Prior Coursework, Progress (P) Grades, Time Limits, Traveling Scholar Program\nMinnesota/Wisconsin Reciprocity\n\nMore\n\n\n\nMinnesota residents who are certified by the Minnesota Office of Higher Education (MOHE) for the appropriate term/summer session to attend UW–Madison under the Minnesota-Wisconsin Tuition Reciprocity Agreement will be assessed the approved reciprocity tuition rate, plus the segregated fees assessed for all UW–Madison students. Students under this program will be classified as nonresidents of Wisconsin.\nStudents with a Research Assistantship (RA), that covers all instructional costs, will be billed as nonresidents, not Minnesota reciprocity rates. The end result to the student is the same, as students are only responsible for the segregated fees.\nStudents who are not certified for the program prior to the date fees are due must either pay nonresident rates and be refunded the difference in tuition upon certification by MOHE, or delay payment until certification is issued and include the $100.00 late payment fee due at that time.\nIt is the student’s responsibility to inquire of MOHE about the suitability of reapplying, application procedures, and deadlines. Questions and application requests should be directed to the Minnesota Office of Higher Education.\nMisconduct, Academic\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe university holds graduate students to a high standard of academic integrity and believes that misconduct may warrant university discipline in addition to sanctions imposed by an instructor. Graduate students who have been found by their instructors to commit academic misconduct can expect that the Office for Student Conduct and Community Standards will consider whether to impose a further disciplinary sanction of university probation, suspension, or expulsion.\nChapter 14 of the University of Wisconsin Administrative Code defines academic misconduct as follows:\nAcademic misconduct is an act in which a student:\n\nseeks to claim credit for the work or efforts of another without authorization or citation;\nuses unauthorized materials or fabricated data in any academic exercise;\nforges or falsifies academic documents or records;\nintentionally impedes or damages the academic work of others;\nengages in conduct aimed at making false representation of a student’s academic performance; or\nassists other students in any of these acts. UWS 14.03(1)\n\nExamples of academic misconduct include but are not limited to:\n\ncutting and pasting text from the Web without quotation marks or proper citation;\nparaphrasing from the Web without crediting the source;\nusing notes or a programmable calculator in an exam when such use is not allowed;\nusing another person’s ideas, words, or research and presenting it as one’s own by not properly crediting the originator;\nstealing examinations or course materials;\nchanging or creating data in a lab experiment;\naltering a transcript;\nsigning another person’s name to an attendance sheet;\nhiding a book knowing that another student needs it to prepare for an assignment;\ncollaboration that is contrary to the stated rules of the course; or\ntampering with a lab experiment or computer program of another student.\n\nThe full text of the state statute governing academic misconduct, University of Wisconsin System (UWS) 14, Student Academic Disciplinary Procedures, as well as the UW–campus procedures for implementing the provisions of UWS 14 and general information about academic misconduct, are available here or from the Division of Student Life.\nMisconduct, Non-Academic\n\nMore\n\n\n\nChapter 17 of the University of Wisconsin Administrative Code describes non-academic misconduct as follows:\nThe university may discipline a student in non-academic matters in the following situations:\n\nfor conduct which constitutes a serious danger to the personal safety of a member of the university community or guest;\nfor stalking or harassment;\nfor conduct that seriously damages or destroys university property or attempts to damage or destroy university property, or the property of a member of the university community or guest;\nfor conduct that obstructs or seriously impairs university-run or university-authorized activities, or that interferes with or impedes the ability of a member of the university community, or guest, to participate in university-run or university-authorized activities;\nfor unauthorized possession of university property or property of another member of the university community or guest;\nfor acts which violate the provisions of UWS 18, Conduct on University Lands;\nfor knowingly making a false statement to any university employee or agent on a university-related matter, or for refusing to identify oneself to such employee or agent;\nfor violating a standard of conduct, or other requirement or restriction imposed in connection with disciplinary action.\n\nExamples of non-academic misconduct include but are not limited to:\n\nengaging in conduct that is a crime involving danger to property or persons, as defined in UWS 18.06(22)(d);\nattacking or otherwise physically abusing, threatening to physically injure, or physically intimidating a member of the university community or a guest;\nattacking or throwing rocks or other dangerous objects at law enforcement personnel, or inciting others to do so;\nselling or delivering a controlled substance, as defined in 161 Wis. Stats., or possessing a controlled substance with intent to sell or deliver;\nremoving, tampering with, or otherwise rendering useless university equipment or property intended for use in preserving or protecting the safety of members of the university community, such as fire alarms, fire extinguisher, fire exit signs, first aid equipment, or emergency telephones; or obstructing fire escape routes;\npreventing or blocking physical entry to or exit from a university building, corridor, or room;\nengaging in shouted interruptions, whistling, or similar means of interfering with a classroom presentation or a university-sponsored speech or program;\nobstructing a university officer or employee engaged in the lawful performance of duties;\nobstructing or interfering with a student engaged in attending classes or participating in university-run or university-authorized activities;\nknowingly disrupting access to university computing resources or misusing university computing resources.\n\nThe full text of the state statute governing non-academic misconduct, UWS 17, Student Non-Academic Misconduct Disciplinary Procedures, as well as the UW campus procedures for implementing the provisions of UWS 17 and general information about non-academic misconduct, are available here or from the Division of Student Life.\nNo Report (NR) Grades\n\nMore\n\n\n\nA No Report (NR) grade on a student’s record indicates that the instructor for the course has not yet submitted a final grade for the student’s work at the end of the grading period. This grade is not the same as an Incomplete (I), which indicates that the student’s work was unfinished at the end of the term.\nAll grades for 790, 890, 990 that are unreported (previously assigned an NR) by the end of the grading period will be automatically assigned a P (Progress). The P grades will automatically revert to S grades upon assignment of the grade for the final semester of enrollment in the course. If the instructors had intended a different grade (S, U, or I), they would need to use the electronic grade change process.\nSee Grading System, Incomplete Grades, Progress (P) Grades, Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) Grades\nOverloads\n\nMore\n\n\n\nStudents are allowed to enroll for a maximum of 15 credits during fall and spring. Summer maximum enrollment is 12 credits. Credits included are those courses numbered 300 or above, taken for a grade (not including audits and pass/fail).\nDissertators are not eligible for overloads in the fall or spring terms. However, in the summer, a dissertator who is enrolled in the general 8-week session for 3 credits may request an overload for 1-2 additional credits in a short session and still retain dissertator status.  For such requests to be approved, the course must be related to dissertation research or professional training that is not offered in regular semesters. Faculty advisors can request an overload exception for summer from the Graduate School Degree Coordinator.\nThe enrollment system counts all credits in determining maximum credit loads. An overload request is required if a student wishes to exceed the maximum number of credits they are allowed as a graduate student. Even though pass/fail courses, audit courses, and 100- or 200-level courses are not considered graduate level credits, they are counted in a total credit load. An overload request is also required if the number of credits exceeds the span of weeks in any short session during the summer (but not for a dissertator).\nIf a student wishes to enroll for more than the maximum credit load, they must submit a Credit Overload Request form, signed by their advisor, to the Graduate School Office of Academic Services. The Graduate School will look closely at the rationale for the request, the student’s course load, satisfactory progress, and assistantships. Overloads to 16-17 credits during the fall and spring semesters are generally allowed. Overloads to 18 credits are only approved for fall/spring if some of the credits are taken in a short term prior to or during the semester  If the Graduate School approves the overload, the student will then be allowed to add the course.\nSee Enrollment Requirements, Maximum Levels of Appointments\nPass/Fail Courses\n\nMore\n\n\n\nPass/fail courses do not satisfy any Graduate School credit, coursework, or degree requirements, nor do they fulfill minimum or maximum credits required each term. Tuition is still charged for pass/fail course. For these reasons, very few graduate students choose pass/fail for courses numbered 300 or above. Seminars, independent study, and research may not be taken pass/fail. The pass/fail option is not to be confused with the S/U grading option.\nStudents requesting to enroll in a course as pass/fail must first enroll or be enrolled in the course.  The request is made via the MyUW Student Center by submitting an online Course Change Request, changing the course to pass/fail. After the student requests this change online via MyUW Student Center, they submit the pass/fail form to the Graduate School either electronically at gsacserv@grad.wisc.edu or in person in room 217 Bascom Hall where it is reviewed and approved by the Graduate School.  The deadline to request/cancel pass/fail is the drop deadline, which is the end of the 9th week of class during the fall and spring semester. Requests for late pass/fail will not be considered. Specific deadline dates, including those for summer sessions, are posted prior to each semester by the Office of the Registrar.\nThe instructor does not know that a student is taking the course on a pass/fail basis and therefore reports a letter grade for the course. The Registrar records a grade of S in place of the instructors’ grades of A, AB, B, BC, or C; and a grade of U in place of D or F grades. Neither the S nor the U are computed in the graduate grade-point average.\nThe enrollment system counts all credits in determining maximum credit loads. A Credit Overload Request is required if a student’s total credit load exceeds the maximum limit per term.\nSee Dean’s Approval, Enrollment Requirements, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Overloads, Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) Grades\nPayroll Benefits for Graduate Assistants, Fellows, and Trainees\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFellow\nTrainee\nResearch Assistant\nProject Assistant\nTeaching Assistant\n\n\n\n\nSubject to State and Federal Income Taxes\nyes1\nyes1\nyes\nyes\nyes\n\n\nWithholding\nno2\nno2\nyes\nyes\nyes\n\n\nSubject to FICA Tax\nno\nno\nno3\nno3\nno3\n\n\nW2\nno4\nno4\nyes\nyes\nyes\n\n\nHealth Insurance (if at least 33% time appointment or an equivalent*)\nyes\nyes\nyes\nyes\nyes\n\n\nRemission of nonresident portion of tuition (if at least 33% time appointment or an equivalent*)\nyes\nno\nyes, unless student is enrolled in a service-based pricing program5\nyes, unless student is enrolled in a service-based pricing program5\nyes, unless student is enrolled in a service-based pricing program5\n\n\nRemission of resident portion of tuition (if at least 33% time appointment or an equivalent*)\nno\nno\nyes6, unless student is enrolled in a service-based pricing program5\nyes6, unless student is enrolled in a service-based pricing program5\nyes6, unless student is enrolled in a service-based pricing program5\n\n\nVacation\nno\nvaries\nyes\nyes\nno\n\n\nSick Leave\nno\nvaries\nyes\nyes\nyes\n\n\n\n1 May deduct tuition, fees, and books from stipends when calculating taxable income.\n2 Except international students.

The instructor of the course or their advisor submits a grade change request with an explanation or reason, changing the grade from I to PI. The Office of the Registrar also converts any incomplete grade over 5 years old to PI. Students may graduate with PI’s on their transcript.\nSee Incomplete Grades\nPortal (MyGradPortal)\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe Graduate Portal is an online resource for students and graduate coordinators. Students use the Portal to complete academic actions such as adding or changing their major, discovering professional development opportunities, and submitting payment for the completion of their doctoral degrees. Graduate Coordinators request degree warrants (master’s, preliminary exams, and doctoral) through the Portal.  Students should spend time becoming familiar with the Portal and its features.\nAccessing MyUW and the Graduate Student Portal\n\nGo to wisc.edu and open your MyUW in the top red banner. Then click on MyUW Home.\nEnter your NetID login information.\nClick on the tile “Graduate Student Portal”. If you do not see the tile, you can search for it in the top search bar and add it to your page.\n\nInitiating a request in the Portal\n\nOnce in your Portal page, select the tile on the home page titled “Add/Change Programs.”\nIn the “Enrolled Programs” section, you will have options to add a Graduate/Professional certificate, doctoral minor (PhD students only), or major. You also have the option to discontinue a program in which you are already enrolled.\n\nChoosing an action button will display an associated window, which will show fields appropriate for the type of request.\nPreliminary Examinations\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe preliminary examination is a significant milestone in a doctoral student’s academic career. It is given to assess knowledge of areas within the academic discipline. Passing of the preliminary area exam, obtaining approval of the minor if the major program requires it, and completing all the major course requirements culminate in admission to candidacy for the doctoral degree.\nStudents’ eligibility to take the prelim examination(s) is determined by their program. The program notifies the Graduate School of a student’s admission to candidacy on the preliminary warrant, which must be requested 3 weeks prior to the exam date. The number of examinations and their content vary from program to program. A student’s program administers the examination(s).\nAfter passing the preliminary examination, students have 5 years to take the final examination (i.e. dissertation defense) and deposit their dissertation. The 5-year clock starts on the first day of instruction of the term (Fall, Spring, or Summer) immediately following the completion of the preliminary examination. Failure to complete their degree within this period may result in students having to retake the preliminary examination and be re-admitted to candidacy.\nTime limit extension for dissertators impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic\nTo offer flexibility amidst the major disruption that COVID-19 may have had on doctoral candidates’ research and scholarship progress, students who achieved dissertator status by the end of the 2020 summer term have automatically had the 5-year time limit extended by 8 months. Dissertators given this 8-month extension who need more time due to continued COVID-related disruption to their progress may request a further extension from the Graduate School. Decisions to extend the deadline beyond the additional 8 months are made on a case-by-case basis upon request of the student and approval of their advisor. Upon advisor approval, the advisor then requests an extension from the Graduate School by submitting the request to the PhD degree coordinator at gsacserv@grad.wisc.edu.\nSee Certificate of Doctoral Candidacy, Dissertator Status, Time Limits, Warrants\nPrior Coursework\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe Graduate School does not transfer credits for previous coursework.  However, a student’s program may decide to accept coursework completed outside of the student’s graduate career at UW–Madison under the conditions detailed below.  Any prior coursework accepted under these parameters must have been rigorous and meet the expectations of a graduate work for the degree. Coursework earned five or more years prior to admission to a master’s degree or coursework earned ten or more years prior to admission to a doctoral degree is not allowed to satisfy requirements.\nSatisfying Requirements with Prior Graduate Coursework from Other Institutions\nA student’s program may decide to accept graduate coursework completed at another institution (earned post-baccalaureate) toward fulfillment of minimum degree, minimum graduate coursework, and minor credit requirements. This work will not appear on a UW–Madison transcript nor count towards the graduate career GPA. The Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence credit requirement can be satisfied only with courses taken as a graduate student at UW–Madison. The only exception is graduate-level coursework taken as a Big Ten Academic Alliance Traveling Scholar.\nSatisfying Requirements with Coursework from Undergraduate Career at UW–Madison\nFor well-prepared advanced students, a student’s program may decide to accept up to seven credits numbered 300 or above of required or elective courses from the undergraduate work completed at UW–Madison towards fulfillment of minimum degree and minor credit requirements. However, this work would not be allowed to count toward the 50% graduate coursework minimum unless taken at the 700 level or above. This work will not appear on the graduate career portion of UW–Madison transcript nor count towards the graduate career GPA. The Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence credit requirement can be satisfied only with courses taken as a graduate student at UW–Madison.\nSatisfying Requirements with Coursework from Undergraduate Career outside of UW-Madison (Policy on Exceptions for Specialized Accreditation to Allow Undergraduate Credits Towards a Graduate Degree) \nWhen considering the undergraduate category of prior coursework, the Graduate Faculty Executive Committee (GFEC) restricts the seven credits of undergraduate work to UW-Madison courses because of the challenges associated with assessing the rigor of courses taught at other institutions.\nAccredited programs may request an exception to this policy to allow up to seven credits of undergraduate coursework from other institutions to count toward a graduate degree based on specialized accreditation.  The process for requesting an exception was approved by the GFEC in 2014 and is as follows in italics:\nAn exception to allow up to seven credits from an undergraduate degree earned at a non UW- Madison institution to count toward a UW-Madison graduate degree can be requested on a program-by-program basis when the following two conditions are met:\n1) students have received their undergraduate degree in the same discipline as they are pursuing graduate work, and \n2) the undergraduate degree has been granted from a program which is accredited by the same accrediting body as the UW-Madison program.\nShould a program decide to request an exception to this policy, it must provide the Graduate School with information requested on the undergraduate credit exception form to be eligible for consideration. Please note submission of an exception request does not provide assurance of its approval.\nIf a program believes a student situation meets these criteria, it must request this exception by completing the steps as outlined in the undergraduate credit exception form.  A request may be made at any time, but please note that the earliest date for implementation is the term AFTER Graduate School approval.  Please direct any questions to Emily Reynolds at emily.reynolds@wisc.edu.\nTransfer from University Special Student Career at UW–Madison\nAfter admission to a graduate program, the student’s program may decide to accept up to fifteen University Special student credits as fulfillment of the minimum graduate residence, graduate degree, or minor credit requirements on occasion as an exception (on a case-by-case basis). In all these cases, the student would have to pay the difference in tuition for the terms in question. Those credits earned in a University Special student semester still appear in the transcript history as “University Special” student, but the Registrar’s Office will add a statement in the beginning of the transcript “All credits taken in [term] as a University Special student have been accepted by the Graduate School toward a degree program” after the student has paid the difference in tuition. UW–Madison coursework taken as a University Special student would not be allowed to count toward the 50% graduate coursework minimum unless taken at the 700 level or above. This work will not appear on the graduate career portion of the UW–Madison transcript nor count towards the graduate career GPA.\n\n\n\n\n**Prior Graduate Coursework from Other Institution(s)\n** Coursework from Undergraduate Career at UW–Madison (up to 7 credits total)\n**Transfer from University Special Student Career at UW–Madison (up to 15 credits total)\n\n\nMinimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement\nNo\nNo\n*Allowed up to 15 credits numbered 300 or above\n\n\nMinimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement\n*Allowed\n*Allowed up to 7 credits numbered 300 or above\n *Allowed up to 15 credits numbered 300 or above\n\n\nMinimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement\n*Allowed\n*Allowed up to 7 credits numbered 700 or above\n*Allowed up to 15 credits numbered 700 or above\n\n\n\n*Fulfillment of requirements is allowed in these instances only if approved by the student’s graduate program.\n**Coursework earned five or more years prior to admission to a master’s degree or coursework earned ten or more years prior to admission to a doctoral degree is not allowed to satisfy requirements.\nPrograms may decide to count previous graduate work from another institute toward fulfillment of degree credit requirements; however, this work will not appear on a UW–Madison transcript, and it does not count toward the Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence credit or graduate coursework (50%) requirements.\nPrior coursework can be used toward the minor requirement in accordance with the Prior Coursework policy chart.\nThe credits used towards a master’s degree and the prior coursework used toward it may also be applied to a related doctoral degree. However, if the prior coursework credit maximums were already reached for the master’s degree (seven UW–Madison undergraduate credits and/or fifteen University Special student credits), then no more prior coursework credits are permissible for the doctoral degree.\nStudents should be aware that some programs may require more rigorous credit requirements than the Graduate School’s minimum requirements. Students should contact their graduate program coordinator for further information.\nSee Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement\nProbation\n\nMore\n\n\n\nStudents must be in good academic standing with the Graduate School, their program, and their advisor. The Graduate School regularly reviews the record of any student who received grades of BC, C, D, F, or I in courses numbered 300 or above, or grades of U in research and thesis. This review could result in academic probation with a hold on future enrollment, and the student may be suspended from graduate studies.\nThe Graduate School requires that students maintain a minimum graduate GPA of 3.00 in courses taken as a graduate student (excluding research, audit, credit/no credit, and pass/fail courses). The Graduate School also considers Incomplete (I) grades to be unsatisfactory if they are not removed during the subsequent semester of enrollment; however, the instructor may impose an earlier deadline. The Graduate School may also put students on probation for incompletes not cleared within one term. All incomplete grades must be resolved before a degree is granted.\nIf students were admitted on probation and they satisfy the conditions outlined at the time of admission, probationary status will be removed automatically. Once their studies have begun, students are expected to make satisfactory progress toward their degree.\nSee Grade Point Average (GPA) Requirement, Holds, Incompletes, Satisfactory Progress, Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) Grades\nPrograms (or ‘Majors’)\n\nMore\n\n\n\nPrograms are officially approved courses of study and research leading to a master’s or doctoral degree. They may be administered from within a disciplinary department or across departments by an interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary cluster of faculty. Some programs have official areas of concentration within them (called Named Options or Subplans) at the master’s and/or doctoral levels. Both programs and named options appear on the student’s transcript. Some programs have unofficial tracks, specializations, or concentrations but these are not listed on the transcript. Contact the program’s graduate coordinator for more information.\nStudents who would like to pursue an individual program different from approved programs should see Special Graduate Committee Degrees.\nSee Applying to Add/Change Program, Plan, Certificate or Named Option, Change of Degree Level (Plan) or Degree Named Option (Sub-Major), Doctoral Minors, Special Graduate Committee Degrees\nProgress (P) Grades\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe P is an abbreviation for “Progress,” not an abbreviation for “Pass.” It is a temporary grade. Grades of P (except for research and thesis within the program) must be changed before a degree or preliminary exam warrant can be issued.\nIf a P is assigned for research courses numbered 790, 890, and 990, the grade will remain until the faculty member assigns a grade of S or U. All previously assigned P grades in that instructor’s research course will revert to an S or U upon assignment of the S or U grade. Usually this is upon assignment of the final grade for the course in the semester of submitting the dissertation. (All grades for 790, 890, 990 that are unreported by the end of the grading period will be automatically assigned a P.)\nSee Grading System, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, No Report (NR) Grades\nProject or Program Assistant (PA)\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThese titles designate graduate or professional students employed to assist with research, training, or other academic programs or projects. Contact the employing department directly for more information.\nThe Graduate Assistant Policies and Procedures (GAPP) outline employment-related practices for graduate student project assistants.\nSee Concurrent Appointments for Fellows/Trainees, Enrollment Requirements, Maximum Levels of Appointments, Tuition Remission, Payroll Benefits for Graduate Assistants, Fellows, and Trainees\nQualifying Examination\n\nMore\n\n\n\nQualifying examination requirements differ for each program. Students should contact their program to learn about specific requirements.\nSee Preliminary Examinations\nReadmission to Graduate School (for previously enrolled graduate students)\n\nMore\n\n\n\nIf graduate students do not continuously enroll during a fall or spring semester, they are required to apply for readmission to the Graduate School through the online application. The readmission process accomplishes two goals: (1) assures the Graduate School that graduate students are in good standing with their academic program; and (2) activates their enrollment eligibility. Further information about readmission for previously enrolled graduate students can be found here. To apply for readmission, graduate students must also contact their program for further details of the readmission process at the program level.\nA returning student who is completing another same level degree within five years must comply with double degree requirements, including the 25% overlap rule.\nAny student being readmitted to a graduate program must adhere to the requirements in the most current Academic Policies & Procedures and Graduate Guide.\nSee Double Degrees, Effective Dates, International Students Maintaining Legal Status, Leave of Absence, Time Limits\nRepeating Courses\n\nMore\n\n\n\nTypically, courses where content can change (such as special topics, seminars, independent studies, and research and thesis) can be repeated within the semester or on a semester basis. Repeated courses may earn course credit and satisfy the Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence, degree, and coursework (50%) credit requirements. Sometimes program authorization is necessary for enrollment.\nStudents are entitled to repeat any didactic course if they or their program feel it is necessary. Both grades will be used in calculating the student’s graduate grade-point average; however, the course will count only once toward the Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence, degree, and coursework (50%) credit requirements.\nSee Failure, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Satisfactory Progress, Appendix 4 – Grade-Point Average Calculation\nResearch Assistant (RA)\n\nMore\n\n\n\nA Research Assistant (RA) must be a graduate student working toward a master’s or doctoral degree. Research Assistants are UW–Madison graduate students who are given stipends to support their own education and training. RAs should not be given work assignments unrelated to their own educational pursuits – graduate assistants with significant duties unrelated to their own course of study should be appointed as a PA rather than an RA.\nThe program will give consideration for an RA appointment based on information provided in the application for admission or, in some cases, in a specific program application form. Research Assistants will receive a letter of appointment or reappointment each semester or year they hold their assistantship. If appointed students have not received such a letter, they should contact their payrolling office.\nNote that the RA appointment percentage is merely a mechanism for setting the stipend amount, and does not correlate to any particular requirement for hours of work. The maximum appointment percentage is 50%. However, to account for the potential that RAs may occasionally perform duties that are not directly related to their course of study, the university has deemed an RA appointment to entail 5 hours of compensated employment per week. In no event may an RA be asked to perform more than 5 hours per week of work unrelated to their course of study, regardless of percentage of RA appointment.\nThe Graduate Assistant Policies and Procedures (GAPP) outline employment-related practices for graduate student research assistants.\nSee Enrollment Requirements, Maximum Levels of Appointments\nResidence for Tuition Purposes\n\nMore\n\n\n\nWisconsin Statute 36.27(2) governs resident status for tuition purposes. To be eligible for in-state tuition, a student must be a bona fide resident of Wisconsin for at least the 12 months immediately prior to enrollment, or must qualify as a resident for tuition purposes under one of the provisions in the Statutes that waives the 12-month requirement. In determining resident status for tuition purposes, standards are different from those used for voting, paying taxes, etc.\nIf students are classified as nonresident for tuition purposes, they do not automatically become residents for tuition purposes after residing in Wisconsin for one or more years. In cases where it appears the students have entered and remained in Wisconsin principally for educational purposes, a presumption is made that they continue to reside outside the state. The presumption of non-residence continues in effect until rebutted by clear and convincing evidence of bona fide residence.\nProvisions of the statute under which a student may qualify as a resident for tuition purposes without waiting 12 months are:\n\nThe student is a graduate of a Wisconsin high school and has a parent who has been a bona fide resident of Wisconsin for the 12 months preceding the beginning of any term of enrollment or whose last surviving parent was a bona fide resident of this state for the 12 months preceding death;\nThe student, a spouse, or parent (of which they are claimed as a tax dependent), has moved to Wisconsin for a job transfer or for new employment that was accepted before moving and before the student applied to this university. The employment needs to continue full-time with the same employer, and the student needs to demonstrate an intent to establish and maintain their permanent home in Wisconsin;\nOne of the student’s parents is a bona fide resident of Wisconsin, and the student is a tax dependent of one of the parents.\n\nFind more information about residence for tuition purposes and the full text of the applicable statute on the Office of the Registrar’s Residence for Tuition Purposes webpage. Students with questions about residence for tuition purposes, or who believe they should be a resident and would like to appeal the nonresident tuition status, may contact the Office of the Registrar’s Residence Counselors.\nResponsible Conduct of Research\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe various areas of responsible conduct of research and associated policies are described below. For more information, see this comprehensive document regarding UW–Madison Research Safety and Compliance Training Requirements and the Research Policy and Compliance Checklist.\nAnimal Care and Use in Research\nUW–Madison has federal compliance responsibilities that pertain to the use of live, vertebrate animals in research, teaching, and outreach activities. This includes but is not limited to traditional basic and applied research models, instruction of students, and public events. Oversight and evaluation of the humane and ethical use of animals is performed by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUCs). The Research Animal Resource Center (RARC) provides support to the IACUCs and training to animal users necessary to provide the highest quality care and compliance for the university’s research animals. Learn more about the rules and regulations governing the care and use of research animals, how to prepare and submit animal care and use protocols to IACUCs, and how to obtain veterinary and pathology services at the Research Animal Resources Center webpage. Training and protocol approval are required before one can begin research projects involving animals.\nAuthorship\nAuthors of a research publication are usually those who provide meaningful intellectual contribution to a project in one or more of the following ways: concept, design, supervision, resources, materials, data collection and processing, analysis or interpretation, literature search and writing. Many academic journals may list very specific requirements for authorship. All authors have rights and responsibilities thus any person listed as an author should be knowledgeable and aware of such. Unless the contributions of the co-authors are listed, each author takes full responsibility for the contents of the work. When asked to serve as a publication reviewer, students should treat this material as confidential. See further information about authorship, publication and peer review.\nConflict of Interest\nThe Conflict of Interest (COI) staff and committee review reports of outside activities and financial interests to comply with federal, state, and university regulations and policies. This committee also works with faculty and staff to eliminate, minimize, or manage any actual or potential financial conflicts of interest identified by the reporting process. For further information see the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research’s Conflict of Interest guidance document and Outside Activities Reporting webpage.\nHuman Research Protections\nIn accordance with federal regulations and UW–Madison policies, all research involving human subjects must be reviewed and approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) prior to any research intervention with participants. All graduate research involving human subjects for inclusion in a master’s thesis or doctoral dissertation must be approved by an IRB before beginning the research. Training is required before a project is submitted to an IRB for review. For additional information, see the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research Human Research Protection Program webpage. For additional information visit the Institutional Review Board webpage.\nIntellectual Property Rights\nExcept as required by funding agreements or other university policies, the university does not claim ownership rights in the intellectual property generated during research by its faculty, staff, or students. This policy has proven beneficial to the university, the public, and the creators of such property. In the case of inventions funded in whole or in part by a federal agency or in the case of sponsored research agreements that require the university to grant rights in inventions generated by funding under such agreements, faculty, staff, and students must assign rights to such invention to the university’s designated patent management organization, the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF). Faculty, staff, and students must execute all papers necessary to file patent applications on the invention and establish the federal government’s or other sponsor’s rights in the invention. If there are no specific written agreements or policies to the contrary, the researcher at the university is free to dispose of the rights in the manner of his or her own choosing. The university retains the right to use the products of research conducted as a university activity for its education and research mission. See information and forms for disclosing an invention or read more about intellectual property.\nMisconduct of Research\nGraduate education is carried in classrooms, laboratories and other research venues, and is often supported by federal or other external funding sources. Maintaining the integrity of academic and research efforts carried out at UW–Madison is an essential priority. At UW–Madison, graduate students are held to the same standards of responsible conduct of research as faculty and staff. Misconduct in scholarly research is defined as fabrication (making up data), falsification (changing or misreporting data), plagiarism (representing work of others as your own), or other practices that seriously deviate from those that are commonly accepted within the scholarly community for proposing, conducting, or reporting research. For more information, see the overview of Misconduct in Scholarly Research and Faculty Legislation II-314: Misconduct in Scholarly Research. The Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research is responsible for investigating allegations of research misconduct. For more information, contact the Associate Vice Chancellor for Research Policy and Integrity.\nReporting Wrongdoing, Non-compliance or Research Misconduct\nThe University of Wisconsin-Madison strives to foster the highest scholarly and ethical standards among its students, faculty, and staff. As a recipient of federal funding, the University of Wisconsin must comply with federal laws related to civil rights, animal welfare research misconduct, and others. Though extremely rare, we realize there are times when reportable events of wrongdoing, noncompliance, or misconduct may occur in our midst and that it is our responsibility as an academic community to take steps to rectify them. See the Whistleblower Protection Policy and the policy on Obligations and Protections for Graduate Students.\nPatents\nA patent is an exclusive statutory right available to the inventor or inventors of new material. As inventors, students may have the right to seek patent protection for their invention (for example, for a product that results from the research documented in their dissertation).\nIf students have received support (for example, an appointment as a Research Assistant or Project Assistant) for the work leading to an invention, or used any other university funding, supplies, equipment, or university premises, in the work leading to an invention, they may have obligations that affect their rights to seek patent protection for an invention. It is important to discuss patents with their advisor. Also, students should review the Intellectual Property Policy for Research.\nResearch Regulatory Compliance\nIf students’ research involves human subjects (including data sets, surveys, human blood, or other body materials), live animals, recombinant DNA, infectious agents, stem cells, or biological toxins, they should consult the Research Ethics webpage.\nSafety\nBiological Safety\nThe Office of Biological Safety (OBS) assists faculty, students, and staff in observing safe practices in research in the biological sciences as prescribed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and endeavors to ensure that research is done in secure facilities in compliance with all local, state, and federal regulations. As an institution receiving NIH research funds, UW–Madison is subject to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules (rDNA). OBS provides the administrative mechanism by which research involving rDNA can be reviewed, thereby assuring compliance with the NIH guidelines. This institution adheres to the guidance of the CDC/NIH publication, Biosafety in Biomedical and Microbiological Laboratories. Institutional policies are described in the UW–Madison Researchers’ Biosafety Manual.\nChemical Safety\nThe UW–Madison Chemical Safety Office, working in conjunction with the campus Chemical Safety Committee, establishes policies and procedures for the safe acquisition, use, storage, and disposal of chemicals on campus. The Chemical Safety Office also advises campus chemical users on best practices and helps the university community comply with federal, state, and local chemical and environmental safety laws. See the Office of Chemical Safety website for additional information.\nRadiation Safety\nThe UW–Madison Office of Radiation Safety provides training on the safe use and handling of radioactive materials, which includes ordering, use, disposal, spill cleanup, and shipping for those employees who will need to ship radioactive materials. The Office of Radiation Safety also provides shielding assessments and dosimetry to those users who require it. Additionally, training on safe use of x-ray generating equipment and lasers is also available. See the Office of Radiation Safety website for additional information.\nSatisfactory Academic Progress\n\nMore\n\n\n\nContinuation in the Graduate School is at the discretion of a student’s program, the Graduate School, and a student’s faculty advisor.  A student may be placed on probation or dismissed from the Graduate School for not maintaining satisfactory academic progress.  In special cases the Graduate School permits students who do not meet these minimum standards to continue on probation upon recommendation and support of their advisor.\nThe Graduate School sets minimum standards that all graduate students in the university must meet. Many departments and programs have additional requirements that exceed these Graduate School minimum requirements. The definition of satisfactory progress varies by program.\nMost programs require satisfactory progress to continue guaranteed funding support.\nThe Graduate Guide includes the Graduate School’s minimum degree requirements and satisfactory progress chart, as well as each program’s minimum degree requirements and satisfactory progress chart.\nIn determining satisfactory academic progress, the Graduate School monitors the following: cumulative grade point average, incomplete grades, English as a second language for some international students, the grades of students admitted on probationary status, enrollment in minimum required credits (underload), and unsatisfactory (U) grades.  Detailed information for each is below.\nLow cumulative GPA\nGraduate students must meet the Graduate School’s minimum 3.0 cumulative GPA in order to graduate. Some probationary admission conditions may require higher grades. When a graduate student’s cumulative GPA drops below a 3.0 for one semester, we notify them via email (copy to grad coordinator) that they are placed on academic probation, and we place a GSD LGR enrollment hold on the following semester. They cannot continue enrolling until the probationary semester’s grades are reported and their cumulative GPA is above a 3.0.\nIf a student is placed on probation due to low GPA, they receive an email notification with the graduate coordinator copied.\nIncomplete (I) grades\nIf graduate students have not resolved incompletes by the end of the subsequent semester of enrollment, these grades are considered unsatisfactory. Graduate students are not permitted to graduate with incomplete grades on their record. The Graduate School issues warnings for incompletes that have not yet lapsed into bad standing, and for three or less credits of incompletes. The Graduate School places student on academic probation for having more than three credits of incompletes in bad standing and uses the GSD INC service indicator (enrollment hold) to ensure that this requirement is met before continued enrollment is permitted.\nIf a student is placed on probation due to incompletes, he/she receives an email notification with the graduate coordinator copied.\nESL required at admission to the Graduate School\nInternational graduate students may be required to take the ESLAT upon arrival at UW-Madison. This requirement applies to the following test scores: TOEFL (paper-based) test score is below 580; TOEFL computer based test (CBT) score below 237; (TOEFL internet based iBT) test score below 92; IELTS score below 7; or MELAB below 82. The ESLAT is administered by the English as a Second Language Program (Sandy Arfa, Director). ESLAT results may indicate that a graduate student is exempt from taking an ESL course, or these results may indicate a recommended ESL course. Graduate students for whom the ESLAT was required and who are not exempt based on the test results must enroll in the recommended ESL course during their first semester at UW-Madison. The Graduate School monitors successful completion of the ESL course for these students. The GSD ESL service indicator (enrollment hold) ensures that this requirement is met before continued enrollment is permitted.\nAdmit on probation\nApplicants who do not meet Graduate School admissions requirements may be admitted on probation, with program recommendation and GS Dean’s approval. They are admitted as G17 or G18 (probationary admit) codes, and receive an admission letter from the Graduate School, as well as message in OASIS, that notifies them they are being admitted on probation. These cases are monitored closely to ensure that the students achieve a 3.0 GPA during their first semester of enrollment. A hold is placed (GSD ADT), which prohibits them from enrolling in the following semester classes until their first semester grades are reported and the GPA is above a 3.0.\nUnderload (1 credit)\nGraduate students are required to enroll in a minimum of 2 graded, graduate-level credits each fall and spring semester. Those who are enrolled in only 1 credit each fall and spring semester are notified by the GS that they are under-enrolled. They are required to correct their enrollment immediately, and a GSD UNL hold is placed on their record, prohibiting them from enrolling in the subsequent term, until they meet the minimum enrollment requirement.\nUnsatisfactory (U) grades\nIf a course has been structured to offer the S/U grading option (such as research), a grade of S in that course would mean a grade of B or better. The Graduate School monitors U grades. Since these grades are very rare, cases are handled individually. Upon identification of a graduate student with a U grade in research, we contact the faculty advisor to find out more about the situation. GSD LGR holds are not automatically placed for U grades but may be if necessary.\n \n \nSee Grade Point Average (GPA) Requirement, Incompletes, Probation\nSatisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) Grades\n\nMore\n\n\n\nFor all courses listed as research, the only permissible grades are Satisfactory (S), Unsatisfactory (U), and Progress (P). Though an Incomplete (I) grade may be assigned, a final grade must be submitted during the following term. If a P grade is assigned, it will remain until the instructor assigns a grade of S or U; all previously assigned P grades should revert to an S or U upon assignment of the final grade in most cases. These courses will not count in the student’s graduate Grade Point Average (GPA).\nResearch courses are traditionally reserved for graduate students; however, other students (Law, Medical, Undergraduate, etc.) occasionally register for a research course. In these cases the student’s college can decide to have the course count in the GPA with an academic action to the Registrar’s Office.\nIf a course has been structured to offer the S/U grading option, a grade of S in that course would mean a grade of B or better. S/U courses are not computed into the grade-point average. They may however satisfy the Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence, degree, and coursework (50%) credit requirements as well as the minor course credit and in considering the minimum or maximum credit load per term. The S/U grading option is not to be confused with the pass/fail option. Unsatisfactory grades do not satisfy any Graduate School’s minimum credit requirements. Programs and the Graduate School monitor students for unsatisfactory grades. Advisor holds may be placed for students with unsatisfactory grades.\nThe use of letter grades (A through F) is encouraged and recommended whenever information on performance permits. Courses designated as research require grading on the S/U basis. In certain seminars and advanced topics courses, where lack of examinations and other performance criteria makes the A-F scale inappropriate, use of the S/U option is permissible.\nSee Grade Point Average (GPA) Requirement, Incompletes, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Pass/Fail, Probation, Progress (P) Grades\nSchedule of Classes\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe Schedule of Classes is available on the Course Search and Enroll App, and students can access the Schedule of Classes via their MyUW Student Center. The Schedule of Classes can be viewed using class search, the real-time online listing of course sections offered each term. Students are responsible for complying with enrollment deadlines, available at the Office of the Registrar’s Enrollment Deadlines.\nSee Authorization for Courses, Enrollment Accountability\nSchools and Colleges, Graduate Degrees\n\nMore\n\n\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin–Madison Schools and Colleges\nCollege of Agricultural and Life Sciences\nWisconsin School of Business\nSchool of Education\nCollege of Engineering\nGraduate School\nSchool of Human Ecology\nLaw School\nCollege of Letters and Science\nSchool of Medicine and Public Health\nSchool of Nursing\nNelson Institute for Environmental Studies\nSchool of Pharmacy\nSchool of Veterinary Medicine\nDegrees Granted by the University of Wisconsin–Madison Graduate School\nMaster of Accountancy (MAcc)\nMaster of Arts (MA)\nMaster of Business Administration (MBA)\nMaster of Engineering (MEng)\nMaster of Fine Arts (MFA)\nMaster of French Studies (MFS)\nMaster of International Public Affairs (MIPA)\nMaster of Music (MM)\nMaster of Public Affairs (MPA)\nMaster of Science (MS)\nMaster of Social Work (MSW)\nEducational Specialist in School Psychology (EdS)\nDoctor of Audiology (AuD)\nDoctor of Musical Arts (DMA)\nDoctor of Nursing Practice (DNP)\nDoctor of Occupational Therapy (OTD)\nDoctor of Philosophy (PhD)\nFor a list of programs and degrees offered by each department, see UW–Madison Graduate Academic Programs. Also see the current Graduate Guide.\nUW–Madison offers a number of post-baccalaureate professional degrees that are not administered by the Graduate School, but instead are solely supported by their home school. See Other Professional Degrees.\nSection Changes\n\nMore\n\n\n\nSection changes include: changes in Lectures, Discussions, Labs and Instructors’ course numbers for research or independent study courses for which students are already enrolled. Always consult the Office of the Registrar for deadlines and procedures for section changes.\nIf a student’s name does not appear on the appropriate instructor’s grade roster at the end of the term, a Course Change Request to change sections and a letter of request from the instructor of the class must be submitted to the Graduate School Office of Academic Services. The instructor of the correct section must submit a Grade Change Form to assign a grade. The instructor of the incorrect section should submit no grade.\nSee Course Changes, Grade Change\nSexual Harassment\n\nMore\n\n\n\nUW–Madison prohibits sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking. These offenses violate UW–Madison policies and are subject to disciplinary action. Sanctions can range from reprimand to expulsion from UW–Madison. In many cases, these offenses also violate Wisconsin criminal law and could lead to arrest and criminal prosecution.\nStudents who experience sexual harassment, sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and/or stalking have many options and services available to them on and off campus, including mental health counseling, victim advocacy and access to the criminal and campus disciplinary systems. For a list a confidential support and reporting options, please visit University Health Services.\nAll students are encouraged to report harassment of any kind, whether it is by a faculty or staff member or another student. Students may contact the Office of Student Assistance and Support: visit 70 Bascom Hall, email OSAS@studentaffairs.wisc.edu, call 608-263-5700 and ask to speak to the Dean on Call, or fill out a Bias Incident Reporting Form.\nFaculty, staff, teaching assistants, and others who work directly with students at UW–Madison are required by law to report first-hand knowledge or disclosures of sexual assault to university officials for statistical purposes. In addition, disclosures made to certain university employees, such as academic advisors or university administrators, may be forwarded to the campus Title IX coordinator for a response. For more information, visit the Office of Student Assistance and Support’s Sexual Assault, Dating and Domestic Violence webpage.\nGraduate students are expected to complete an online violence prevention program. Read more about the violence prevention program for graduate students.\nSee Grievances and Appeals\nSpecial Graduate Committee Degrees\n\nMore\n\n\n\nSpecial graduate committee degrees are one-of-a-kind degrees built around unique needs of individual students that cannot be satisfied by approved programs (e.g., by existing major program/minor combinations, joint degrees, distributed minors, etc.) and may permit individual degrees in new and emerging fields or combinations of disciplines. A higher degree of independence is required on the part of the student, since easily available guidance provided by programs is often more difficult to obtain, and there is not the usual collegial group of students in closely related research and coursework.\nThe master’s and doctoral special graduate committee guidelines are:\n\nProspective students who may have an interest in a special graduate committee degree should apply to the degree program that is closest to their program interest.\nUpon receipt of an application on which a prospective student has expressed interest in a special graduate committee degree, the program will follow all relevant program admission requirements.\nStudents may not be admitted directly to a special graduate committee degree program. They must be accepted for admission by an established department or program and be attending classes at UW–Madison before a proposal for a special graduate committee degree will be considered by the Graduate School.\nThe department or program admitting the student must be prepared to see the student through an established degree program. No commitments are made to provide a special graduate committee degree until after the student is enrolled and the proposal for the special degree and the student’s ability at the graduate level have been evaluated and approved.\nThe student’s advisor authors and submits the special graduate committee degree proposal on behalf of the student as early in the student’s program as possible. Proposals submitted after a substantial portion of the program has been completed will not be accepted. Doctoral proposals must be submitted by the end of the first year of graduate work. Master’s proposals must be submitted after the equivalent of the first full-time semester of graduate work. The proposal should consist of the following elements:\n\nThe reasons the special graduate committee program is needed and an explanation of why the student’s needs cannot be met within existing programs.\nThe exact title of the proposed degree program (which should be brief and descriptive).\nThe proposed course and seminar program of graduate work on this campus. Include the course title, program, course number, credits, grade, and semester taken/to be taken.\nAny specific requirements of the dissertation or thesis (language, equipment, etc.).\nThe nature and scope of preliminary examinations for the doctoral degree, or the examination procedure for the master’s degree.\nThe nature of the dissertation or thesis (general subject area).\nThe names of the faculty members who, in addition to the advisor, are willing to share the responsibility of supervising the student’s program. Including the advisor, the doctoral degree requires 4 members (including 3 UW–Madison graduate faculty members), and the master’s degree requires 3 members (including 2 UW–Madison graduate faculty members). Approval signatures of the committee members are required on the proposal.\n\n\nThe Graduate School will carefully review proposals to determine whether or not the program can be carried out within an established department or program, joint degrees, appropriate use of minors, or other available mechanisms. The suitability and degree of commitment of the committee for the proposed program will be examined.\nThe chairperson of the committee (usually the advisor) should be a member of the program to which the student originally had been admitted. That program should remain the keeper of the student’s records and should make all appropriate nominations for financial aid.\nThe Graduate School is concerned about maintaining active participation by all members of special degree committees in the ongoing program of the student and asks the individual members of the committee to assume program responsibilities provided institutionally in a conventional program. Faculty members who are willing to serve on these committees should be prepared to participate fully in all aspects of the student’s program from the beginning, especially where they must provide the necessary expertise in their particular areas of interest.\n\nSee Committees (Doctoral/Master’s)\nSpecialist Certificates (For students in ELPA or LIS programs)\n\nMore\n\n\n\nStudents can earn a Specialist Certificate in Educational Leadership and Policy Analysis or a Specialist Certificate in Library and Information Studies. The Specialist Certificate represents work beyond the master’s level. In addition to program requirements, the Graduate School requires that the student must meet all Graduate School minimum degree and satisfactory progress requirements as listed in the Graduate School’s Minimum Degree Requirements and Satisfactory Progress chart in the Graduate Guide.\nFor additional information, contact the programs that offer the Specialist Certificates.\nSee Enrollment Requirements, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Transfer Credits for Prior Coursework, Time Limits\nStudy Abroad\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe university creates an international context for education by providing opportunities for UW–Madison students to study overseas. Because of the variety of programs, students should coordinate their study abroad program with their graduate program, the Graduate School, and International Academic Programs (IAP).\nStudents intending to study abroad through a UW–Madison approved study abroad program can learn more about their options through International Academic Programs.\nGraduate students who are interested in conducting research abroad can register for IAP’s UW Graduate Research, which allows students to stay continuously registered as UW–Madison students, receive research credit with their faculty advisor, international health insurance, and 24/7 emergency assistance through IAP. This is an individualized experience and is not tied to a specific study abroad program. Students will need to have a high degree of independence in arranging housing and logistics for themselves.\nAll graduate students traveling abroad are encouraged to acquire insurance through Cultural Insurance Services International.\nSee Fellowships, Insurance and Medical Benefits\nTeaching Assistant (TA)\n\nMore\n\n\n\nMany programs offer Teaching Assistantships. This title is appropriate for graduate students who have been assigned teaching responsibilities in an instructional program under the supervision of a faculty member of the academic staff. Contact the employing program directly for more information about the TA position.\nThe Graduate Assistant Policies and Procedures (GAPP) outline employment-related practices for graduate student teaching assistants.\nSee Enrollment Requirements, Maximum Levels of Appointments, Teaching Assistant (TA) Orientation and Training, Tuition Remission, Payroll Benefits for Graduate Assistants, Fellows, and Trainees\nThesis (Masters)\n\nMore\n\n\n\nSome master’s degrees require a thesis to be deposited in the Memorial Library. The Graduate School produces materials that describe the preparation of a thesis. See the Graduate School’s guide to Completing Your Master’s Degree.\nSee Dissertation and Thesis Standards and Publishing\nTime Limits\n\nMore\n\n\n\nGraduate degrees are awarded, in part, for completion of current coursework. Students who break enrollment from their graduate program may risk losing all credits earned prior to their absence.\nMaster’s degree: students who have been absent for five or more consecutive years lose all credits that they have earned before their absence.\nDoctoral degree: students who have been absent for ten or more consecutive years lose all credits that they have earned before their absence.\nIndividual programs may count the coursework students completed prior to their absence for meeting program requirements; however that coursework will not count toward Graduate School credit requirements. Although the program may count the coursework students did before their absence towards the program requirements, the Graduate School does not count that work toward the Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence, degree, and coursework (50%) credit requirements.\nA candidate for a doctoral degree who fails to take the final oral examination and deposit the dissertation within 5 years after passing the preliminary examination may be required to take another preliminary examination and to be admitted to candidacy a second time.\nA student’s program may appeal these time limits through a written request to the Graduate School Degree Coordinator. The appeal must provide information demonstrating that the student has remained current in the field of study. This information may include a resume showing applicable work experience and/or official transcripts from other schools attended.\nSee Effective Dates, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Preliminary Examinations, Readmission to Graduate School (for previously enrolled graduate students)\nTransfer of Graduate Work from Other Institutions\n\nMore\n\n\n\nUnder the Prior Coursework policy, a student’s program may decide to accept graduate coursework completed outside of the students graduate career at UW–Madison when those courses are rigorous and meet the expectations of a graduate work for the degree. Students should contact their program when inquiring about or attempting to transfer graduate work from other institutions. Coursework earned five or more years prior to admission to a master’s degree or coursework earned ten or more years prior to admission to a doctoral degree is not allowed to satisfy Graduate School minimum credit requirements. See the Satisfying Requirements with Prior Graduate Coursework from Other Institution(s) section of the Prior Coursework policy.\nSee Dean’s Approval, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Prior Coursework\nTraveling Scholar Program\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe Big Ten Academic Alliance sponsors the Traveling Scholar Program as part of a continuing effort to increase cooperative use of its member institutions’ resources. This program enables doctoral-level students at any Big Ten Academic Alliance university to take advantage of educational opportunities (specialized courses, unique library collections, unusual laboratories) at any other Big Ten Academic Alliance university without additional tuition expenses. Find a list of member universities.\nCredits earned by Traveling Scholars are transferred by the home university upon receipt of transcript from the host university. Courses and grades are posted directly on a student’s UW–Madison transcript and, if graduate level, count toward the Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence, degree, and coursework credit requirements. Terms are limited to two semesters or three quarters regardless of the number of courses taken.\nStudents interested in the Traveling Scholars Program should contact the Graduate School Degree Coordinator for an application or more information.\nSee Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Transfer Credits for Prior Coursework\nTuition and Fee Information\n\nMore\n\n\n\nStudents go to their MyUW Student Center Tuition Account Summary to view their tuition charges, payments, financial aid, loans, scholarships and refunds; and to access links to set up an “Authorized Payer” and view, print, and pay eBills.\nThe tuition bill is provided as an eBill which is published to view, print, or pay online on the Tuition Account eBill/ePayment secure website. An email is sent to notify students and their Authorized Payers each time a new eBill is published. If students want their parents to have access to the website, students must first set them up as Authorized Payers. Detailed Authorized Payer information is available on the Bursar’s Office How to Add an Authorized Payer webpage.\nTuition and fee charges must be paid by the due date indicated on the tuition and fee statement to avoid a $100 late fee. (Late fee is subject to change.) UW–Madison does not accept debit or credit cards for tuition payment. Detailed payment options and information are available on the Bursar’s Office Payment Methods webpage. For tuition account questions or more information, contact the Bursar’s Office at: tuition@bussvc.wisc.edu (include the student name/ID in the email), or by phone: 608-262-3611.\nThe date a course is dropped or the date a student submits an online withdrawal request determines eligibility for a tuition adjustment. For tuition and fee adjustment and assessment questions, visit the Bursar’s Office Tuition Adjustment webpage or contact them at tuition@bussvc.wisc.edu. Find class drop deadlines, cost adjustments, tuition refund schedules plus other tuition and fees information on the Office of the Registrar’s Dates & Deadlines webpage.\nSee Tuition Remission, Withdrawal\nTuition Remission\n\nMore\n\n\n\nMost graduate students who have a Project Assistantship (PA), a Teaching Assistantship (TA), or a Research Assistantship (RA) of at least a 33% appointment for a fall or spring term are eligible to receive remission of full tuition.\nGraduate students enrolled in service-based pricing programs, such as online and accelerated programs, are ineligible to receive tuition remission. See a list of UW–Madison academic programs with service-based pricing (NetID login required).\nGraduate students should consult with their graduate programs and read their admission and appointment letters carefully to understand their benefits eligibility.\nFellowships that are payrolled through the university and carry stipends equivalent to at least a 33% Research Assistantship also qualify for remission of non-resident tuition.\nStudents should check with the payroll coordinator in their program to determine eligibility.\nAll graduate assistants are responsible for paying their segregated fees.\nTuition is remitted in summer sessions to graduate students in one of the following categories:\n\nThose continuing students who were granted remissions in the immediately-preceding Spring semester provided they held a teaching, research, or project assistantship (all tuition), or graduate fellowship (non-resident portion of tuition) and enroll in the summer session as graduate students;\nThose students who hold research, teaching, or project assistantship appointments, or fellowship appointments for the summer sessions, and who meet the criteria for remission established for the summer session.\n\nFor more information, visit the Bursar’s Office Tuition Remission webpage or view the Bursar’s Tuition Remissions Policy. For questions, contact the Bursar’s Office at remissions@bussvc.wisc.edu.\nSee Enrollment Requirements, Fellowships, Minnesota/Wisconsin Reciprocity, Project or Program Assistant (PA), Research Assistant (RA), Teaching Assistant (TA), Traineeships, Withdrawal, Payroll Benefits for Graduate Assistants, Fellows, and Trainees\nUniversity Special Student Status\n\nMore\n\n\n\nStudents enrolled as University Special students are considered non-degree candidates and pay tuition and fees at the designated special student rate. See the Transfer Credits for Prior Coursework policy for information on how limited credits taken as a University Special Student may be accepted by a graduate program. Students are not allowed to simultaneously enroll as a graduate student and as a University Special student.\nBefore beginning a graduate program, an international student may choose to study full-time English as a University Special student on an F-1 visa granted through the ESL program or on a J-1 visa with the sponsor’s approval. When the student begins a graduate program, the student’s status will be changed from University Special student to graduate student.\nFor more information visit the Adult Career and Special Student Services website or contact them at advising@dcs.wisc.edu.\nVariable Credit Courses\n\nMore\n\n\n\nSome didactic courses are offered to both undergraduate and graduate students. Typically undergraduate students enroll for a higher amount of total credits than do graduate students. Courses of this nature are designated in the Schedule of Classes as variable credit courses. Students should consult the Course Search and Enroll App to determine the appropriate credits when enrolling for a variable credit course.\nViolence Prevention\n\nMore\n\n\n\nUniversity Health Services (UHS) has designed an online sexual violence prevention training program specifically for graduate students to promote the health and safety of the campus community by increasing understanding of sexual assault, harassment, dating and domestic violence, and stalking, as well as prevention strategies, resources, victim rights, and reporting options. Starting fall 2017, all new incoming graduate students, admitted summer 2017 or after, are required to complete the 45-minute online training program within their first semester. Failure to complete the training will result in probation and a registration hold.\nFor further information, review the Task Force on Sexual Violence and Harassment recommendations document, which was adopted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents in 2016. For questions, visit the violence prevention program website or email violenceprevention@uhs.wisc.edu.\nWarrants\n\nMore\n\n\n\nA warrant is a program’s recommendation that a student be admitted to doctoral candidacy (a preliminary examination warrant) or be granted a degree (master’s or doctoral degree warrant).  Warrants are requested electronically by the Graduate Program Coordinator.  Once reviewed and approved by the Graduate School Degree Coordinator, the warrant serves as the Graduate School’s notification that a student has met both the Graduate School and program requirements with the exception for  degrees requiring a thesis/dissertation defense or final oral exam/exhibit. Approved warrants for doctoral degrees and master’s degrees requiring a thesis/dissertation defense or final oral exam/exhibit are made available to committee members for signature after evaluating the thesis/dissertation or final oral exam/exhibit.   If the committee decides the student has met this final requirement, the warrant is returned to the Graduate School for final review before the degree is approved (cleared) and awarded (posted).\nSee Certificate of Doctoral Candidacy, Dissertator Status, Dissertation Defense (Final Examination), Preliminary Examinations\nWithdrawal\n\nMore\n\n\n\nWithdrawal indicates that a student intends to stop attending classes for the current semester. Submission of a withdrawal request in MyUW Student Center is required between the first and last day of the semester, when a student wishes to drop all classes in which they are enrolled for the current semester. Requests are then routed electronically to the Graduate School for review. Approval from the Graduate School, as well as from the Office of International Student Services for students on J-1 and F-1 visas, is required before a graduate student is formally withdrawn from the semester. For more information visit the Office of the Registrar’s Withdraw or Cancel Enrollment for a Term webpage.\nIf students drop all courses before the first day of classes, they officially cancel their enrollment, owe no tuition or fees for that term, and have no semester entry on their transcript. In this case, it is not necessary for the student to submit a withdrawal request to the Graduate School. Students planning to withdraw from their academic program should contact their program directly.\nStudents are considered enrolled for a term if they have courses on their record on or after the first day of classes for that term regardless of whether they have paid tuition and fees. Failure to attend classes or leaving the university informally does not excuse a student from having to pay tuition and fees. If students withdraw after the transcript deadline, a notation with the date of withdrawal will appear on the transcript. Enrollment deadlines are posted by the Office of the Registrar on their Enrollment Deadlines webpage.\nFailure to withdraw properly and promptly can be expensive. Before withdrawing, students should consult the Office of the Registrar’s Enrollment Deadlines webpage for specific deadlines and refund dates. If a student received financial aid from the university, they should consult the Office of Student Financial Aid to determine repayment responsibilities. If students withdraw and are receiving remission of tuition, they are responsible for their entire tuition assessment.\nSee Tuition and Fee Information, Tuition Remission\n[GRID_TABLE]\nAdd/Drop\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is a student’s responsibility to be aware of the add/drop deadlines each term. Consult the Office of the Registrar’s website for essential enrollment information and important deadlines. Courses may be added, dropped, or swapped through MyUW Student Center before and during the first two weeks of a semester (or the first week in the general 8-week summer session).\nIf a student drops a course, swaps out of a course, decreases credits in a variable credit course (via the “edit” function), or withdraws from the university, tuition and fee refunds are dispensed following a strict refund schedule. Modular courses and summer session courses have a shorter refund period.\nInternational students are not allowed to drop below full-time enrollment unless they have first received authorization from International Student Services (ISS). This will ensure that they remain in compliance with Department of Homeland Security (DHS) visa regulations. International students holding graduate assistantships, fellowships, and traineeships must meet minimum enrollment requirements. A reduced course load from ISS does not exempt graduate students holding assistantships, fellowships, and traineeships from these minimum enrollment requirements.\nIf students enroll for a course and do not attend, they must drop the class or receive a grade of NW (No Work) or, for audited classes, NR (No Report). If students make a course change after the fee refund deadlines (including audited, modular, and zero-credit courses), they may be charged a fee even if the total number of credits for which they are enrolled does not change. The Bursar’s Office will notify students if they owe additional fees or are entitled to a refund.\nStudents should be aware that “swap” is a drop action combined with an add action, allowing them to swap from one section to another section within the same course, or swap one course for another course. Some cautions related to swapping courses:\n\nBecause swap is a DROP and an ADD, the refund and assessment schedules and the dropped (DR) grade notation on the transcript deadline dates apply.\nAll session add/drop deadlines follow the Office of the Registrar’s Enrollment Deadlines.\nClass eligibility controls and prerequisites will be adhered to. If the class is closed or a student is not eligible for that class, the swap will NOT occur.\n\nFor more information and questions, contact the Office of the Registrar or Graduate School Office of Academic Services.

An advisor—sometimes referred to as the major professor, mentor, or trainer—generally serves as chair of a student’s final examination committee.\nThe advisor/student relationship is one of mutual agreement, which may be terminated by either party. If a student changes advisors, they need to notify their program coordinator. It is the responsibility of every graduate student to have an advisor. If students do not have an advisor, the Graduate School may suspend them from further graduate study at UW–Madison until they find an advisor. However, in some cases, particularly for incoming students, the program may assign an advisor.\nWith approval from the program, students can have a co-advisor/co-chair. The co-advisor/co-chair may be from any of the following categories: graduate faculty, faculty from a department without a graduate program, academic staff (including emeritus faculty), visiting faculty, faculty from another institution, scientists, research associates, and other individuals deemed qualified by the program executive committee or its equivalent. Effective September 1, 2017, the co-advisor/co-chair will be designated on dissertation documentation.\nSee Committees (Doctoral/Master’s)\nAn advisor is a faculty member from the program responsible for providing advice regarding graduate studies and for supervising a student’s degree program (including research).

Effective September 1, 2017, the co-advisor/co-chair will be designated on dissertation documentation.\nSee Committees (Doctoral/Master’s)\nApplying to Add/Change Program, Plan, Certificate or Named Option\n\nMore\n\n\n\nCurrently enrolled graduate students who want to apply to add, change, or discontinue a program of study, or add a certificate, do so through the Graduate Student Portal (in the MyGradPortal in MyUW).  An admissions application and fee are not required.\nStudents must check with the intended program concerning admission requirements (for example, letters of recommendation or statement of purpose) and eligibility. Upon receipt of a recommendation from the program, the Graduate School will notify the student of the decision. Note: Changing programs between a service based pricing program and a pooled program during a term are not allowed, so students should always indicate the next academic term when requesting to change between these types of programs. Adding minors, certificates, or discontinuing a program is allowed during a term. Questions regarding the status of an application are best directed to the program.\nIf dissertators want to add a program, typically a master’s program or a certificate program, they cannot concurrently hold dissertator fee status while pursuing the graduate degree or certificate. Dissertators who add a program or a certificate program will be removed from dissertator status and must enroll and pay fees as a regular graduate student.\nInternational students who add/change a program or a certificate program should contact International Student Services to discuss the possible effects this change of program could have on immigration status.\nSteps to Add/Change Program, Plan, or Named Option\nAccess MyUW and the Graduate Student Portal:\n\nGo to my.wisc.edu.\nEnter your NetID login information.\nClick on the tile “Graduate Student Portal”. If you do not see the tile, you can search for it in the top search bar and add it to your page.\n\nInitiating a request:\n\nOnce in your Portal page, select the tile on the home page titled “Add/Change Programs.”\nIn the “Enrolled Programs” section, you will have options to add a Graduate/Professional certificate, doctoral minor (PhD students only), or major. You also have the option to discontinue a program in which you are already enrolled.\nChoose an action button, which will display an associated window and show fields appropriate for the type of request.\nFill out the fields and click the “send” button to complete the initial request.\n\nThe request will show up as “In Review” in the Requests section on the Add/Change Programs page. Your Graduate Program Coordinator will follow up once your request is decided. More detailed instructions on this process, including example screenshots, can be found in the Add/Change/Discontinue Program Training.\nSee Change of Degree Level (Plan), Change of Degree Named Option, Dissertator Status, Named Option, Programs (or ‘Majors’)\nAssistantships\n\nMore\n\n\n\nDepartments/programs determine eligibility for most Teaching Assistantships (TAs), Research Assistantships (RAs), and Project/Program Assistantships (PAs). Other possible university appointments include fellowships, traineeships, reader/grader, and student hourly positions. Students should contact their program for information on how to obtain an assistantship.\nMore information can be found in the Payroll Benefits appendix.\nThe Graduate Assistant Policies and Procedures (GAPP) outline employment-related practices for graduate student teaching, research, and project assistants.\nSee Enrollment Requirements, Fellowships, Maximum Levels of Appointments, Project or Program Assistant (PA), Research Assistant (RA), Teaching Assistant (TA), Traineeships\nAttendance\n\nMore\n\n\n\nStudents should not attend classes without being enrolled. Faculty and instructors may require enrolled students to attend scheduled meetings of a class and/or to participate in other course-related activities, including online learning. Students are responsible for materials presented in such meetings or activities. Because courses are designed and conducted in diverse ways, faculty and instructors should inform students in writing at the beginning of each course if there are specific expectations for attendance/participation, including whether any component of the grade is based on such attendance/participation.\nSee Religious and Election Day Observances Policy and Guidelines in the Academic Calendar for more information.\nAuditing Courses\n\nMore\n\n\n\nA student auditing a course is expected to attend classes on a regular basis as an observer. Audits are not free; a course taken for audit costs the same as a course taken for credit. If students are not paying full-time fees, they will be assessed per-credit fees for an audit course. Auditors do not take examinations or submit class work. Auditors will receive a final grade of either S (Satisfactory) or NR (No Report). Audit courses do not satisfy any credit, coursework, or degree requirements, nor do they count in fulfilling minimum or maximum credits required in each term. Students holding assistantships and fellowships should be particularly aware of the enrollment requirement for their appointment, as audit requests will be denied if auditing the course would drop them below the required number of graded credits.  If students audit a course and do not attend or drop it, they will receive a grade of NR (No Report). Dissertators are not allowed to audit.  Dissertators who wish to audit a course will be removed from dissertator fee status and assessed regular graduate student fees and also will need to enroll in the appropriate number of graded credits (see enrollment requirements). Students who have research assistantship, fellowship or traineeship appointments are required to be enrolled full-time; audited courses do not count toward full-time enrollment.\nInstructors may limit the number of auditors in a course and may restrict participation of auditors in courses inappropriate for that function. For example, courses that by their nature require participation (seminars, research, laboratory, performance, or language courses) are typically considered inappropriate for auditing.  Additionally, independent study courses are not appropriate for auditing.\nTo audit a course, a student must first obtain the consent of the instructor. The student must follow the procedures established in the program offering the course. Graduate School Dean’s approval is required for all course changes, including audit; see the Course Changes section of this document for instructions. The Dean’s signature will be fulfilled once submitted to the Graduate School. The deadline to request/cancel permission to audit is the drop deadline, which is the end of the 9th week of class during the fall and spring semester. Requests for late audits will not be considered. Specific deadline dates, including those for summer sessions, are posted prior to each semester by the Office of the Registrar.\nThe enrollment system counts all credits in determining maximum credit loads. A Credit Overload Request from is required if a student’s total credit load exceeds the maximum limit per term.\nSee Authorization for Courses, Course Changes, Credit Changes, Dean’s Approval, Dissertator Status, Enrollment Requirements, Overloads, Refunds\nAuthorization for Courses\n\nMore\n\n\n\nEnrollment authorization may be required for certain courses and/or situations, such as:\n\nauditing courses\npermission to take a course when a student does not meet course controls or prerequisites, or\npermission to enroll in a closed course\n\nOnce authorized by the program offering the course, students then may enroll in the course.\nSee Add/Drop, Auditing Courses, Credit Changes, Pass/Fail\nBenefits\n\nMore\n\n\n\nProject/Program Assistants (PAs), Research Assistants (RAs), and Teaching Assistants (TAs), fellows, and trainees who hold at least a 33% appointment (or an equivalent) may be eligible for health insurance, vacation, sick leave, and remission of tuition. Students should contact their department/program staff benefits coordinator for details.\nGraduate students enrolled in service-based pricing programs, such as online and accelerated programs, are ineligible to receive tuition remission. See a list of UW–Madison academic programs with service-based pricing (NetID login required).\nSee Enrollment Requirements, Insurance and Medical Benefits, Tuition Remission, Payroll Benefits\nBreadth Requirements in Doctoral Education\n\nMore\n\n\n\nBreadth is a required component of doctoral training at UW–Madison. Given there are multiple paths to breadth, the Graduate School leaves the choice of whether students achieve breadth through a minor or other means up to the specific program.\nSee Minors\nCanceling Enrollment\n\nMore\n\n\n\nBefore the first day of classes (Canceling Enrollment)\nIf students do not wish to attend a semester and drop all courses before the first day of classes, they officially cancel their enrollment, owe no tuition or fees for that term, and have no semester entry on their transcript. In this case, it is not necessary for the student to submit a withdrawal request through MyUW.\nOn or after the first day of classes (Withdrawing)\nOn or after the first day of class, students who no longer wish to remain enrolled need to submit an electronic withdrawal request via MyUW Student Center. More information about canceling enrollment or withdrawal requests can be found on the Registrar’s website.\nSee Withdrawal\nCapstone Certificates\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe university offers capstone certificates for students not currently enrolled in a UW–Madison graduate degree program. Applicants must have completed a baccalaureate degree or equivalent credential from an accredited college or university. The capstone certificate is designed to ‘cap off’ undergraduate experience or to offer a focused professionally oriented experience. Capstone programs do not lead to the conferral of a graduate degree. Further information about capstone certificates can be found on the Professional Degrees & Certificates website.\nSee Graduate/Professional Certificates, Specialist Certificates\nCertificate of Doctoral Candidacy\n\nMore\n\n\n\nDissertators who do not plan on finishing their degree may request a Certificate of Doctoral Candidacy in recognition of their completion of all requirements toward the doctoral degree except for the dissertation (sometimes called all but dissertation/ABD at other institutions). The certificate shows the date of the preliminary examination as well as the issue date, but does not substitute for an official transcript from the Office of the Registrar. To obtain the certificate, students, advisors, or graduate coordinators should contact the Graduate School Degree Coordinator.\nSee Dissertator Status\nCertification of Enrollment Status\n\nMore\n\n\n\nFor purposes of certification to government or private agencies, the Office of the Registrar determines enrollment status as full-time or part-time according to institutional policies, which may differ from full-time or part-time requirements imposed by individual schools or programs. Certification of official enrollment for loan deferment, medical and auto insurance forms, and credit card applications can be obtained by going to the Office of the Registrar’s verifications webpage.\nVeterans Certification: Student Veterans who are eligible for Federal and State Educational Benefits should apply for certification of enrollment at University Veteran Services. Students receiving veterans’ benefits are required to promptly report any credit change or withdrawal from school to University Veteran Services.\nSee Enrollment Requirements\nCertification of Graduation (or ‘Degree Completion Letter’)\n\nMore\n\n\n\nIf you have completed all degree requirements and deposited your thesis or dissertation and are waiting until the next degree conferral date to receive your degree, you may request from the Office of the Registrar a Degree Completion Letter (Degree Verification) indicating that all requirements have been completed. Important: All grades from the semester in which you are depositing your dissertation (and all other outstanding grades) must be reported before you can receive a completion letter.\nSince master’s and doctoral degrees do not appear on transcripts until 4 to 6 weeks after the end of a semester, students may wish to obtain this letter from the Registrar’s Office to provide to employers or other universities to verify degree completion before the transcript posting, but after all grades are finalized and their dissertation (doctoral degree) or thesis (if required for the master’s degree) is approved and deposited.\nSee Degree Conferral/Payroll End Dates, Holds\nChange of Degree Level (Plan) or Degree Named Option (Sub-Major)\n\nMore\n\n\n\nDegree Level (Plan)\nA student may change their degree level, for example, if students with a master’s degree plan have completed their master’s degree and want to continue in the same program for the doctoral degree. To change degree level, see Applying to Add/Change Program, Plan, or Named Option.\nNamed Option (Sub-Major)\nA named option is a formally documented sub-major within an academic major program. Named options appear on the transcript with degree conferral. The Graduate Faculty Executive Committee approves official named options. Many programs may also have unofficial specializations, concentrations, or tracks; unlike named options these do not appear on the transcript. Find more information on named options. To report a change in degree named option, see Applying to Add/Change Program, Plan, or Named Option.\nFor questions, please contact the Graduate School Degree Coordinator.\nSee Applying to Add/Change Program, Plan, or Named Option, Programs (or ‘Majors’)\nCommittees (Doctoral/Master’s/MFA)\n\nMore\n\n\n\nCommittees advise and evaluate satisfactory progress, administer preliminary and final oral examinations, evaluate a thesis or dissertation, and/or sign a degree warrant. A student’s program arranges a committee with appropriate expertise to afford the breadth and depth needed in degree examinations. The responsibilities of individual committee members are determined by the program. The executive committee (or its equivalent) of a program/department is responsible for approving the composition of all graduate committees. The final warrant request which includes committee membership must be submitted to the Graduate School at least three weeks before the examination date. Students should consult their advisor and their program’s student handbook for the specific function of degree committees in their program.\nUse this online tool to help you determine whether the proposed committee would meet the following criteria.\nTHE GRADUATE SCHOOL REQUIREMENTS FOR GRADUATE COMMITTEES ARE AS FOLLOWS:\nFor doctoral committees/final oral examination committees:\n1.

They may be administered from within a disciplinary department or across departments by an interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary cluster of faculty. Some programs have official areas of concentration within them (called named options or subplans) at the master’s and/or doctoral levels. Both programs and named options appear on the student’s transcript. Some programs have unofficial tracks, specializations, or concentrations, but these are not listed on the transcript. Contact the program’s graduate coordinator for more information.\n4 The advisor does not have to be chair of the committee, although it is often the case. Moreover, the co-advisors/co-chairs will be designated in the dissertation document.\n5 Note that affiliate appointments may be used to satisfy this requirement.\n6 Readers: Committee members who commit themselves to closely reading and reviewing the entire dissertation. The rationale for specifically designating non-reader status is to facilitate faculty participation in dissertations without automatically expecting the level of commitment associated with deeply engaging a PhD thesis. Given faculty workloads, designating a non-reader in some cases may permit faculty participation where engagement would otherwise be impossible. As long as the Graduate School minimum of at least three committee members that are readers is upheld, programs will remain in compliance with Graduate School policy. Programs may choose to have stricter requirements.\nSee Advisor\nCompassionate Tuition Adjustment\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe Graduate School supports the principles of a compassionate tuition adjustment to accommodate students who withdraw in the following circumstance:\n\nThe students have experienced an unexpected life circumstance and/or traumatic event for which they have little or no control, and\nIt appears that the event will impede/prevent the students from successfully completing the semester.\n\nThe dean or the dean’s designee will assess the meaning and effect of the event on the student and the request for tuition adjustment. Students requesting a tuition adjustment should submit their request in writing to Academic Services in the Graduate School, along with written support for the request from the student’s faculty advisor and/or graduate program chair. Relevant documentation may be required.\nSee Dean’s Approval\nConcurrent Appointments for Fellows/Trainees\n\nMore\n\n\n\nConcurrent appointments describes a situation where a graduate student holds multiple appointments as a fellow, trainee, and/or graduate assistant. Federal agencies and non-federal donors often place restrictions on the amount of work in which an awardee may engage, or on additional stipends an awardee may receive. In addition, the university has a concurrent appointment policy that places limits on multiple appointments for fellows or trainees.\nWhenever assistantships (RA, TA, or PA) are combined with fellowships or traineeships, total compensation cannot exceed the department’s full-time RA rate that was reported to the Graduate School for the current year (fellowship/traineeship + assistantship = total compensation). The list of approved program rates can be found on the Graduate Assistantships webpage, under “Assistantship stipends by program”.\nThe concurrent appointment policy for fellows/trainees can be found here in the University of Wisconsin-Madison Policy for Supplementation and Concurrent Appointments for Graduate Students Holding Predoctoral Fellowships or Traineeships.\nSee Maximum Levels of Appointments\nContinuous Enrollment Requirement for Dissertators\n\nMore\n\n\n\nOnce students achieve dissertator status they must maintain continuous enrollment until completion of the doctoral degree. In order to maintain continuous enrollment, dissertators must enroll each fall and spring semester for 3 credits (300 or above) directly related to their dissertation research (generally research and thesis and/or required seminars). In some cases, the 3 credits can be a combination of research and a seminar. Fall and spring enrollment are required whether or not they reside in Madison.\nAudits and pass/fail do not satisfy this requirement. Additional courses taken audit or pass/fail will result in removal of dissertator fee status.\nStudents are exempt from the requirement to enroll for the summer term, unless they are defending and/or depositing their dissertation or have a Research Assistantship (RA), fellowship, or traineeship that requires summer enrollment, or are using university facilities (including faculty and staff time).\nIf dissertators do not maintain continuous enrollment, they will be assessed a degree completion fee equal to 12 times the current per-credit rate in effect at the time that they submit their dissertation to the Graduate School for final review.\nSee Degree Completion Fee, Dissertator Status, Enrollment Requirements, Readmission to Graduate School (for previously enrolled graduate students)\nCourse Changes\n\nMore\n\n\n\nPrior to making changes to courses, be sure to review the Office of the Registrar’s Enrollment Deadlines Page for important dates and deadlines, and the Graduate School’s Enrollment Requirements including important information about minimum credits required.\nPrior to deadlines, students may make course changes online via MyUW Student Center. See the Late Enrollment/Late Course Change/Late Drop document for changing enrollment after the deadlines.\nIf a course change is made after the fee refund deadlines (including audited, modular, and zero-credit courses) students may owe additional money, even if the total number of credits for which they are enrolled does not change. The Bursar’s Office will notify students if they owe additional fees or are entitled to a refund.\nStudents holding graduate assistantships, fellowships, and traineeships must meet minimum enrollment requirements when making course changes.\nInternational students considering a course change that may drop them to part-time status must first receive authorization from International Student Services (ISS). This will ensure that they remain in compliance with Department of Homeland Security (DHS) visa regulations. International students holding graduate assistantships, fellowships, and traineeships must meet minimum enrollment requirements as well.\nFor more information and questions, contact the Office of the Registrar or Graduate School Academic Services. The Registrar’s Office also offers demos and tutorials for course enrollment. For instructions on how to late add/change/drop a class, visit the Late Enrollment/Late Course Change/Late Drop document.\nSee Add/Drop, Auditing Courses, Authorization for Courses, Credit Changes, Enrollment Requirements, Late Enrollment/Late Course Change/Late Drop, Section Changes, Tuition and Fee Information\nCourse Numbering System\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe number assigned to a course gives an indication of for whom the course is intended. While graduate students can enroll in courses numbered under 300, those courses do not count for any credits toward a graduate degree or for minimum enrollment requirements.\nThe Minimum Graduate Coursework Policy requires at least 50% of a graduate degree coursework be taken with courses that have the graduate level course attribute. See the Course Attributes Policy for specific information on courses that meet this requirement.\nSee also Continuous Enrollment Requirement, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Prior Coursework\nCredit Changes\n\nMore\n\n\n\nStudents are not allowed to enroll for more or fewer credits than indicated for a course in the Schedule of Classes.\nFor more information and questions, contact the Office of the Registrar or Graduate School Office of Academic Services. Demos & Tutorials for course changes are available here. For instructions on how to late add/change/drop a class, visit the Late Enrollment/Late Course Change/Late Drop section.\nSee Auditing Courses, Course Changes, Dean’s Approval, Late Enrollment/Late Course Change/Late Drop, Pass/Fail, Variable Credit Courses, Tuition and Fee Information\nCredit/No Credit Grades\n\nMore\n\n\n\nCourses that have been designated in the Schedule of Classes as credit/no credit are entered on transcripts as either CR, if students earned credits for which the course was offered, or N, if students did not earn any credit, even though they were enrolled for the course. Any course numbered 300 or above that is taken for credit/no credit will count toward the Graduate School’s minimum graduate degree credit requirement and the minimum graduate residence credit requirement (including 300-level courses in English as a Second Language). Visit the Office of the Registrar’s Valid Grades webpage for more information.\nDeadlines\n\nMore\n\n\n\nStudents are responsible for learning about and complying with campus deadlines. Failure to meet deadlines for enrollment, payment of fees, changing courses or credits, and receiving a degree can cost time, money, or both. The Office of the Registrar’s Enrollment Deadlines page lists enrollment, fee payment, and course change deadlines. Visit the Graduate School’s Degree Deadlines page for more information about the deadlines for achieving dissertator status or receiving a degree in any given semester.\nGraduate students should note that Graduate School deadlines do not necessarily correspond to undergraduate enrollment deadlines. Refer to the Office of the Registrar’s Enrollment Deadlines for detailed and specific enrollment and refund deadlines and dates.\nSee Add/Drop, Course Changes, Pass/Fail, Withdrawal\nDean’s Approval\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe Graduate School acts as the academic dean’s office for all graduate students. If a student needs a dean’s approval or authorization, they should contact the Graduate School Office of Academic Services at gsacserv@grad.wisc.edu.\nDegree Completion Fee\n\nMore\n\n\n\nFor master’s students\nIn lieu of enrollment, the Graduate School may approve payment of a degree completion fee for a master’s degree candidate who has completed all of the degree requirements except thesis defense, comprehensive examination(s), presentation of a final project, or removal of an incomplete grade. To be eligible students must have submitted their final thesis or project paper to their advisor while they were enrolled. This fee is comparable to 2 graduate credits at the current resident tuition rate. This fee is established annually and assessed per semester. Students should ask their program to submit a Degree Completion Fee Request Form to the Graduate School on their behalf before the beginning of the semester when students are completing a master’s degree. After the Graduate School approves the request, the fee will be added to the student’s account. Students must pay the completion fee before the program requests a warrant.\nFor dissertators\nThe Graduate School requires all dissertators to maintain continuous enrollment (see the continuous enrollment policy for dissertators). Dissertators must enroll in the semester(s) in which they defend, submit their dissertations, and graduate (see enrollment requirements for dissertators). In rare circumstances where this is not possible, a degree completion fee is assessed to recognize the inevitable use of university facilities (including faculty and staff time) up to and including the successful defense and submission of the dissertation. The fee is equal to 12 times the current per-credit dissertator rate in effect at the time the dissertation is submitted. The fee is assessed at the time dissertators are ready to complete the degree and is based on the resident or nonresident tuition status dissertators had at their last term of enrollment. If dissertators break enrollment and then reenter and enroll for less than 4 continuous terms before completion, they will pay a prorated rate (the 12-credit fee minus all continuous enrollment credits paid since the time of readmission). If enrollment is broken, but a dissertator reenters and enrolls for at least 4 continuous terms, then a completion fee is not assessed. Students must pay the completion fee before the program requests a warrant\nSee Continuous Enrollment Requirement for Dissertators, Enrollment Requirements\nDegree Conferral/Payroll End Dates\n\nMore\n\n\n\nGraduate students who complete all degree requirements at any point during a term remain officially enrolled and retain student status through the official degree conferral date for that term, as determined by the Secretary of the Faculty and posted as conferral date on the transcript. Degrees are granted three times per year in May, August, and December. The official conferral date can be found on the Office of the Registrar’s Dates & Deadlines webpage.\nFunding for graduating students\nGraduate assistants, fellows, and trainees may remain on the payroll until the end of the term, as stated above, or may be removed if necessary for a change of status (e.g. to a postdoc or academic staff position) or end of grant funding. If a student is removed, the Bursar’s Office will check with the Graduate School to confirm graduation at the end of the given term and will maintain tuition remission for appropriately funded students if the student remains on payroll through the dates listed below:\n\nDoctoral candidates: through the date of dissertation deposit or through the official conferral date of term\nNon-thesis master’s candidates: through the completion date stated on warrant or through the official conferral date of term\nThesis master’s candidates: through the date thesis is received by the Memorial Library or through the official conferral date of term\n\nInternational students: contact International Student Services for guidance on the degree completion date and its impact on the visa status. The dates listed above may be different for international students.\nWindow Period degrees\nThe “Window Period” is the time between the end of one degree period and the beginning of the next. Students are eligible to complete their degree requirements during the window period if they were registered for the previous semester (fall, spring, or summer). If all degree requirements are met by the end of the window period, a student’s degree will be granted for the following semester. Students will not have to register or pay fees for the next semester.\nStudents receiving window period degrees may remain on payroll and retain student status only through the dates listed below:\n\nDoctoral candidates: through the date of dissertation deposit or through the last day of the window period\nNon-thesis master’s candidates: through the completion date stated on warrant\nThesis master’s candidates: through the date thesis is received by the Memorial Library\n\nInternational students: contact International Student Services for guidance on the degree completion date and its impact on the visa status. The dates listed above may be different for international students.\nSee Certification of Graduation (or ‘Degree Completion Letter’), Graduation\nDegree Summary\n\nMore\n\n\n\nA computerized graduate degree summary is not prepared for graduate students (e.g. the Degree Audit Reporting System, or DARS). Students’ programs, particularly their advisors, are responsible for ensuring timely fulfillment of Graduate School and program requirements. Students should consult their program’s satisfactory progress criteria in their program’s student handbook, or in the Graduate Guide.\nStudents and programs can check academic progress using the Graduate Student Tracking System.\nSee Advisor, Satisfactory Progress\nDisability Accommodations\n\nMore\n\n\n\nStudents with disabilities are encouraged to inform their faculty advisor and instructor of their need for disability-related accommodations in a timely manner. Implementation of reasonable accommodations is a shared faculty and student responsibility. Faculty, either directly or in coordination with the McBurney Disability Resource Center, are expected to work with students to identify and provide reasonable accommodations.\nThe McBurney Disability Resource Center provides disability-related services and accommodations to undergraduate, graduate, professional, special and guest students. The Center works closely with students and faculty on the provision of reasonable accommodations to ensure access to the learning environment. The Center makes referrals to other campus offices or community resources for non-classroom accommodations such as housing, transportation, personal care attendants, etc. Students should contact the Center upon admission to begin the eligibility for services process. Early notice is essential in order to have services and accommodations in place prior to the start of the semester.\nMcBurney Disability Resource Center\n702 West Johnson Street, Suite 2104\n608/263-2741 (voice)\n608/225-7956 (text)\nmcburney@studentlife.wisc.edu\nSee Discrimination\nDiscrimination\n\nMore\n\n\n\nIn conformance with applicable federal and state law and with university policy, UW–Madison does not discriminate on the basis of age, ancestry, color, creed, disability, ethnicity, marital or parental status, national origin, pregnancy, race, religion, disability, retaliation for making a complaint of discrimination or taking part in an investigation relating to discrimination, sex, sexual orientation, or veteran’s status with regard to treatment of students in the educational programs or activities that the university operates.\nShould students wish to speak to someone about discrimination or harassment protected by federal or state laws or campus policies, they should contact the Office of Compliance or the Office of Student Assistance and Support.\nDissertation Standards and Publishing\n\nMore\n\n\n\nA doctoral dissertation must be a dissertator’s own work. If it is the result of research enterprises in which others have collaborated, a substantial portion must represent the dissertator’s own contribution and the other research participants must be identified.\nEffective September 1, 2017, dissertations must acknowledge contributions received from other individuals, including co-authors of published work that appears in the document, such as in designing the research, executing the research, analyzing the data, interpreting the data/research, or writing, proofing, or copyediting the manuscript.\nPublication of the doctoral dissertation is required. The university uses ProQuest UMI ETD Administrator to publish the dissertation electronically and on microfilm and to publish an abstract of the dissertation in Dissertation Abstracts, a monthly publication. Dissertators must pay the cost of processing the dissertation and publishing the abstract by ProQuest.\nAll doctoral dissertations are reviewed by the Graduate School’s Office of Academic Services. More information can be found on the Graduate School’s Completing Your Degree webpage.\nMost master’s theses at UW–Madison are not published through ProQuest, although a student may choose to do so. If students want to publish their master’s thesis through ProQuest, they should contact the Graduate School’s Office of Academic Services.\nSee Copyright, Deadlines\nDissertator Status\n\nMore\n\n\n\nDissertator is a unique fee status for students who have completed all requirements for a doctoral degree except for the dissertation. To be eligible for dissertator fee status, a student must:\n\nPass the preliminary examination(s);\nSatisfy the doctoral minimum graduate residence credit requirement;\nComplete all minor requirements, if the major program requires a minor;\nComplete all program requirements except the dissertation;\nClear all Incomplete grades or Progress grades in non-research courses (progress grades in 990 research may remain);\nEarn at least a 3.0 cumulative graduate GPA;\nReturn the signed and dated preliminary exam warrant to the Graduate School.\n\nDissertator status is effective at the start of the semester following completion of all dissertator requirements for the doctoral degree except for the dissertation. In order to initiate the change to dissertator status, the prelim warrant must be sent to the Graduate School in a timely fashion. Students can check on dissertator status by contacting their graduate program coordinator. All dissertator requirements must be met before the first day of classes to be a dissertator for any given semester. If all dissertator requirements are completed before the first day of classes but the signed prelim warrant does not reach the Graduate School by that deadline, the student can still become a dissertator that semester. Submit the warrant to the Graduate School as soon as possible and enroll for at least 3 credits (usually 990 research) for that semester. Removal of Dissertator Status: A dissertator who enrolls for more (or fewer) than 3 credits will be removed from dissertator status for the fall or spring term in which the enrollment is not exactly 3 credits. During the summer, however, an enrolled dissertator may ask their advisor to request an overload of 1-2 additional credits in a short session and still retain dissertator fee status, if the course is related to dissertation research or professional training that is not offered in regular semesters. The removal of dissertator status may have the following consequences:\n\nGraduate assistant (TA/PA/RA) stipend rates may have to be adjusted to the non-dissertator rate, or percent limitations\nFees are assessed at the non-dissertator rate\nFull-time status may change to part-time, possibly affecting loan deferral, visa status, etc.\n\nIf a dissertator wants to pursue a graduate degree or certificate in another area, the dissertator fee status will be discontinued and regular graduate fees will be assessed, with possible consequences listed above. Find more information about the tuition and fees for a dissertator and non-dissertator on the Bursar’s Office Tuition and Fees webpage.\nSee Addition/Change of Program, Plan, or Named Option, Enrollment Requirements, Maximum Levels of Appointments, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement\nDoctoral Minors\n\nMore\n\n\n\nBreadth is a required component of doctoral training at UW–Madison. Given there are multiple paths to breadth, the Graduate School leaves the choice of whether students achieve breadth through a doctoral minor (two options as described below), Graduate/Professional certificate, or other means up to the specific graduate program.  The specific Breadth Requirement Policy, including information on certificates, is found here: https://policy.wisc.edu/library/UW-1200\nMinor options are as follows:\nOption A (external doctoral minor): Requires a minimum of 9 credits in a doctoral minor program (single disciplinary or multi-disciplinary). Fulfillment of this option requires the approval of the doctoral minor program.\nOption B (distributed doctoral minor): Requires a minimum of 9 credits in one or more programs forming a coherent topic.  Fulfillment of this option requires the approval of the doctoral major program.\nThe Graduate School’s minimum course requirements for the doctoral minor include:\n\nAn average GPA of 3.00 on all minor coursework;\nCoursework must be graded courses numbered 300 or above; no audits or pass/fail;\nMaximum 3 credits of independent study (e.g., 699, 799, 899, 999);\nResearch and thesis cannot be used to satisfy the minor (e.g., 790, 890, 990);\nNo more than 5 credits of coursework completed more than 5 years prior to admission to the doctoral program; coursework taken 10 years ago or more may not be used.\n\nA student cannot earn a doctoral minor and a Graduate/Professional certificate of the same name. Credits earned towards the doctoral minor may count towards the minimum graduate residence requirement, minimum graduate degree requirement, and the minimum graduate coursework (50%) requirement.\nSee Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Prior Coursework\nDouble Degrees\n\nMore\n\n\n\nDouble degrees are two same-level (master’s or doctoral) degrees from two separate graduate programs. Students completing a double degree earn two degrees (two programs), and receive two diplomas. Double degree candidates have two advisors and two separate committees, and they complete two theses (master’s) or dissertations (doctoral).\nStudents may apply for an additional program at the time of original application, add a program at any time during their enrollment, or reapply and pursue a second degree after completion of the first.  Students should inquire with each program prior to enrollment to see if additional policies exist that would restrict the ability to complete a double degree.\nIn all scenarios, regardless of whether double degree programs are completed consecutively or concurrently, students must:\n\nBe admitted to both programs;\nFulfill the Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence, degree, and coursework credit requirements for each degree;\nComplete the specific degree requirements for each program, including minimum graduate degree, residence, and coursework (50%) credit requirements for each;\nHave no more than a 25% credit overlap between degrees, based on the lower credit requirements of the two programs;\nHave an advisor from each program and both advisors must be informed of each other.\n\nApproval of the double degree: at the time of graduation, each program must submit to the Graduate School a list of the courses being used to satisfy that program’s requirements. Both advisors must sign the course lists as indication of approval. The Graduate School will review the course lists for credit overlap between degrees.\nDoctoral students who add a master’s degree program outside the doctoral program cannot be dissertators.\nInternational students must contact International Student Services before adding a second degree program.\nSee Addition/Change of Program, Plan, or Named Option, Change of Degree Level (Plan), International Students Maintaining Legal Status, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Appendix 5 – Double, Joint, and Dual Degrees at a Glance\nDouble, Joint, and Dual Degrees Comparison\n\nMore\n\n\n\nDouble Degree\n\n2 degrees, 2 diplomas\n2 graduate majors\n2 advisors, 2 committees\n2 theses or dissertations\nMinimum Graduate School requirements for each degree\n2 prelims (PhD)\n2 warrant requests, 2 warrants\nList of courses used for each major must be submitted to GS when requesting warrants.\nNo more than 25% overlap (of the total credits for the program with lowest credit requirement).\n\nJoint Degree\n\n1 degree, 1 diploma\n2 graduate majors\n2 advisors, 1 committee\n1 thesis or dissertation\nJoint prelim, if both major programs agree, or 2 prelims (PhD)\n1 warrant request, 1 warrant\nMust submit proposal to GS before beginning of second year.  Need signatures of both advisors and both program directors, and Graduate School approval.\n\nDual Degree\n\nOne graduate degree and one professional degree (i.e. a degree from the School of Medicine and Public Health or the Law school).\nDual Degrees: Graduate and Professional Combination\n\nMore\n\n\n\nA dual degree is two degrees, one of which is granted in a graduate program, and the other in a professional school (e.g., MD, JD, DVM, DPharm, MPH). Students must inquire with each program prior to enrollment to see if additional policies exist that would restrict the ability to complete a dual degree.\nTo receive a dual degree students must:\n\nBe admitted to both programs;\nComplete the specific degree requirements for the Graduate School and the professional school;\nFulfill the Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence, degree, and coursework (50%) credit requirements for the graduate degree.\n\nTuition is determined by a combined fee schedule table. Assessed fees are roughly halfway between graduate fees and professional fees. Credit limits each semester coincide with the professional schools’ higher credit maximums. Find more information about the tuition and fees on the Bursar’s Office Tuition and Fees webpage.\nSee Addition/Change of Program, Plan, or Named Option, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Appendix 5 – Double, Joint, and Dual Degrees at a Glance\nEffective Date of Program Requirements upon Enrollment\n\nMore\n\n\n\nAny student entering or readmitted to a graduate program must adhere to the requirements in the most current Academic Policies & Procedures and Graduate Guide. This includes all new incoming students, those students continuing from a master’s degree to a doctoral degree, add/change program students, degree completion fee students, and any readmitted students. A student who chooses to discontinue their degree program for a semester or more would return under the requirements in the most recent Academic Policies & Procedures.\nStudents enrolled prior to fall 2014 in a MFA, specialist certificate, or doctoral degree program have the option to complete their degree under the prior policy requirements if they maintain continuous enrollment.\nA student who advances from the master’s level to the doctoral level fall 2014 or after is subject to the requirements in the most current Academic Policies & Procedures.\nAppeals will be considered in exceptional cases. The request for appeal must be made on a student-by-student basis. The appeal should come from the students faculty advisor and/or program chair and be sent to the Graduate School Director of Academic Services. The appeal should include sufficient justification for the request and any supporting documentation.\nSee Continuous Enrollment Requirement\nEnrollment\n\nMore\n\n\n\nCourse enrollment is available through MyUW in the Course Search and Enroll App or the Student Center. Once enrolled, students should confirm that they are enrolled in the appropriate number of graduate-level graded courses. Students should enroll early to avoid a late initial enrollment fee and class cancellation due to low enrollment. Visit the Office of the Registrar’s website for more information about enrollment deadlines.\nSee Enrollment Requirements\nEnrollment Accountability\n\nMore\n\n\n\nStudents are responsible for the accuracy of their enrollment/class schedule and for all tuition, fees, and academic consequences that result from that schedule. Continuing students in good standing may enroll for the next term without special permission from the Graduate School. Before enrolling, students should consult their advisor to approve their class schedule for that term and to determine if they need authorization for any proposed courses. Note that graduate students may not enroll in Honors credits, as those are for undergraduate students only.\nAll students must use the online enrollment system. Instructions on how to enroll using MyUW along with additional enrollment information is available through the Office of the Registrar’s website. The Office of the Registrar also provides enrollment demos and tutorials. All students will receive an email message from the Office of the Registrar about their assigned enrollment appointment time. Students can expect to receive this notification about one week prior to the beginning of the priority enrollment period. There are extra fees for late initial enrollment and late fee payment. These deadlines are available at the Office of the Registrar’s Enrollment Deadlines webpage.\nSee Enrollment, Enrollment Requirements, Holds, Late Enrollment/Late Course Change/Late Drop, Overloads, Readmission to Graduate School (for previously enrolled graduate students), Schedule of Classes\nEnrollment Confirmation\n\nMore\n\n\n\nStudents can confirm their current enrollment status through MyUW.\nFailure to receive a student account invoice does not relieve students of the obligation to meet established fee payment deadlines as displayed in the MyUW Student Center, Class Search. If a student does not receive an invoice by late August (mid-January for spring semester), they can get a copy at the Bursar’s Office.\nEnrollment Requirements\n\nMore\n\n\n\nALL of the following credit requirements (except F-1 and J-1 visa requirements) must be satisfied by graded courses taken at 300 or above; courses numbered below 300, audit, and pass/fail do not satisfy enrollment requirements.\nFull-time enrollment: The Graduate School considers full-time enrollment to be 8-15 graded credits* taken at 300 or above, excluding pass/fail and audit, during the fall and spring semesters, and 4-12 credits* during the summer term. Dissertators are considered full-time at 3 credits. If students elect not to enroll as full-time students as defined by the Graduate School, they are responsible for knowing about possible obligations that may require full-time status. Such obligations may include visa eligibility, fellowships, assistantships, financial aid, external funding agencies, and program satisfactory progress requirements.\nMaximum enrollment: Non-dissertator maximum credit load is 15 graded credits* taken at 300 or above during the fall and spring semester and 12 credits during the summer term. Any exceptions to the maximum credit load permitted must be obtained via the Credit Overload Request form.\nMinimum enrollment: Non-dissertator minimum credit load is 2 credits* during the fall and spring semesters. Graduate students must be enrolled in their program for at least the minimum requirement in the semester in which they receive a degree; master’s degree students expecting a summer degree must be enrolled in their program for a minimum of 2 graduate credits in any summer session*. Graduate students who do not need to maintain full-time status (including TAs and PAs) have a 2 credit enrollment minimum during fall and spring semesters. Minimum requirements must be fulfilled by courses taken for a grade (not pass/fail or audit) and must be taken at 300 or above.\nUnderload: During the fall and spring semesters, non-dissertators must enroll for a minimum of 2 credits.* Audit and pass/fail courses do not satisfy this enrollment requirement. Dissertators are required to enroll for 3 graded credits taken at 300 or above and directly related to their dissertation research.\nThe specific situations listed below have special enrollment requirements.\nDissertators: Dissertators must enroll in exactly 3 credits* directly related to their dissertation (generally research and thesis or required seminars) during fall and spring semesters. Dissertators are considered full-time at 3 credits*. Dissertators who are summer RAs, trainees or fellows, or who expect to graduate in summer, must enroll in the general 8-week summer session (DHH) for 3 credits*. Additional courses for credit, audit, or pass/fail will result in removal of dissertator status and tuition assessment at the regular graduate rate.\nOnce dissertator status has been achieved, courses other than 990 must be directly related to the dissertation research and approved by the advisor. Dissertators must enroll during the semester or general 8-week summer session (DHH) in which they expect to earn a degree. Students must be enrolled during the semester when they defend the dissertation and when they deposit the dissertation. If defending and depositing in two different semesters, the student is required to be enrolled in both semesters. Students do not have to be dissertators during the semester or summer in which they expect to earn a doctoral degree, but they must be eligible for dissertator status before they complete the doctoral degree, and they must enroll in the semester in which they will graduate.\nIf a student enrolls before the dissertator status is approved, the enrollment system may indicate they are not eligible for that course. The enrollment system does not care if students are dissertators. If students had problems getting into a course, it is probably because permission has not been entered into the enrollment system. Most individualized study courses, such as research and thesis, require instructor’s permission and online authorization before enrollment is possible.\nIf dissertator status is not processed by the segregated fee deadline, students should register for 3 credits and pay regular non-dissertator graduate fees. The fee difference will be adjusted for that semester when dissertator status is indicated in the system.\nMaster’s with thesis required: A master’s degree candidate required to submit a thesis to Memorial Library, as indicated on the degree warrant, must be enrolled in the semester in which they defend their thesis. If a student defends in a window period, they need to have been enrolled in the previous term. A student does not need to be enrolled to deposit their thesis to Memorial Library.\nAssistantship appointees: It is against university policy to hold an assistantship without being appropriately enrolled.  Assistantships include those at UW-Madison as well as any UW System institution, including UW–Extension.\nRA (Research Assistant): RAs are required to carry a full load each semester (8 to 15 credits* including research or thesis credits for non-dissertators, 3 credits* for dissertators) and at least 2 credits* during the general 8-week summer session (DHH) (3 credits* for dissertators). Dissertators who hold assistantships are considered full-time with 3 credits* directly related to their dissertation.\nTA (Teaching Assistant) and PA (Project Assistant):\nMinimum enrollment for PAs and TAs is 2 credits* (3 credits* for dissertators) during the fall and spring semesters.\n\nTo be considered full-time by the Registrar for loan deferment and for certification of student immigration status, non-dissertator PAs and TAs who hold an appointment of at least 33.33% must be enrolled for 6 credits*, or those who hold an appointment of at least 50% must be enrolled for 4 credits*.\nDissertator PAs and TAs are considered full-time with 3 credits* directly related to their dissertation (generally research and thesis or required seminars).\nMaximum enrollment for PAs and TAs is 15 credits* during the fall and spring.\nThe Graduate School has no enrollment requirement for the summer session for PAs and TAs, unless the student is receiving a summer degree, but individual programs may.\n\nFellows: Non-dissertator graduate students holding fellowships that are payrolled through the university must be enrolled full-time: 8 credits* during the fall and spring semester. Fellows who are non-dissertators with 12-month appointments must also enroll in 2 credits* during the general 8-week summer session (DHH). Those who are not payrolled as fellows over the summer are not required to be enrolled. Those who are payrolled as fellows during any part of the summer term must enroll in the general 8-week summer session (DHH). Fellows who are dissertators must enroll in 3 credits* during the fall and spring semesters. Fellows with 12-month appointments who are dissertators must also enroll in 3 credits* during the general 8-week summer session (DHH).\nTrainees: Trainees must carry a full load each fall and spring semester of 8 to 15 credits* including research or thesis credits for non-dissertators (3 credits* for dissertators), and at least 2 credits* during the general 8-week summer session (DHH) (3 credits* for dissertators).\nInternational students: Both F-1 and J-1 student visa regulations require students to be enrolled full-time each fall and spring semester (8 credits, not taken as audit). Summer enrollment is not required by the U.S. federal government regulations for F-1/J-1 visa holders. However, summer enrollment may be required due to other circumstances; see summer enrollment requirements for assistantships, fellowships, traineeships, and graduating students. Failure to maintain full-time status can result in loss of F-1/J-1 student benefits, including on-campus employment and practical/academic training options. Any exceptions to full-time enrollment must be authorized by International Student Services (ISS). Visit the ISS webpage to learn more about visa requirements. Permission from ISS to drop below full-time enrollment does NOT exempt an international student from meeting the enrollment requirement determined by a Teaching Assistantship (TA), Project Assistantship (PA), Research Assistantship (RA), fellowship, traineeship, or dissertator status.\nInternational students-online learning credit limit: F-1 and J-1 student visa holders have restrictions regarding the number of online credits that can be taken during the semester as it relates to fulfilling the full-time enrollment requirement.  There are also restrictions regarding online enrollment during the final term of study-especially when the final term for completion is in summer. For more information, visit the ISS Online Course Enrollment webpage.\nSummer enrollment requirements: Students must be enrolled at UW–Madison if they are using university facilities, including faculty and staff time.\n\nDissertators defending and/or depositing dissertation (completing their degree) in summer must enroll for 3 credits* in the general 8-week summer session (DHH).\nDissertator RAs must enroll for 3 credits* in the general 8-week summer session (DHH).\nDissertator fellows with 12-month appointments are required to enroll for 3 credits* in the general 8-week summer session (DHH).\nDissertator trainees with 12-month appointments are required to enroll for 3 credits* in the general 8-week summer session (DHH).\nMaster’s candidates, who expect to graduate in summer must enroll for at least 2 credits* in any session, short session or general 8-week summer session (DHH).\nNon-dissertators completing a summer doctoral degree must enroll for at least 2 credits* in the general 8-week summer session (DHH).\nNon-dissertator RAs must enroll for 2 credits* in the general 8-week summer session (DHH).\nNon-dissertator TAs and PAs not receiving a summer degree have no enrollment requirement. However, those who held such an appointment during the previous semester may qualify for summer tuition remission and are advised to consult with their employing department if they wish to enroll.\nNon-dissertator fellows with 12-month appointments are required to enroll for at least 2 credits* in the general 8-week summer session (DHH).\nNon-dissertator trainees are required to enroll for at least 2 credits* in the general 8-week summer session (DHH).\nInternational students who are completing a summer degree are required to enroll for at least 2 credits* in the general 8-week summer session (DHH).\nInternational students who are RAs in the summer are required to enroll for at least 2 credits* in the general 8-week summer session (DHH).\nInternational students who are not completing a summer degree and who are not RAs have no summer enrollment requirement mandated by the U.S. federal government regulations for F-1/J-1 visa holders.\n\nFinancial aid, loan deferral & taxes: In most cases, students are eligible for federal loans and federal loan payment deferral when enrolled at least half-time, which is 4 credits* for the fall and spring semesters. However, individual cases may vary, and students are advised to seek individual advice at the UW–Madison Office of Student Financial Aid. Payroll and FICA taxes can be impacted if students are not enrolled at least half-time. More information can be found here.\nFull-Time Enrollment Status at a Glance\nALL of the following credit requirements (except F-1 and J-1 visa requirements) must be satisfied by graded courses taken at 300 or above; courses numbered below 300, audit, and pass/fail do not satisfy enrollment requirements.\n\n\n\nCategories\nMinimum enrollment for full-time status: Fall or Spring\nMinimum enrollment for full-time status: Summer (general 8-week DHH session)\n\n\n\n\nDissertator\nExactly 3 credits directly related to research\nNot required unless receiving summer degree or if RA, trainee (with 12-month appointment), or fellow (with 12-month appointment), 3 cr. required.\n\n\nRA, non-dissertator\n8 cr.\n2 cr.\n\n\nTA/Lecturer (SA) 33%, non-dissertator\n6 cr.\nNot required unless receiving summer degree, 2 cr. minimum.\n\n\nTA/Lecturer (SA) 50%, non-dissertator\n4 cr.\nNot required unless receiving summer degree, 2 cr. minimum.\n\n\nPA 33%, non-dissertator\n6 cr.\nNot required unless receiving summer degree, 2 cr. minimum.\n\n\nPA 50%, non-dissertator\n4 cr.\nNot required unless receiving summer degree, 2 cr. minimum.\n\n\nFellow, non-dissertator\n8 cr.\n2 cr. for 12-month appointments.

The survey collects information on academic experiences, advising, and future plans.\nSurvey of Earned Doctorates (SED): The SED is a federally-sponsored national survey of individuals receiving research degrees from all U.S. institutions and the results are used to assess characteristics and trends in doctoral education. The SED is to be completed by PhD students, not DMA, DNP or AuD students.\nGraduate School Doctoral Exit Survey (DES): The Graduate School surveys all students graduating with a doctoral degree. The DES collects additional information on academic experiences, e.g., advising and other academic support.\nMaster’s Degree Completion Survey: All students completing master’s degrees are asked to answer a brief online survey about their plans for employment or for additional education. Students will receive an email with a link to the survey at the time of the final warrant request.\nThe doctoral exit surveys must be completed before submitting your dissertation electronically. Each individual survey will provide a certificate of completion once you have submitted the survey. The individual certificates of completion should each be saved as PDF documents to be uploaded in the administrative documents section of the ProQuest/UMI ETD Administrator website.\nDirections for completing the doctoral surveys are in the Graduate School’s Guide to Preparing your Doctoral Dissertation.\nSee Final Oral Examination (Defense)\nExtension Courses\n\nMore\n\n\n\nA student paying full-time tuition and fees at the UW–Madison campus may ask to take courses at UW–Extension for no additional cost (if the total credit load does not exceed the maximum allowable credit load). A student’s faculty advisor must submit a completed UW–Madison Tuition Waiver Request Form, along with a letter of endorsement to the Graduate School. If the Graduate School approves, the student may take the course without paying additional fees. Courses completed at UW–Extension do not fulfill the Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence, degree, or coursework credit requirements and will not appear on the student’s UW–Madison transcript. Dissertators are not allowed to request a tuition waiver while remaining eligible for the dissertator fee status, they would need to request to be removed from dissertator status and enroll full-time and pay fees at the regular graduate student fee rate.\nSee Dissertator Status, Enrollment Requirements, Overloads\nFailing Grades\n\nMore\n\n\n\nCourses numbered 300 and above graded F are included in the graduate GPA and do not count toward the Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence, degree, and coursework (50%) credit requirements.\nSee Grade Point Average (GPA) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Repeating Courses\nFamily Leave\n\nMore\n\n\n\nAlthough the Graduate School does not have a formal leave of absence policy for pre-dissertators, there are a number of family-friendly practices and resources for students considering taking a leave of absence for birth or adoption. Many departments and programs also have local policies. Students should consult with their program coordinator, advisor, and the Graduate School’s Office Academic Services as early as possible in their planning process.\nPlease visit the Graduate School’s Family and Parent Resources webpage for additional information.\nSee Compassionate Tuition Adjustment, Leave of Absence\nFellowships\n\nMore\n\n\n\nFellowships are monetary awards that students use to pursue graduate studies. In general, fellowships require no work obligations on the part of the recipient.\nCampus Fellowships: Merit-based campus and departmental fellowships are sometimes awarded to UW–Madison graduate students by their graduate programs. To inquire about eligibility and application procedures, students must contact their graduate program.\nExternal Fellowships: Many federal agencies, professional organizations, and private foundations provide fellowships for students pursuing graduate studies. Students are encouraged to look for and apply for external fellowships, and to understand the unique terms and conditions of each fellowship for which they apply. The Graduate School supports a number of federal/private fellowships through the provision of tuition support and health insurance. If students are awarded one of these fellowships, they should contact the UW–Madison Fellowship Officer at funding@grad.wisc.edu.\nInternational Fellowships: The Institute for Regional and International Studies serves as a resource center and provides information and support to faculty, students, and staff interested in identifying international research grants, scholarships, and other funding opportunities, including programs sponsored by Fulbright, National Security Education Program (Boren Scholarship), HEA (Higher Education Act), Title VI-FLAS (Foreign Languages and Area Studies), and other program competitions. Questions about funding for international research should be directed to the Institute for Regional and International Studies (IRIS).\nFor further information on fellowships, visit the Graduate School’s Funding Information webpage.\nSee Enrollment Requirements, International Students Maintaining Legal Status, Maximum Levels of Appointments, Tuition Remission, Payroll Benefits for Graduate Assistants, Fellows, and Trainees\nFinal Examination (Dissertation Defense)\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe final examination (often called “defense”) normally covers a student’s dissertation and areas of study. Students may not take the final examination until they have satisfied all other requirements for their degree. Students’ records must be cleared of incomplete grades and progress grades (other than research) before they can take the final exam.\nDoctoral students have five years from the date of passing their preliminary examinations to take their final examination and deposit their dissertation. Arrangements for the final examination and the  examination committee’s approval of the dissertation are the responsibilities of the student and the program. The graduate program coordinator must submit the final doctoral warrant request to the Graduate School at least three weeks before the final examination.\nAfter the graduate program coordinator submits the doctoral degree warrant request, the Graduate School will review this request and send the approved doctoral degree warrant to the graduate program coordinator. The final warrant should be printed out and committee member signatures should be obtained the defense. To pass the examination, students must receive no more than one dissenting vote from their committee. A missing signature is considered a dissent. Once the final warrant has been signed, an electronic copy should be uploaded in the administrative documents section of the ProQuest/UMI ETD Administrator website. The original signed hard copy of the final warrant should be kept with the student or the graduate program coordinator. For further information, visit the Graduate School’s Guide to Preparing Your Doctoral Dissertation.\nSee Preliminary Examinations, Time Limits\nFive-Year Rule\n\nMore\n\n\n\nStudents have five years from the date of their preliminary examination to take their final oral examination and deposit their dissertation.\nSee Preliminary Examinations, Time Limits\nForms\n\nMore\n\n\n\nAdd/Change Program\nCredit Overload\nLate Course Add\nLate Course Drop\nLate Initial Enrollment\nDegree Completion Fee Request\nTranscript Request\nWithdrawal\nGrade Change\n\nMore\n\n\n\nGrade changes originate with the instructor of the course. The instructor submits a grade change through the MyUW Faculty Center. Instructions are available through the Office of the Registrar’s Grading FAQ webpage. If the change cannot be completed via the online system, the instructor submits a paper Grade Change Form, and the program chair signs and submits it to the Graduate School Office of Academic Services.\nWhile changes from Incomplete or Progress to a final grade are routine and raise no questions, changes from one final grade to another are more serious matters. Doing extra work to improve a final grade is not allowed. Faculty legislation states that final grades can be changed only because of clerical error. Once an instructor announces course grades, a decision to re-evaluate the coursework for all or some of the students breaks faith with those students. The university’s primary concern is that all students in a course are treated consistently and fairly when assigned final grades.\nGrade Point Average (GPA) Requirement\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe Graduate School requires that students maintain a graduate grade-point average (GPA) of 3.00 (on a 4.00 scale) for all graduate courses (excluding research) to receive a degree. Many programs impose higher standards. Students should check with their program.\nWhen a graduate student’s cumulative GPA drops below a 3.0 for one semester, they are notified via email (copy to grad coordinator) that they are placed on academic probation, and an enrollment hold is placed on the following semester. Students on academic probation cannot continue enrolling until the probationary semester’s grades are reported and their cumulative GPA is above a 3.0.\nCourses taken for audit (S/NR), credit/no credit (CR/N), or pass/fail do not affect the GPA. Research courses graded on a Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) basis do not impact GPA. However, U grades are monitored by the Graduate School for satisfactory progress. A Permanent Incomplete (PI) grade does not impact the GPA. A No Report (NR) or Incomplete (I) grade does not impact the GPA, but in a graded course this is a temporary grade, indicating the instructor has not yet submitted a final grade.\nSee Auditing Courses, Credit/No Credit Grades, No Report (NR) Grades, Pass/Fail, Permanent Incomplete (PI) Grade, Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) Grades, Appendix 3 – Grading System, Appendix 4 – Grade-Point Average Calculation\nGrading System\n\nMore\n\n\n\nUW–Madison uses a 4.00 grading scale (A=4.00, AB=3.50, etc.). Grades are assigned only by instructors and are electronically reported by letter grade. Plus and minus grades are not used.\nStudents should check with individual professors about grading scales for specific courses.\nAll courses taken as a graduate student that are numbered 300 and above in which a student receives a grade of A, AB, B, BC, C, or S will count toward the Graduate School’s minimum credit requirement.  Courses with grades of P (“in progress”) fulfill the Graduate School’s minimum credit requirement only if they are research courses.  Courses taken under the 300 level, or for audit, pass/fail; or in which a  student receives grades of D or F do not count.\nFor courses listed as research, the only permissible final grades are P (Progress), S (Satisfactory), or U (Unsatisfactory). If a P grade is assigned, it will remain until the faculty member assigns a grade of S or U. All previously assigned P grades in research courses will revert to an S or U upon assignment of the final grade. Research courses (even with grades from terms earlier than Summer 1999) do not count in a student’s GPA. Research courses are traditionally reserved for graduate students; however, other students (Law, Medical, Undergraduate, etc.) occasionally enroll for a research course. In these cases, the student’s college can decide to have the course count in the GPA with an academic action submitted to the Office of the Registrar.\nTo convert UW–Madison Law School numerical grades to the Graduate School’s grading scale, the Graduate School uses the following scale:\n85-100 A\n83-84 AB\n77-82 B\n75-76 BC\n72-74 C\n67-71 D\n65-66 F\nInternational equivalencies may be available in the Wisconsin Directory of International Institutions.\nSee Grade Point Average (GPA) Requirement, Permanent Incomplete (PI) Grade, Progress (P) Grades, Grading System and GPA Calculation\nGrading System and GPA Calculation\n\nMore\n\n\n\nGrades are assigned only by instructors and are reported only by letter grade. Plus and minus grades are not accepted.\nThe university uses the following grading system:\nGrade Grade-points per credit\n\nA Excellent 4\nAB Intermediate 3.5\nB Good 3\nBC Intermediate 2.5\nC Fair 2\nD Poor 1\nF Failure 0\n\nThe following grades have no associated grade points and are excluded from the graduate Grade Point Average (GPA):\n\nS Satisfactory\nU Unsatisfactory\nI Incomplete (a temporary grade when work is not completed)\nP Progress\nPI Permanent Incomplete\nDR Dropped\nW Withdrew\nCR Credit\nN No Credit\nIN Incomplete in Credit/No Credit Course (a temporary grade when work is not completed)\nM Missing – used for audited courses\nNR No Report (a temporary grade for a graded course when a final grade has not been submitted by the instructor; a final grade for an audited course when the student did not meet the instructor’s minimum standards)\nNW No Work – used for non-attendance in a course\nQ Question on Credits\n\nGPA Calculation\n\nTo calculate graduate GPA:\n\nRefer to the list above to find the grade-point value of each letter grade on your transcript.\nMultiply the grade-point value by the number of credits for the course. For example, a three (3) credit AB would be calculated as:\n\n\n\n\n3.5\ngrade-points for an AB\n\n\n×\n3\ncredits\n\n\n\n10.5\ngrade-points\n\n\n\n\nContinue this calculation for every course numbered 300 and above that you took as a graduate student. Do include independent study courses and seminars. Do not include research courses; each department determines course numbers for their research courses. Do not include courses taken as a University Special student. Add the total number of grade points earned and the total number of credits earned.\nDivide the total number of grade points by the total number of credits.\n\n\n\n\n215\ngrade-points\n\n\n÷\n60\ncredits\n\n\n\n3.58\nGPA\n\n\n\n\nThis final figure is your graduate GPA.\n\n\n\nThe UW–Madison Cross College Advising Service GPA Calculator may be a useful tool.\nGraduate/Professional Certificates\n\nMore\n\n\n\nGraduate/professional certificates are available to all degree-seeking graduate and professional students (GRAD, LAW, MED, PHARM, VMED careers) and may be used by doctoral students in meeting their breadth requirement (see policy on Breadth Requirement in Doctoral Training). Graduate/professional certificate programs coordinate teaching and research among scholars active in interrelated disciplines. Consult the certificate program regarding recognition of program completion. Certificate programs monitor their own course and satisfactory progress requirements.\nStudents wishing to pursue a certificate must submit a request to add it to their academic career through the Add/Change/Discontinue application process in the MyGradPortal. This should be done as soon as a student knows they wish to add the certificate and before completing the classes for the certificate.  The certificate must be on the student’s academic career before the prelim (doctoral students) or degree warrant (master’s students) is requested.\nA list of all graduate/professional certificates with specific information for each is  available in the Graduate Guide on the Graduate/Professional Certificates page.\nSee Capstone Certificates\nGraduation\n\nMore\n\n\n\nTo receive a master’s degree, students contact their program coordinator at the beginning of the term in which they intend to graduate. The program coordinator will check that they have met program requirements and will request a warrant from the Graduate School on the student’s behalf. Students need to be enrolled in their program and taking a minimum of 2 credits (graded courses taken at 300 or above; audits and pass/fails do not satisfy this requirement) during the term in which they intend to graduate. For more information and deadlines visit the Graduate School’s Completing Your Master’s Degree webpage.\nDoctoral candidates’ major programs should request a final doctoral warrant at least 3 weeks before the anticipated date of their final dissertation defense. Doctoral candidates must be enrolled during the term in which they intend to defend or graduate. For more information and deadlines visit the Graduate School’s Completing Your Doctoral Degree webpage.\nSee Certification of Graduation (or ‘Degree Completion Letter’), Deadlines, Degree Completion Fee, Degree Conferral/Payroll End Dates, Dissertation and Thesis Standards and Publishing, Dissertation Defense (Final Examination)\nGrievances and Appeals\n\nMore\n\n\n\nIf a student feels unfairly treated or aggrieved by faculty, staff, or another student, the university offers several avenues to resolve the concern. All graduate programs, departments and schools/colleges have established specific grievance procedures for handling such situations; these grievance procedures are found in the program’s Graduate Guide page under the policy tab.\nThe department-school/college academic grievance process should be used to resolve academic issues or disputes. Examples of matters suitable for this process may include a qualifying exam failure, author dispute, or concerns regarding advising/mentoring, to name a few.\nGraduate Assistants in TA, PA and/or RA appointments may utilize the Graduate Assistantship Policies and Procedures (GAPP) grievance process to resolve employment-related issues. Examples of matters appropriate for the GAPP grievance process include allegations of violation of GAPP, including allegations excessive work hours, violations of sick days or vacation policies, or disputes regarding the assignment of duties.\nFor issues involving hostile and intimidating behavior (HIB) by a faculty or staff member, students should contact the Graduate School Assistant Dean for Academic Services for information on accessing the the appropriate HIB process.\nFor issues involving civil rights, ADA, Equal Opportunity or Sexual Misconduct, students should contact the Office of Compliance.\nIf you have questions about whether the grievance policy at the program level or GAPP procedure would be suitable for your concern, you are encouraged to reach out to your college, school or division human resources representative.\nThrough A Graduate Student Guide to Working with Faculty Advisors, an interactive, self-paced micro-course, graduate students learn about the characteristics of functional and dysfunctional relationships with faculty advisors, strategies for communicating effectively and aligning expectations, as well as program grievance processes and Hostile and Intimidating Behavior resources. Completion of the micro-course takes about 20 minutes and is optional but encouraged for all graduate students.\nIn addition, the following administrative offices have procedures available for addressing various concerns:\nOffice of Student Assistance and Support (for all issues of concern involving students)\n70 Bascom Hall\n608-263-5700\nEmployee Assistance Office (for conflicts involving graduate assistants and other employees)\nRm. 1109 WARF Building, 610 Walnut St.\n608-263-2987\nOmbuds Office for Faculty and Staff (for graduate students and post-docs, as well as faculty and staff)\n523-524 Lowell Center\n608-265-9992\nGraduate School (for informal advice at any level of review and for official appeals of program/departmental or school/college grievance decisions)\n217 Bascom Hall\n500 Lincoln Drive\nMadison, WI 53706-1380\n608-262-2433\nGraduate students have two levels of appeal when they disagree with the outcome of a grievance or academic decision made at the program/departmental level; these occur in sequence. The first appeal is to the school/college and final appeals are to the Graduate School.\nGraduate School Appeal Process\nGraduate students who believe their appeal was not appropriately handled or resolved at the school/college level may appeal to the Graduate School using the process described below. (For students in programs housed in the Graduate School, the appeal of a program decision will typically be handled by the school/college in which the faculty/academic advisor of the student has their tenure/primary appointment before an appeal may be considered by the Graduate School.)\nAppeals of school/college decisions to the Graduate School should be based upon one or both of the following grounds:\n\nThere was a procedural error that substantially affected the fairness or outcome of the school/college grievance or academic decision appeal process.\nThe information in the record does not support the school/college decision.\n\nIf a student believes that their appeal meets one or both grounds listed above, they may file an official appeal of a school/college decision with the Graduate School using the process described below.\nA student must submit an appeal to the Graduate School Assistant Dean for Academic Services within 14 calendar days of the school/college decision. Prior to submitting an appeal, students are encouraged to contact the Assistant Dean to obtain information about the process, timelines, and to seek clarification of any questions they may have about the process.\nTo be considered, appeals must include the following information:\n\nThe student’s name, local address, university email address and phone number.\nThe student’s program name and degree level.\nThe ground(s) upon which the appeal is based and for each ground stated, an explanation of why the student’s appeal meets those criteria.\nCopies of the department and school/college appeal decisions and any other relevant communications.\n\nUpon receipt of all the above materials:\n\nThe Assistant Dean for Academic Services will forward the appeal and related documents to the Dean of the Graduate School.\nThe student will be notified in writing within 10 calendar days after the appeal materials arrive in the Graduate School, acknowledging receipt of the formal appeal and giving the student a timeline for the appeal to be completed.\nThe program and school/college will be notified of the appeal to the Graduate School and will be provided with a copy of the student’s appeal statement and associated documents.  The program and school/college will be invited to submit a written response.\nThe dean will appoint an advisory committee comprised of faculty and/or staff with the appropriate expertise to evaluate the appeal.\nThe dean will charge the committee and set appropriate time frame (30 calendar days within the fall and spring semester; appeals received in the summer may take up to 60 calendar days) for completing a review and making a recommendation.\n\n\nThe committee will review the student’s appeal, including all the materials previously submitted. If necessary, the committee may request and review additional information relevant to the appeal from the student and/or program/department/School/College before making a recommendation.\nThe dean will issue the final decision in writing.\nHolds (Service Indicators)\n\nMore\n\n\n\nWhen using the enrollment system, students may encounter holds on their records, preventing them from enrolling in classes. Holds can also prevent students from obtaining a transcript, a degree completion letter, certification of status, or a diploma. Their enrollment notification will indicate the type of hold and where it must be cleared. Hold information is also available on MyUW. Students should direct questions to the originator of the hold.\nSee Dean’s Approval, Probation\nHonors Courses\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe Graduate School does not have an honors program, and graduate students may not enroll in Honors Only courses or in Honors Optional courses for honors credit or otherwise receive honors credit for completing optional extra work in a course. If a graduate student enrolls in a mixed graduate/undergraduate course section with an Honors Optional designation, the graduate student must maintain the default “do not take with honors” selection for their enrollment. If a graduate student does select “take with Honors” as part of their enrollment for such a course, the Graduate School will remove that Honors status.\nIncompletes\n\nMore\n\n\n\nStudents who are unable to complete coursework by the end of the semester may request from the instructor the assignment of the temporary grade of “I” (Incomplete).  Students making a request for an I grade must have been carrying passing grade until near the end of the term.  If the Incomplete grade is granted the student should complete the missing work as soon as possible.  Students who receive an Incomplete grade will receive a warning message from the Graduate School, reminding them that students are not permitted to graduate with an Incomplete grade on their transcripts. Graduate students are allowed the subsequent semester of enrollment to complete the coursework before the Graduate School will place the student on academic probation. Programs may impose more stringent rules for satisfactory progress.\nIn consultation with the program, students may be dismissed from the Graduate School for failing to complete coursework and receive a final grade in a timely fashion.\nStudents with outstanding Incomplete grades may not receive  dissertator status or be granted a degree.\nIf the work is no longer relevant, the instructor of a course is no longer at the university, or a change of program makes completion of the work unnecessary, students may be allowed to receive a Permanent Incomplete (PI) for the course. The instructor of the course or their advisor submits a grade change request with an explanation or reason, changing the grade from I to PI. The Office of the Registrar also converts any incomplete grade over 5 years old to PI. Students may graduate with PI’s on their transcript.\nUnresolved Incomplete grades lapse to a grade of Permanent Incomplete (PI) after five years.\nSee Permanent Incomplete (PI) Grade, Probation, Satisfactory Progress\nIndividual Development Plan\n\nMore\n\n\n\nUW–Madison recommends all graduate students and postdoctoral researchers utilize Individual Development Plans to set academic and career goals and facilitate conversations with their mentor(s). All graduate students and postdoctoral researchers supported by NIH funding are required to have an Individual Development Plan (IDP). Other funding agencies may have additional requirements related to the IDP.\nIDPs are written plans that give mentees ownership and structure to assess their skills, interests, and values, define clear and actionable goals, explore career options, and facilitate conversations with their mentor(s). IDP forms vary greatly, although many are structured around core competencies or learning outcomes. The onus for writing, maintaining, and implementing the plan is on the mentee, and conversations with and feedback from the mentor(s) are essential.\nThe Graduate School will identify individuals who must complete an IDP and will notify them of tools and resources available. The Graduate School will offer graduate students, postdocs, and PIs tools to track IDP progress. The IDP tracking tool will log activity related to the IDP, but the actual contents of the IDP will not be captured by the tracking tool.

In order to activate medical insurance benefits, students contact their department’s/program’s benefits coordinator.\nStudents who are currently enrolled as UW–Madison students and have paid segregated fees can also use the services of University Health Services (UHS). University Health Services is the health clinic on campus, open to any current UW–Madison student (excluding guest students). UHS offers insurance through SHIP (Student Health Insurance Plan), which is located on the premises. SHIP is a comprehensive insurance plan for UW–Madison students that covers additional health care costs incurred both at UHS and elsewhere. This includes travel and meningitis immunizations, prescription drugs, and oral contraceptives at UHS as well as after hours, emergency room, hospitalization, and other specialized medical services locally and nationwide.\nFor more information or questions, contact UHS or SHIP.\nInternational students, or visiting J-1 scholars, and their visa dependents residing in the U.S. must meet the mandatory health insurance requirements of UW–Madison. International students must show compliance with these requirements by registering with the SHIP office. Students may register either by enrolling in the SHIP Health Plan or by filing a waiver application (if they satisfy the qualifying conditions). Failure to register by the specified deadlines will result in a $100 late fee in addition to any required SHIP premiums.\nPlease note: Students do not have to file a waiver if they have employment through UW–Madison and they meet all of the following conditions:\n\nThey are employed at UW–Madison and are receiving full medical benefits which were effective on or before September 1 (for fall) or February 1 (for spring/summer).\nThey are a member of one of the following health insurance plans: Group Health Cooperative, Unity Health Plans, Physicians Plus, Dean Health Care, or Standard Plan.\nThey are the primary subscriber (not a dependent) of their health insurance plan.\n\nIf a student meets all of the above criteria, the SHIP office will file an automatic waiver on his/her behalf.\nAdditional information regarding SHIP, including enrollment and waiver policies, can be found here.\nGraduate students traveling abroad for study or research are encouraged to acquire international health insurance through Cultural Insurance Services International (CISI). All University of Wisconsin students studying/traveling abroad under a UW sponsored program must enroll in health insurance through CISI). Further information about international health insurance can be found here.\nSee Benefits, Appendix 2 – Payroll Benefits\nJoint Degrees\n\nMore\n\n\n\nA joint degree consists of one graduate degree with two programs. A student completing a joint degree writes one thesis or dissertation and receives one diploma. Students can earn a joint master’s or a joint doctoral degree. Such degrees are relatively rare. Students should inquire with each program prior to enrollment to see if additional policies exist that would restrict the ability to complete a joint degree.\nTo apply for a joint degree a student must submit a proposal for the degree to the Graduate School along with an electronic Add/Change/Discontinue Program Request. A student must be admitted to the second program. An appropriate Associate Dean of the Graduate School reviews all such proposals.\nStudents must submit the proposal before they complete the coursework and no later than the beginning of their second year of graduate study.\nThe joint degree proposal must address the following issues:\n\nReasons for seeking a joint degree, rather than following the traditional program/minor curriculum (for doctoral programs that require a minor) or double degrees curriculum (for master’s programs).\nCoursework necessary to satisfy each program’s requirements; two separate course lists required.\nThe required content of each program’s portion of the degree requirements in the proposal (for example, preliminary exam arrangements for the doctoral degree or a joint thesis required for the master’s degree, etc.).\n\nTo receive a joint degree, students must:\n\nBe admitted to both programs, with approval of their proposal from both programs;\nComplete the degree requirements in each program as outlined in the proposal;\nFulfill the Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence, degree, and coursework (50%) credit requirements.\nBe recommended for the degree by the faculty co-chairs/advisors from each program and the program director from each program, approval signatures required.\n\nOnce a joint degree proposal has been reviewed and approved, any and all changes must be submitted to the Graduate School for further review.\nFor further details about joint degrees, contact the Graduate School Office of Academic Services.\nSee Double Degrees, Dual Degrees: Graduate and Professional Combination, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Special Graduate Committee Degrees, Appendix 5 – Double, Joint, and Dual Degrees at a Glance\nJury Duty\n\nMore\n\n\n\nIf a student is called to jury duty and the duty is sustained over a period of three weeks or more, the student should be allowed to withdraw from classes. If extended jury duty should continue after the last day of class, the instructor has the option of assigning an Incomplete (I) as the student’s grade. The I grade will not result in academic probation or the removal of dissertator status. Further information is available at Graduate School’s Office of Academic Services.\nLanguage Requirements\n\nMore\n\n\n\nEach program sets its own language requirements. Some programs require competence in one or more languages before students can take preliminary examinations. Students must check with their major program’s criteria for satisfactory progress in the program’s student handbook, or in the Graduate Guide.\nLate Enrollment/Late Course Change/Late Drop\n\nMore\n\n\n\nIt is a student’s responsibility to be aware of the deadlines for enrollment each term. All session deadlines are adhered to as detailed on the Office of the Registrar’s Enrollment Deadlines page.\nLate Initial Enrollment: Students have through the end of the second week to enroll in courses for fall or spring term. If students enroll after the first week of class, they are subject to late payment fees. Permission to enroll late does not excuse students from paying late initial enrollment and/or late payment penalties. Exceptions to the published deadlines will be granted only in the case of truly mitigating circumstances. Late initial enrollment cannot be completed in MyUW; a Late initial Enrollment Request Form must be submitted along with written approval from the student’s faculty advisor. Refer to the chart below for detailed steps to late initial enrollment.\nLate course changes (add a class, change credit, change sections): After deadlines have passed, late course adds can be requested by submitting a completed Late Course Add Request Form to the Graduate School. Other courses changes may be requested via the Course Change Request in MyUW. For more information, see the Registrar’s Office enrollment overview.  For all changes, the Course Change Request must be printed from MyUW and required signatures must be obtained along with written approval from the student’s faculty advisor. Refer to the chart below for detailed steps to late course changes. The Dean’s signature will be fulfilled once submitted to the Graduate School.\nLate Drop: The electronic Course Change Request process via MyUW Student Center is not accessible for late drops. Students must complete the Graduate School Late Course Drop Request Form along with written justification from the student’s faculty advisor. Please note that poor academic performance in a course is not an acceptable reason for a late drop request.  Refer to the chart below for detailed steps to late drops.\n\n\n\nAction\nWhen During the Semester\nStudent’s Process\n\n\n\n\nLate Initial Enrollment:\nAfter the 2nd week of class (fall/spring terms, different deadlines apply for summer sessions)\n\n\nStudents must fill out the Late Initial Enrollment Request Form and obtain all required signatures.\nStudents must obtain written approval from their faculty advisor.\nEmail the Late Initial Enrollment Request From and faculty advisor approval to the Graduate School at Academic Services.\n\n\n\n\nLate Course Change (Add/Change Credit/Change Section)\nAfter the 9th week of classes (fall/spring terms, different deadlines apply for summer sessions)\n\n\nFor late course adds, students must complete and submit a Late Course Add Request form.    For credit/section changes, students must complete an electronic Course Change Request in MyUW, print the form and obtain required signatures.\nStudents must obtain written approval from their faculty advisor.\nEmail the form and written approval to the Graduate School at Academic Services.\n\n\n\n\nLate Drop\nSee Registrar’s Office  Dates/Deadlines page for specific drop deadline information (fall/spring terms, different deadlines apply for summer sessions)\n\n\nStudents must fill out the Late Course Drop Form and obtain all required signatures.\nStudents must obtain written justification from their faculty advisor.\nEmail the Late Course Drop Form and written justification to the Graduate School at Academic Services.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more information about late enrollment, late course change or late drop, contact the Graduate School Office of Academic Services.\nSee Course Changes, Dean’s Approval\nLeave of Absence\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe Graduate School does not have a formal policy on leave of absence for pre-dissertators. Students should notify their graduate program of their intention to take a leave of absence.\nIf students have pre-enrolled for a future term and plan to take a leave of absence, they must be sure to drop all courses before the first day of class.\nPreviously enrolled students who wish to return to Graduate School should follow the instructions for Readmission to Graduate School. Any student who does not enroll for a fall or spring term is considered to be a reentry and must pay the Graduate School online application fee. Any student granted readmission must adhere to the most current requirements as listed in the Graduate School Academic Policies & Procedures. Master’s degree students who have been absent for five or more consecutive years lose all credits that they have earned before their absence. Doctoral degree students who have been absent for ten or more consecutive years lose all credits that they have earned before their absence. Individual programs may count the coursework students completed prior to their absence for meeting program requirements; however that coursework will not count toward Graduate School credit requirements.\nNon-dissertators: The Graduate School has no formal policy regarding a leave of absence at the pre-dissertator level, although some programs do. Therefore, it is critical that students contact their major programs before considering a break in enrollment of one or more terms.\nDissertators: A candidate for a doctoral degree should be aware that failure to take the final oral examination and submit the dissertation within 5 years after passing the preliminary examination may require another preliminary examination and admittance to candidacy a second time. In addition, the Graduate School requires all dissertators to maintain continuous enrollment. In rare circumstances when this is not possible, a degree completion fee is assessed to recognize the inevitable use of university facilities (including faculty and staff time) up to and including the successful defense of the dissertation.\nInternational Students: International students considering a leave of absence should check on their visa status with International Student Services.\nGraduate Appointments: Students with Teaching Assistantships (TA), Program Assistantships (PA), or Research Assistantships (RA) should consult with their program, their PI and/or advisor. Students with Fellowships or Traineeships should contact their funding source.\nSee Degree Completion Fee, Family Leave, International Students Maintaining Legal Status, Readmission to Graduate School (for previously enrolled graduate students), Time Limits\nMaximum Credits per Term\n\nMore\n\n\n\nNon-dissertator students are allowed to enroll for a maximum of 15 credits. The enrollment system counts all credits in determining maximum credit loads. Even though pass/fail courses, audit courses, and 100- or 200-level courses are considered undergraduate level credits, they are counted in total credit load.\nSee Enrollment Requirements\nMaximum Levels of Appointments\n\nMore\n\n\n\nUniversity policy restricts appointment levels for Project, Research, or Teaching Assistants; fellows; trainees; and university staff who are enrolled as graduate students. The levels established by the university are maximums, not minimums or expected levels.\nProject Assistant (PA) and Teaching Assistant (TA)\nAppointments exceeding 75% for domestic students are rare and require approval of the advisor and chair of the payrolling program(s), the payrolling college dean’s office(s), and the Graduate School. Some colleges, schools, or programs may set lower limits, but in general require prior specific approvals if the appointment or some combination of appointments exceeds 75%. Project Assistants may be employed 100% during summer term, semester breaks, and spring vacation. International students cannot have an appointment exceeding 50% during the spring and fall terms. International students should refer to information from International Student Services for additional appointment restrictions.\nResearch Assistant (RA)\nAppointments exceeding 50% are not permitted. Domestic students may have a combination of appointments not exceeding 75% with no more than 50% being the RA appointment. International students cannot have any combination of a RA and another appointment over 50%. International students should refer to information from International Student Services for additional appointment restrictions.\nPredoctoral Fellows/Trainees\nStudents can hold a concurrent appointment as a TA, RA, PA, or student hourly with their fellowship within the limits set out in the current university policy. Whenever assistantships (RA, TA, or PA) are combined with fellowships or traineeships, total compensation cannot exceed the full-time RA rate of the student’s academic home department, as it was reported to the Graduate School for the current year (fellowship/traineeship + assistantship = total compensation). The list of approved program rates can be found on the Graduate Assistantships webpage, under Assistantship Stipends by Program. More information about concurrent appointment policy for fellows/trainees can be found in the University of Wisconsin–Madison Policy for Supplementation and Concurrent Appointments for Graduate Students Holding Predoctoral Fellowships or Traineeships.\nLimited/Academic Staff, Non-dissertators\nCombinations of appointment percentages and academic load percentage exceeding 175% are very unusual because of the difficulty that such academic loads place on the ability of the employee to perform their responsibilities. Therefore, approval by the employing division’s dean/director (or designee) is required prior to the start of classes. The Graduate School dean should be informed in writing of any approved requests. See Chapter 11.03 of the Unclassified Personnel Policies and Procedures document for the current university policy entitled, Employees Enrolled as UW–Madison Students.\nLimited/Academic Staff, Dissertators\nCombinations of appointment percentages and academic load percentage exceeding 175% are more common because dissertators have no classes to attend. Although these are approved only at the program chair or director level, the employing unit’s dean/director (or designee) and the Dean of the Graduate School must be informed in writing of any approved requests. See Chapter 11.03 of the Unclassified Personnel Policies and Procedures document for the current university policy entitled, Employees Enrolled as UW–Madison Students.\nStudent hourly\nIn some situations it may be appropriate to hire graduate students as student hourly help. Employers should contact their Dean’s office to determine when this is appropriate. Maximum levels for appointments also include student hourly appointments. See Chapter 1.06 of the Unclassified Personnel Policies and Procedures document for the current university policy entitled, Student Hourly Help.\nFor any combination of appointments (except fellowships and traineeships), the total appointment percentage may not exceed 75%.\nA 100% academic load for graduate students is:\n\nNon-dissertators: Fall or spring terms, 8 graded credits in courses numbered 300 or above; summer sessions, 4 graded credits in courses numbered 300 or above.\nDissertators: Fall, spring, or summer, 3 graded credits numbered 300 or above.\n\nIf a student holds an assistantship concurrently with a staff appointment, the combination of appointments may not exceed 75%, regardless of the number of credits for which the student is enrolled.\nFurther information about maximum levels of appointments can be found in the University of Wisconsin–Madison Maximum Levels of Graduate Assistantship Appointments Policy\nSee Enrollment Requirements,\nMinimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe minimum graduate coursework (50%) requirement states that at least 50% of credits applied toward the program’s graduate degree credit requirement must be courses designed for graduate work (this includes but is not limited to online, thesis/research, independent study, and practicum/internship credits).  Courses taken as a University Special student are not allowed to count toward the 50% graduate coursework minimum unless taken at the 700 level or above.\nFor students taking coursework through the fall 2015 term, the official university record which identifies programs documented “graduate level” coursework is each program’s Minimum Degree Requirements and Satisfactory Progress chart in the 2014-2016 Graduate School catalog.  The official University documentation of “graduate level” coursework is identified with the graduate course attribute (G50%) in the University’s Course Guide and Class Search. More information regarding the course attribute can be found on the Academic Planning and Institutional Research (APIR) website.\nStudents should be aware that some programs may require more rigorous credit minimums than the Graduate School’s minimum. Students should visit their program’s Minimum Degree Requirements and Satisfactory Progress chart and contact their graduate program coordinator for program specific degree requirements.\nSee Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Prior Coursework, University Special Student Status, Time Limits\nMinimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe Graduate School’s minimum graduate degree credit requirement is a degree requirement instituted by the Graduate Faculty Executive Committee to ensure that a graduate degree meets institution accreditation standards (this includes but is not limited to online, thesis/research, independent study, and practicum internships credits).\nGraduate Degree Credit Minimums\nMaster’s Degree: 30 credits\n(except MFA)\nM.F.A. /Specialist Certificate: 42 credits\n(may include master’s degree credits taken at UW–Madison)\nDoctoral Degree: 51 credits\n(may include master’s degree credits taken at UW–Madison and credits take while a dissertator)\nThe doctoral degree minimum graduate degree credit requirement may be achieved with credits earned before or after dissertator status. The credits applied towards a master’s degree, a doctoral minor, or taken as a dissertator shall count towards the related doctoral graduate degree credit requirement.\nStudents should be aware that some programs may require more rigorous credit requirements than the Graduate School’s minimum requirements. Students should contact their graduate program coordinator for further information.\nSee Dissertator Status, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Prior Coursework, Time Limits\nMinimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence credit requirement for graduation can be satisfied only with courses numbered 300 and above taken as a graduate student at UW–Madison (this includes but is not limited to online, thesis/research, independent study, practicum/internship credits).\nGraduate Residence Credit Minimums:\nMaster’s degree: 16 credits\n(except MFA)\nMFA/Specialist certificate: 24 credits\n(may include Master’s degree credits taken at UW–Madison)\nDoctoral degree: 32 credits\n(must be completed prior to achieving dissertator status; may include master’s degree credits taken at UW–Madison)\nIn rare circumstances, courses taken as a University Special student maybe allowed to count toward the minimum graduate residence credit requirement. These credits generally are not allowed to count toward the 50% graduate coursework minimum.\nCredits applied to the minimum graduate residence credit requirement must be earned while enrolled as a graduate student at UW–Madison and can also count toward the minimum graduate degree credit requirement.\nStudents should be aware that some programs may require more rigorous credit requirements than the Graduate School’s minimum requirements. Students should contact their graduate program coordinator for further information.\nSee Dissertator Status, Grading System, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Pass/Fail, Prior Coursework, Progress (P) Grades, Time Limits, Traveling Scholar Program\nMinnesota/Wisconsin Reciprocity\n\nMore\n\n\n\nMinnesota residents who are certified by the Minnesota Office of Higher Education (MOHE) for the appropriate term/summer session to attend UW–Madison under the Minnesota-Wisconsin Tuition Reciprocity Agreement will be assessed the approved reciprocity tuition rate, plus the segregated fees assessed for all UW–Madison students. Students under this program will be classified as nonresidents of Wisconsin.\nStudents with a Research Assistantship (RA), that covers all instructional costs, will be billed as nonresidents, not Minnesota reciprocity rates. The end result to the student is the same, as students are only responsible for the segregated fees.\nStudents who are not certified for the program prior to the date fees are due must either pay nonresident rates and be refunded the difference in tuition upon certification by MOHE, or delay payment until certification is issued and include the $100.00 late payment fee due at that time.\nIt is the student’s responsibility to inquire of MOHE about the suitability of reapplying, application procedures, and deadlines. Questions and application requests should be directed to the Minnesota Office of Higher Education.\nMisconduct, Academic\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe university holds graduate students to a high standard of academic integrity and believes that misconduct may warrant university discipline in addition to sanctions imposed by an instructor. Graduate students who have been found by their instructors to commit academic misconduct can expect that the Office for Student Conduct and Community Standards will consider whether to impose a further disciplinary sanction of university probation, suspension, or expulsion.\nChapter 14 of the University of Wisconsin Administrative Code defines academic misconduct as follows:\nAcademic misconduct is an act in which a student:\n\nseeks to claim credit for the work or efforts of another without authorization or citation;\nuses unauthorized materials or fabricated data in any academic exercise;\nforges or falsifies academic documents or records;\nintentionally impedes or damages the academic work of others;\nengages in conduct aimed at making false representation of a student’s academic performance; or\nassists other students in any of these acts. UWS 14.03(1)\n\nExamples of academic misconduct include but are not limited to:\n\ncutting and pasting text from the Web without quotation marks or proper citation;\nparaphrasing from the Web without crediting the source;\nusing notes or a programmable calculator in an exam when such use is not allowed;\nusing another person’s ideas, words, or research and presenting it as one’s own by not properly crediting the originator;\nstealing examinations or course materials;\nchanging or creating data in a lab experiment;\naltering a transcript;\nsigning another person’s name to an attendance sheet;\nhiding a book knowing that another student needs it to prepare for an assignment;\ncollaboration that is contrary to the stated rules of the course; or\ntampering with a lab experiment or computer program of another student.\n\nThe full text of the state statute governing academic misconduct, University of Wisconsin System (UWS) 14, Student Academic Disciplinary Procedures, as well as the UW–campus procedures for implementing the provisions of UWS 14 and general information about academic misconduct, are available here or from the Division of Student Life.\nMisconduct, Non-Academic\n\nMore\n\n\n\nChapter 17 of the University of Wisconsin Administrative Code describes non-academic misconduct as follows:\nThe university may discipline a student in non-academic matters in the following situations:\n\nfor conduct which constitutes a serious danger to the personal safety of a member of the university community or guest;\nfor stalking or harassment;\nfor conduct that seriously damages or destroys university property or attempts to damage or destroy university property, or the property of a member of the university community or guest;\nfor conduct that obstructs or seriously impairs university-run or university-authorized activities, or that interferes with or impedes the ability of a member of the university community, or guest, to participate in university-run or university-authorized activities;\nfor unauthorized possession of university property or property of another member of the university community or guest;\nfor acts which violate the provisions of UWS 18, Conduct on University Lands;\nfor knowingly making a false statement to any university employee or agent on a university-related matter, or for refusing to identify oneself to such employee or agent;\nfor violating a standard of conduct, or other requirement or restriction imposed in connection with disciplinary action.\n\nExamples of non-academic misconduct include but are not limited to:\n\nengaging in conduct that is a crime involving danger to property or persons, as defined in UWS 18.06(22)(d);\nattacking or otherwise physically abusing, threatening to physically injure, or physically intimidating a member of the university community or a guest;\nattacking or throwing rocks or other dangerous objects at law enforcement personnel, or inciting others to do so;\nselling or delivering a controlled substance, as defined in 161 Wis. Stats., or possessing a controlled substance with intent to sell or deliver;\nremoving, tampering with, or otherwise rendering useless university equipment or property intended for use in preserving or protecting the safety of members of the university community, such as fire alarms, fire extinguisher, fire exit signs, first aid equipment, or emergency telephones; or obstructing fire escape routes;\npreventing or blocking physical entry to or exit from a university building, corridor, or room;\nengaging in shouted interruptions, whistling, or similar means of interfering with a classroom presentation or a university-sponsored speech or program;\nobstructing a university officer or employee engaged in the lawful performance of duties;\nobstructing or interfering with a student engaged in attending classes or participating in university-run or university-authorized activities;\nknowingly disrupting access to university computing resources or misusing university computing resources.\n\nThe full text of the state statute governing non-academic misconduct, UWS 17, Student Non-Academic Misconduct Disciplinary Procedures, as well as the UW campus procedures for implementing the provisions of UWS 17 and general information about non-academic misconduct, are available here or from the Division of Student Life.\nNo Report (NR) Grades\n\nMore\n\n\n\nA No Report (NR) grade on a student’s record indicates that the instructor for the course has not yet submitted a final grade for the student’s work at the end of the grading period. This grade is not the same as an Incomplete (I), which indicates that the student’s work was unfinished at the end of the term.\nAll grades for 790, 890, 990 that are unreported (previously assigned an NR) by the end of the grading period will be automatically assigned a P (Progress). The P grades will automatically revert to S grades upon assignment of the grade for the final semester of enrollment in the course. If the instructors had intended a different grade (S, U, or I), they would need to use the electronic grade change process.\nSee Grading System, Incomplete Grades, Progress (P) Grades, Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) Grades\nOverloads\n\nMore\n\n\n\nStudents are allowed to enroll for a maximum of 15 credits during fall and spring. Summer maximum enrollment is 12 credits. Credits included are those courses numbered 300 or above, taken for a grade (not including audits and pass/fail).\nDissertators are not eligible for overloads in the fall or spring terms. However, in the summer, a dissertator who is enrolled in the general 8-week session for 3 credits may request an overload for 1-2 additional credits in a short session and still retain dissertator status.  For such requests to be approved, the course must be related to dissertation research or professional training that is not offered in regular semesters. Faculty advisors can request an overload exception for summer from the Graduate School Degree Coordinator.\nThe enrollment system counts all credits in determining maximum credit loads. An overload request is required if a student wishes to exceed the maximum number of credits they are allowed as a graduate student. Even though pass/fail courses, audit courses, and 100- or 200-level courses are not considered graduate level credits, they are counted in a total credit load. An overload request is also required if the number of credits exceeds the span of weeks in any short session during the summer (but not for a dissertator).\nIf a student wishes to enroll for more than the maximum credit load, they must submit a Credit Overload Request form, signed by their advisor, to the Graduate School Office of Academic Services. The Graduate School will look closely at the rationale for the request, the student’s course load, satisfactory progress, and assistantships. Overloads to 16-17 credits during the fall and spring semesters are generally allowed. Overloads to 18 credits are only approved for fall/spring if some of the credits are taken in a short term prior to or during the semester  If the Graduate School approves the overload, the student will then be allowed to add the course.\nSee Enrollment Requirements, Maximum Levels of Appointments\nPass/Fail Courses\n\nMore\n\n\n\nPass/fail courses do not satisfy any Graduate School credit, coursework, or degree requirements, nor do they fulfill minimum or maximum credits required each term. Tuition is still charged for pass/fail course. For these reasons, very few graduate students choose pass/fail for courses numbered 300 or above. Seminars, independent study, and research may not be taken pass/fail. The pass/fail option is not to be confused with the S/U grading option.\nStudents requesting to enroll in a course as pass/fail must first enroll or be enrolled in the course.  The request is made via the MyUW Student Center by submitting an online Course Change Request, changing the course to pass/fail. After the student requests this change online via MyUW Student Center, they submit the pass/fail form to the Graduate School either electronically at gsacserv@grad.wisc.edu or in person in room 217 Bascom Hall where it is reviewed and approved by the Graduate School.  The deadline to request/cancel pass/fail is the drop deadline, which is the end of the 9th week of class during the fall and spring semester. Requests for late pass/fail will not be considered. Specific deadline dates, including those for summer sessions, are posted prior to each semester by the Office of the Registrar.\nThe instructor does not know that a student is taking the course on a pass/fail basis and therefore reports a letter grade for the course. The Registrar records a grade of S in place of the instructors’ grades of A, AB, B, BC, or C; and a grade of U in place of D or F grades. Neither the S nor the U are computed in the graduate grade-point average.\nThe enrollment system counts all credits in determining maximum credit loads. A Credit Overload Request is required if a student’s total credit load exceeds the maximum limit per term.\nSee Dean’s Approval, Enrollment Requirements, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Overloads, Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) Grades\nPayroll Benefits for Graduate Assistants, Fellows, and Trainees\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFellow\nTrainee\nResearch Assistant\nProject Assistant\nTeaching Assistant\n\n\n\n\nSubject to State and Federal Income Taxes\nyes1\nyes1\nyes\nyes\nyes\n\n\nWithholding\nno2\nno2\nyes\nyes\nyes\n\n\nSubject to FICA Tax\nno\nno\nno3\nno3\nno3\n\n\nW2\nno4\nno4\nyes\nyes\nyes\n\n\nHealth Insurance (if at least 33% time appointment or an equivalent*)\nyes\nyes\nyes\nyes\nyes\n\n\nRemission of nonresident portion of tuition (if at least 33% time appointment or an equivalent*)\nyes\nno\nyes, unless student is enrolled in a service-based pricing program5\nyes, unless student is enrolled in a service-based pricing program5\nyes, unless student is enrolled in a service-based pricing program5\n\n\nRemission of resident portion of tuition (if at least 33% time appointment or an equivalent*)\nno\nno\nyes6, unless student is enrolled in a service-based pricing program5\nyes6, unless student is enrolled in a service-based pricing program5\nyes6, unless student is enrolled in a service-based pricing program5\n\n\nVacation\nno\nvaries\nyes\nyes\nno\n\n\nSick Leave\nno\nvaries\nyes\nyes\nyes\n\n\n\n1 May deduct tuition, fees, and books from stipends when calculating taxable income.\n2 Except international students.

The instructor of the course or their advisor submits a grade change request with an explanation or reason, changing the grade from I to PI. The Office of the Registrar also converts any incomplete grade over 5 years old to PI. Students may graduate with PI’s on their transcript.\nSee Incomplete Grades\nPortal (MyGradPortal)\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe Graduate Portal is an online resource for students and graduate coordinators. Students use the Portal to complete academic actions such as adding or changing their major, discovering professional development opportunities, and submitting payment for the completion of their doctoral degrees. Graduate Coordinators request degree warrants (master’s, preliminary exams, and doctoral) through the Portal.  Students should spend time becoming familiar with the Portal and its features.\nAccessing MyUW and the Graduate Student Portal\n\nGo to wisc.edu and open your MyUW in the top red banner. Then click on MyUW Home.\nEnter your NetID login information.\nClick on the tile “Graduate Student Portal”. If you do not see the tile, you can search for it in the top search bar and add it to your page.\n\nInitiating a request in the Portal\n\nOnce in your Portal page, select the tile on the home page titled “Add/Change Programs.”\nIn the “Enrolled Programs” section, you will have options to add a Graduate/Professional certificate, doctoral minor (PhD students only), or major. You also have the option to discontinue a program in which you are already enrolled.\n\nChoosing an action button will display an associated window, which will show fields appropriate for the type of request.\nPreliminary Examinations\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe preliminary examination is a significant milestone in a doctoral student’s academic career. It is given to assess knowledge of areas within the academic discipline. Passing of the preliminary area exam, obtaining approval of the minor if the major program requires it, and completing all the major course requirements culminate in admission to candidacy for the doctoral degree.\nStudents’ eligibility to take the prelim examination(s) is determined by their program. The program notifies the Graduate School of a student’s admission to candidacy on the preliminary warrant, which must be requested 3 weeks prior to the exam date. The number of examinations and their content vary from program to program. A student’s program administers the examination(s).\nAfter passing the preliminary examination, students have 5 years to take the final examination (i.e. dissertation defense) and deposit their dissertation. The 5-year clock starts on the first day of instruction of the term (Fall, Spring, or Summer) immediately following the completion of the preliminary examination. Failure to complete their degree within this period may result in students having to retake the preliminary examination and be re-admitted to candidacy.\nTime limit extension for dissertators impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic\nTo offer flexibility amidst the major disruption that COVID-19 may have had on doctoral candidates’ research and scholarship progress, students who achieved dissertator status by the end of the 2020 summer term have automatically had the 5-year time limit extended by 8 months. Dissertators given this 8-month extension who need more time due to continued COVID-related disruption to their progress may request a further extension from the Graduate School. Decisions to extend the deadline beyond the additional 8 months are made on a case-by-case basis upon request of the student and approval of their advisor. Upon advisor approval, the advisor then requests an extension from the Graduate School by submitting the request to the PhD degree coordinator at gsacserv@grad.wisc.edu.\nSee Certificate of Doctoral Candidacy, Dissertator Status, Time Limits, Warrants\nPrior Coursework\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe Graduate School does not transfer credits for previous coursework.  However, a student’s program may decide to accept coursework completed outside of the student’s graduate career at UW–Madison under the conditions detailed below.  Any prior coursework accepted under these parameters must have been rigorous and meet the expectations of a graduate work for the degree. Coursework earned five or more years prior to admission to a master’s degree or coursework earned ten or more years prior to admission to a doctoral degree is not allowed to satisfy requirements.\nSatisfying Requirements with Prior Graduate Coursework from Other Institutions\nA student’s program may decide to accept graduate coursework completed at another institution (earned post-baccalaureate) toward fulfillment of minimum degree, minimum graduate coursework, and minor credit requirements. This work will not appear on a UW–Madison transcript nor count towards the graduate career GPA. The Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence credit requirement can be satisfied only with courses taken as a graduate student at UW–Madison. The only exception is graduate-level coursework taken as a Big Ten Academic Alliance Traveling Scholar.\nSatisfying Requirements with Coursework from Undergraduate Career at UW–Madison\nFor well-prepared advanced students, a student’s program may decide to accept up to seven credits numbered 300 or above of required or elective courses from the undergraduate work completed at UW–Madison towards fulfillment of minimum degree and minor credit requirements. However, this work would not be allowed to count toward the 50% graduate coursework minimum unless taken at the 700 level or above. This work will not appear on the graduate career portion of UW–Madison transcript nor count towards the graduate career GPA. The Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence credit requirement can be satisfied only with courses taken as a graduate student at UW–Madison.\nSatisfying Requirements with Coursework from Undergraduate Career outside of UW-Madison (Policy on Exceptions for Specialized Accreditation to Allow Undergraduate Credits Towards a Graduate Degree) \nWhen considering the undergraduate category of prior coursework, the Graduate Faculty Executive Committee (GFEC) restricts the seven credits of undergraduate work to UW-Madison courses because of the challenges associated with assessing the rigor of courses taught at other institutions.\nAccredited programs may request an exception to this policy to allow up to seven credits of undergraduate coursework from other institutions to count toward a graduate degree based on specialized accreditation.  The process for requesting an exception was approved by the GFEC in 2014 and is as follows in italics:\nAn exception to allow up to seven credits from an undergraduate degree earned at a non UW- Madison institution to count toward a UW-Madison graduate degree can be requested on a program-by-program basis when the following two conditions are met:\n1) students have received their undergraduate degree in the same discipline as they are pursuing graduate work, and \n2) the undergraduate degree has been granted from a program which is accredited by the same accrediting body as the UW-Madison program.\nShould a program decide to request an exception to this policy, it must provide the Graduate School with information requested on the undergraduate credit exception form to be eligible for consideration. Please note submission of an exception request does not provide assurance of its approval.\nIf a program believes a student situation meets these criteria, it must request this exception by completing the steps as outlined in the undergraduate credit exception form.  A request may be made at any time, but please note that the earliest date for implementation is the term AFTER Graduate School approval.  Please direct any questions to Emily Reynolds at emily.reynolds@wisc.edu.\nTransfer from University Special Student Career at UW–Madison\nAfter admission to a graduate program, the student’s program may decide to accept up to fifteen University Special student credits as fulfillment of the minimum graduate residence, graduate degree, or minor credit requirements on occasion as an exception (on a case-by-case basis). In all these cases, the student would have to pay the difference in tuition for the terms in question. Those credits earned in a University Special student semester still appear in the transcript history as “University Special” student, but the Registrar’s Office will add a statement in the beginning of the transcript “All credits taken in [term] as a University Special student have been accepted by the Graduate School toward a degree program” after the student has paid the difference in tuition. UW–Madison coursework taken as a University Special student would not be allowed to count toward the 50% graduate coursework minimum unless taken at the 700 level or above. This work will not appear on the graduate career portion of the UW–Madison transcript nor count towards the graduate career GPA.\n\n\n\n\n**Prior Graduate Coursework from Other Institution(s)\n** Coursework from Undergraduate Career at UW–Madison (up to 7 credits total)\n**Transfer from University Special Student Career at UW–Madison (up to 15 credits total)\n\n\nMinimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement\nNo\nNo\n*Allowed up to 15 credits numbered 300 or above\n\n\nMinimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement\n*Allowed\n*Allowed up to 7 credits numbered 300 or above\n *Allowed up to 15 credits numbered 300 or above\n\n\nMinimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement\n*Allowed\n*Allowed up to 7 credits numbered 700 or above\n*Allowed up to 15 credits numbered 700 or above\n\n\n\n*Fulfillment of requirements is allowed in these instances only if approved by the student’s graduate program.\n**Coursework earned five or more years prior to admission to a master’s degree or coursework earned ten or more years prior to admission to a doctoral degree is not allowed to satisfy requirements.\nPrograms may decide to count previous graduate work from another institute toward fulfillment of degree credit requirements; however, this work will not appear on a UW–Madison transcript, and it does not count toward the Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence credit or graduate coursework (50%) requirements.\nPrior coursework can be used toward the minor requirement in accordance with the Prior Coursework policy chart.\nThe credits used towards a master’s degree and the prior coursework used toward it may also be applied to a related doctoral degree. However, if the prior coursework credit maximums were already reached for the master’s degree (seven UW–Madison undergraduate credits and/or fifteen University Special student credits), then no more prior coursework credits are permissible for the doctoral degree.\nStudents should be aware that some programs may require more rigorous credit requirements than the Graduate School’s minimum requirements. Students should contact their graduate program coordinator for further information.\nSee Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement\nProbation\n\nMore\n\n\n\nStudents must be in good academic standing with the Graduate School, their program, and their advisor. The Graduate School regularly reviews the record of any student who received grades of BC, C, D, F, or I in courses numbered 300 or above, or grades of U in research and thesis. This review could result in academic probation with a hold on future enrollment, and the student may be suspended from graduate studies.\nThe Graduate School requires that students maintain a minimum graduate GPA of 3.00 in courses taken as a graduate student (excluding research, audit, credit/no credit, and pass/fail courses). The Graduate School also considers Incomplete (I) grades to be unsatisfactory if they are not removed during the subsequent semester of enrollment; however, the instructor may impose an earlier deadline. The Graduate School may also put students on probation for incompletes not cleared within one term. All incomplete grades must be resolved before a degree is granted.\nIf students were admitted on probation and they satisfy the conditions outlined at the time of admission, probationary status will be removed automatically. Once their studies have begun, students are expected to make satisfactory progress toward their degree.\nSee Grade Point Average (GPA) Requirement, Holds, Incompletes, Satisfactory Progress, Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) Grades\nPrograms (or ‘Majors’)\n\nMore\n\n\n\nPrograms are officially approved courses of study and research leading to a master’s or doctoral degree. They may be administered from within a disciplinary department or across departments by an interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary cluster of faculty. Some programs have official areas of concentration within them (called Named Options or Subplans) at the master’s and/or doctoral levels. Both programs and named options appear on the student’s transcript. Some programs have unofficial tracks, specializations, or concentrations but these are not listed on the transcript. Contact the program’s graduate coordinator for more information.\nStudents who would like to pursue an individual program different from approved programs should see Special Graduate Committee Degrees.\nSee Applying to Add/Change Program, Plan, Certificate or Named Option, Change of Degree Level (Plan) or Degree Named Option (Sub-Major), Doctoral Minors, Special Graduate Committee Degrees\nProgress (P) Grades\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe P is an abbreviation for “Progress,” not an abbreviation for “Pass.” It is a temporary grade. Grades of P (except for research and thesis within the program) must be changed before a degree or preliminary exam warrant can be issued.\nIf a P is assigned for research courses numbered 790, 890, and 990, the grade will remain until the faculty member assigns a grade of S or U. All previously assigned P grades in that instructor’s research course will revert to an S or U upon assignment of the S or U grade. Usually this is upon assignment of the final grade for the course in the semester of submitting the dissertation. (All grades for 790, 890, 990 that are unreported by the end of the grading period will be automatically assigned a P.)\nSee Grading System, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, No Report (NR) Grades\nProject or Program Assistant (PA)\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThese titles designate graduate or professional students employed to assist with research, training, or other academic programs or projects. Contact the employing department directly for more information.\nThe Graduate Assistant Policies and Procedures (GAPP) outline employment-related practices for graduate student project assistants.\nSee Concurrent Appointments for Fellows/Trainees, Enrollment Requirements, Maximum Levels of Appointments, Tuition Remission, Payroll Benefits for Graduate Assistants, Fellows, and Trainees\nQualifying Examination\n\nMore\n\n\n\nQualifying examination requirements differ for each program. Students should contact their program to learn about specific requirements.\nSee Preliminary Examinations\nReadmission to Graduate School (for previously enrolled graduate students)\n\nMore\n\n\n\nIf graduate students do not continuously enroll during a fall or spring semester, they are required to apply for readmission to the Graduate School through the online application. The readmission process accomplishes two goals: (1) assures the Graduate School that graduate students are in good standing with their academic program; and (2) activates their enrollment eligibility. Further information about readmission for previously enrolled graduate students can be found here. To apply for readmission, graduate students must also contact their program for further details of the readmission process at the program level.\nA returning student who is completing another same level degree within five years must comply with double degree requirements, including the 25% overlap rule.\nAny student being readmitted to a graduate program must adhere to the requirements in the most current Academic Policies & Procedures and Graduate Guide.\nSee Double Degrees, Effective Dates, International Students Maintaining Legal Status, Leave of Absence, Time Limits\nRepeating Courses\n\nMore\n\n\n\nTypically, courses where content can change (such as special topics, seminars, independent studies, and research and thesis) can be repeated within the semester or on a semester basis. Repeated courses may earn course credit and satisfy the Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence, degree, and coursework (50%) credit requirements. Sometimes program authorization is necessary for enrollment.\nStudents are entitled to repeat any didactic course if they or their program feel it is necessary. Both grades will be used in calculating the student’s graduate grade-point average; however, the course will count only once toward the Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence, degree, and coursework (50%) credit requirements.\nSee Failure, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Satisfactory Progress, Appendix 4 – Grade-Point Average Calculation\nResearch Assistant (RA)\n\nMore\n\n\n\nA Research Assistant (RA) must be a graduate student working toward a master’s or doctoral degree. Research Assistants are UW–Madison graduate students who are given stipends to support their own education and training. RAs should not be given work assignments unrelated to their own educational pursuits – graduate assistants with significant duties unrelated to their own course of study should be appointed as a PA rather than an RA.\nThe program will give consideration for an RA appointment based on information provided in the application for admission or, in some cases, in a specific program application form. Research Assistants will receive a letter of appointment or reappointment each semester or year they hold their assistantship. If appointed students have not received such a letter, they should contact their payrolling office.\nNote that the RA appointment percentage is merely a mechanism for setting the stipend amount, and does not correlate to any particular requirement for hours of work. The maximum appointment percentage is 50%. However, to account for the potential that RAs may occasionally perform duties that are not directly related to their course of study, the university has deemed an RA appointment to entail 5 hours of compensated employment per week. In no event may an RA be asked to perform more than 5 hours per week of work unrelated to their course of study, regardless of percentage of RA appointment.\nThe Graduate Assistant Policies and Procedures (GAPP) outline employment-related practices for graduate student research assistants.\nSee Enrollment Requirements, Maximum Levels of Appointments\nResidence for Tuition Purposes\n\nMore\n\n\n\nWisconsin Statute 36.27(2) governs resident status for tuition purposes. To be eligible for in-state tuition, a student must be a bona fide resident of Wisconsin for at least the 12 months immediately prior to enrollment, or must qualify as a resident for tuition purposes under one of the provisions in the Statutes that waives the 12-month requirement. In determining resident status for tuition purposes, standards are different from those used for voting, paying taxes, etc.\nIf students are classified as nonresident for tuition purposes, they do not automatically become residents for tuition purposes after residing in Wisconsin for one or more years. In cases where it appears the students have entered and remained in Wisconsin principally for educational purposes, a presumption is made that they continue to reside outside the state. The presumption of non-residence continues in effect until rebutted by clear and convincing evidence of bona fide residence.\nProvisions of the statute under which a student may qualify as a resident for tuition purposes without waiting 12 months are:\n\nThe student is a graduate of a Wisconsin high school and has a parent who has been a bona fide resident of Wisconsin for the 12 months preceding the beginning of any term of enrollment or whose last surviving parent was a bona fide resident of this state for the 12 months preceding death;\nThe student, a spouse, or parent (of which they are claimed as a tax dependent), has moved to Wisconsin for a job transfer or for new employment that was accepted before moving and before the student applied to this university. The employment needs to continue full-time with the same employer, and the student needs to demonstrate an intent to establish and maintain their permanent home in Wisconsin;\nOne of the student’s parents is a bona fide resident of Wisconsin, and the student is a tax dependent of one of the parents.\n\nFind more information about residence for tuition purposes and the full text of the applicable statute on the Office of the Registrar’s Residence for Tuition Purposes webpage. Students with questions about residence for tuition purposes, or who believe they should be a resident and would like to appeal the nonresident tuition status, may contact the Office of the Registrar’s Residence Counselors.\nResponsible Conduct of Research\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe various areas of responsible conduct of research and associated policies are described below. For more information, see this comprehensive document regarding UW–Madison Research Safety and Compliance Training Requirements and the Research Policy and Compliance Checklist.\nAnimal Care and Use in Research\nUW–Madison has federal compliance responsibilities that pertain to the use of live, vertebrate animals in research, teaching, and outreach activities. This includes but is not limited to traditional basic and applied research models, instruction of students, and public events. Oversight and evaluation of the humane and ethical use of animals is performed by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUCs). The Research Animal Resource Center (RARC) provides support to the IACUCs and training to animal users necessary to provide the highest quality care and compliance for the university’s research animals. Learn more about the rules and regulations governing the care and use of research animals, how to prepare and submit animal care and use protocols to IACUCs, and how to obtain veterinary and pathology services at the Research Animal Resources Center webpage. Training and protocol approval are required before one can begin research projects involving animals.\nAuthorship\nAuthors of a research publication are usually those who provide meaningful intellectual contribution to a project in one or more of the following ways: concept, design, supervision, resources, materials, data collection and processing, analysis or interpretation, literature search and writing. Many academic journals may list very specific requirements for authorship. All authors have rights and responsibilities thus any person listed as an author should be knowledgeable and aware of such. Unless the contributions of the co-authors are listed, each author takes full responsibility for the contents of the work. When asked to serve as a publication reviewer, students should treat this material as confidential. See further information about authorship, publication and peer review.\nConflict of Interest\nThe Conflict of Interest (COI) staff and committee review reports of outside activities and financial interests to comply with federal, state, and university regulations and policies. This committee also works with faculty and staff to eliminate, minimize, or manage any actual or potential financial conflicts of interest identified by the reporting process. For further information see the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research’s Conflict of Interest guidance document and Outside Activities Reporting webpage.\nHuman Research Protections\nIn accordance with federal regulations and UW–Madison policies, all research involving human subjects must be reviewed and approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) prior to any research intervention with participants. All graduate research involving human subjects for inclusion in a master’s thesis or doctoral dissertation must be approved by an IRB before beginning the research. Training is required before a project is submitted to an IRB for review. For additional information, see the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research Human Research Protection Program webpage. For additional information visit the Institutional Review Board webpage.\nIntellectual Property Rights\nExcept as required by funding agreements or other university policies, the university does not claim ownership rights in the intellectual property generated during research by its faculty, staff, or students. This policy has proven beneficial to the university, the public, and the creators of such property. In the case of inventions funded in whole or in part by a federal agency or in the case of sponsored research agreements that require the university to grant rights in inventions generated by funding under such agreements, faculty, staff, and students must assign rights to such invention to the university’s designated patent management organization, the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF). Faculty, staff, and students must execute all papers necessary to file patent applications on the invention and establish the federal government’s or other sponsor’s rights in the invention. If there are no specific written agreements or policies to the contrary, the researcher at the university is free to dispose of the rights in the manner of his or her own choosing. The university retains the right to use the products of research conducted as a university activity for its education and research mission. See information and forms for disclosing an invention or read more about intellectual property.\nMisconduct of Research\nGraduate education is carried in classrooms, laboratories and other research venues, and is often supported by federal or other external funding sources. Maintaining the integrity of academic and research efforts carried out at UW–Madison is an essential priority. At UW–Madison, graduate students are held to the same standards of responsible conduct of research as faculty and staff. Misconduct in scholarly research is defined as fabrication (making up data), falsification (changing or misreporting data), plagiarism (representing work of others as your own), or other practices that seriously deviate from those that are commonly accepted within the scholarly community for proposing, conducting, or reporting research. For more information, see the overview of Misconduct in Scholarly Research and Faculty Legislation II-314: Misconduct in Scholarly Research. The Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research is responsible for investigating allegations of research misconduct. For more information, contact the Associate Vice Chancellor for Research Policy and Integrity.\nReporting Wrongdoing, Non-compliance or Research Misconduct\nThe University of Wisconsin-Madison strives to foster the highest scholarly and ethical standards among its students, faculty, and staff. As a recipient of federal funding, the University of Wisconsin must comply with federal laws related to civil rights, animal welfare research misconduct, and others. Though extremely rare, we realize there are times when reportable events of wrongdoing, noncompliance, or misconduct may occur in our midst and that it is our responsibility as an academic community to take steps to rectify them. See the Whistleblower Protection Policy and the policy on Obligations and Protections for Graduate Students.\nPatents\nA patent is an exclusive statutory right available to the inventor or inventors of new material. As inventors, students may have the right to seek patent protection for their invention (for example, for a product that results from the research documented in their dissertation).\nIf students have received support (for example, an appointment as a Research Assistant or Project Assistant) for the work leading to an invention, or used any other university funding, supplies, equipment, or university premises, in the work leading to an invention, they may have obligations that affect their rights to seek patent protection for an invention. It is important to discuss patents with their advisor. Also, students should review the Intellectual Property Policy for Research.\nResearch Regulatory Compliance\nIf students’ research involves human subjects (including data sets, surveys, human blood, or other body materials), live animals, recombinant DNA, infectious agents, stem cells, or biological toxins, they should consult the Research Ethics webpage.\nSafety\nBiological Safety\nThe Office of Biological Safety (OBS) assists faculty, students, and staff in observing safe practices in research in the biological sciences as prescribed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and endeavors to ensure that research is done in secure facilities in compliance with all local, state, and federal regulations. As an institution receiving NIH research funds, UW–Madison is subject to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules (rDNA). OBS provides the administrative mechanism by which research involving rDNA can be reviewed, thereby assuring compliance with the NIH guidelines. This institution adheres to the guidance of the CDC/NIH publication, Biosafety in Biomedical and Microbiological Laboratories. Institutional policies are described in the UW–Madison Researchers’ Biosafety Manual.\nChemical Safety\nThe UW–Madison Chemical Safety Office, working in conjunction with the campus Chemical Safety Committee, establishes policies and procedures for the safe acquisition, use, storage, and disposal of chemicals on campus. The Chemical Safety Office also advises campus chemical users on best practices and helps the university community comply with federal, state, and local chemical and environmental safety laws. See the Office of Chemical Safety website for additional information.\nRadiation Safety\nThe UW–Madison Office of Radiation Safety provides training on the safe use and handling of radioactive materials, which includes ordering, use, disposal, spill cleanup, and shipping for those employees who will need to ship radioactive materials. The Office of Radiation Safety also provides shielding assessments and dosimetry to those users who require it. Additionally, training on safe use of x-ray generating equipment and lasers is also available. See the Office of Radiation Safety website for additional information.\nSatisfactory Academic Progress\n\nMore\n\n\n\nContinuation in the Graduate School is at the discretion of a student’s program, the Graduate School, and a student’s faculty advisor.  A student may be placed on probation or dismissed from the Graduate School for not maintaining satisfactory academic progress.  In special cases the Graduate School permits students who do not meet these minimum standards to continue on probation upon recommendation and support of their advisor.\nThe Graduate School sets minimum standards that all graduate students in the university must meet. Many departments and programs have additional requirements that exceed these Graduate School minimum requirements. The definition of satisfactory progress varies by program.\nMost programs require satisfactory progress to continue guaranteed funding support.\nThe Graduate Guide includes the Graduate School’s minimum degree requirements and satisfactory progress chart, as well as each program’s minimum degree requirements and satisfactory progress chart.\nIn determining satisfactory academic progress, the Graduate School monitors the following: cumulative grade point average, incomplete grades, English as a second language for some international students, the grades of students admitted on probationary status, enrollment in minimum required credits (underload), and unsatisfactory (U) grades.  Detailed information for each is below.\nLow cumulative GPA\nGraduate students must meet the Graduate School’s minimum 3.0 cumulative GPA in order to graduate. Some probationary admission conditions may require higher grades. When a graduate student’s cumulative GPA drops below a 3.0 for one semester, we notify them via email (copy to grad coordinator) that they are placed on academic probation, and we place a GSD LGR enrollment hold on the following semester. They cannot continue enrolling until the probationary semester’s grades are reported and their cumulative GPA is above a 3.0.\nIf a student is placed on probation due to low GPA, they receive an email notification with the graduate coordinator copied.\nIncomplete (I) grades\nIf graduate students have not resolved incompletes by the end of the subsequent semester of enrollment, these grades are considered unsatisfactory. Graduate students are not permitted to graduate with incomplete grades on their record. The Graduate School issues warnings for incompletes that have not yet lapsed into bad standing, and for three or less credits of incompletes. The Graduate School places student on academic probation for having more than three credits of incompletes in bad standing and uses the GSD INC service indicator (enrollment hold) to ensure that this requirement is met before continued enrollment is permitted.\nIf a student is placed on probation due to incompletes, he/she receives an email notification with the graduate coordinator copied.\nESL required at admission to the Graduate School\nInternational graduate students may be required to take the ESLAT upon arrival at UW-Madison. This requirement applies to the following test scores: TOEFL (paper-based) test score is below 580; TOEFL computer based test (CBT) score below 237; (TOEFL internet based iBT) test score below 92; IELTS score below 7; or MELAB below 82. The ESLAT is administered by the English as a Second Language Program (Sandy Arfa, Director). ESLAT results may indicate that a graduate student is exempt from taking an ESL course, or these results may indicate a recommended ESL course. Graduate students for whom the ESLAT was required and who are not exempt based on the test results must enroll in the recommended ESL course during their first semester at UW-Madison. The Graduate School monitors successful completion of the ESL course for these students. The GSD ESL service indicator (enrollment hold) ensures that this requirement is met before continued enrollment is permitted.\nAdmit on probation\nApplicants who do not meet Graduate School admissions requirements may be admitted on probation, with program recommendation and GS Dean’s approval. They are admitted as G17 or G18 (probationary admit) codes, and receive an admission letter from the Graduate School, as well as message in OASIS, that notifies them they are being admitted on probation. These cases are monitored closely to ensure that the students achieve a 3.0 GPA during their first semester of enrollment. A hold is placed (GSD ADT), which prohibits them from enrolling in the following semester classes until their first semester grades are reported and the GPA is above a 3.0.\nUnderload (1 credit)\nGraduate students are required to enroll in a minimum of 2 graded, graduate-level credits each fall and spring semester. Those who are enrolled in only 1 credit each fall and spring semester are notified by the GS that they are under-enrolled. They are required to correct their enrollment immediately, and a GSD UNL hold is placed on their record, prohibiting them from enrolling in the subsequent term, until they meet the minimum enrollment requirement.\nUnsatisfactory (U) grades\nIf a course has been structured to offer the S/U grading option (such as research), a grade of S in that course would mean a grade of B or better. The Graduate School monitors U grades. Since these grades are very rare, cases are handled individually. Upon identification of a graduate student with a U grade in research, we contact the faculty advisor to find out more about the situation. GSD LGR holds are not automatically placed for U grades but may be if necessary.\n \n \nSee Grade Point Average (GPA) Requirement, Incompletes, Probation\nSatisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) Grades\n\nMore\n\n\n\nFor all courses listed as research, the only permissible grades are Satisfactory (S), Unsatisfactory (U), and Progress (P). Though an Incomplete (I) grade may be assigned, a final grade must be submitted during the following term. If a P grade is assigned, it will remain until the instructor assigns a grade of S or U; all previously assigned P grades should revert to an S or U upon assignment of the final grade in most cases. These courses will not count in the student’s graduate Grade Point Average (GPA).\nResearch courses are traditionally reserved for graduate students; however, other students (Law, Medical, Undergraduate, etc.) occasionally register for a research course. In these cases the student’s college can decide to have the course count in the GPA with an academic action to the Registrar’s Office.\nIf a course has been structured to offer the S/U grading option, a grade of S in that course would mean a grade of B or better. S/U courses are not computed into the grade-point average. They may however satisfy the Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence, degree, and coursework (50%) credit requirements as well as the minor course credit and in considering the minimum or maximum credit load per term. The S/U grading option is not to be confused with the pass/fail option. Unsatisfactory grades do not satisfy any Graduate School’s minimum credit requirements. Programs and the Graduate School monitor students for unsatisfactory grades. Advisor holds may be placed for students with unsatisfactory grades.\nThe use of letter grades (A through F) is encouraged and recommended whenever information on performance permits. Courses designated as research require grading on the S/U basis. In certain seminars and advanced topics courses, where lack of examinations and other performance criteria makes the A-F scale inappropriate, use of the S/U option is permissible.\nSee Grade Point Average (GPA) Requirement, Incompletes, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Pass/Fail, Probation, Progress (P) Grades\nSchedule of Classes\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe Schedule of Classes is available on the Course Search and Enroll App, and students can access the Schedule of Classes via their MyUW Student Center. The Schedule of Classes can be viewed using class search, the real-time online listing of course sections offered each term. Students are responsible for complying with enrollment deadlines, available at the Office of the Registrar’s Enrollment Deadlines.\nSee Authorization for Courses, Enrollment Accountability\nSchools and Colleges, Graduate Degrees\n\nMore\n\n\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin–Madison Schools and Colleges\nCollege of Agricultural and Life Sciences\nWisconsin School of Business\nSchool of Education\nCollege of Engineering\nGraduate School\nSchool of Human Ecology\nLaw School\nCollege of Letters and Science\nSchool of Medicine and Public Health\nSchool of Nursing\nNelson Institute for Environmental Studies\nSchool of Pharmacy\nSchool of Veterinary Medicine\nDegrees Granted by the University of Wisconsin–Madison Graduate School\nMaster of Accountancy (MAcc)\nMaster of Arts (MA)\nMaster of Business Administration (MBA)\nMaster of Engineering (MEng)\nMaster of Fine Arts (MFA)\nMaster of French Studies (MFS)\nMaster of International Public Affairs (MIPA)\nMaster of Music (MM)\nMaster of Public Affairs (MPA)\nMaster of Science (MS)\nMaster of Social Work (MSW)\nEducational Specialist in School Psychology (EdS)\nDoctor of Audiology (AuD)\nDoctor of Musical Arts (DMA)\nDoctor of Nursing Practice (DNP)\nDoctor of Occupational Therapy (OTD)\nDoctor of Philosophy (PhD)\nFor a list of programs and degrees offered by each department, see UW–Madison Graduate Academic Programs.

See Other Professional Degrees.\nSection Changes\n\nMore\n\n\n\nSection changes include: changes in Lectures, Discussions, Labs and Instructors’ course numbers for research or independent study courses for which students are already enrolled. Always consult the Office of the Registrar for deadlines and procedures for section changes.\nIf a student’s name does not appear on the appropriate instructor’s grade roster at the end of the term, a Course Change Request to change sections and a letter of request from the instructor of the class must be submitted to the Graduate School Office of Academic Services. The instructor of the correct section must submit a Grade Change Form to assign a grade. The instructor of the incorrect section should submit no grade.\nSee Course Changes, Grade Change\nSexual Harassment\n\nMore\n\n\n\nUW–Madison prohibits sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking. These offenses violate UW–Madison policies and are subject to disciplinary action. Sanctions can range from reprimand to expulsion from UW–Madison. In many cases, these offenses also violate Wisconsin criminal law and could lead to arrest and criminal prosecution.\nStudents who experience sexual harassment, sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and/or stalking have many options and services available to them on and off campus, including mental health counseling, victim advocacy and access to the criminal and campus disciplinary systems. For a list a confidential support and reporting options, please visit University Health Services.\nAll students are encouraged to report harassment of any kind, whether it is by a faculty or staff member or another student. Students may contact the Office of Student Assistance and Support: visit 70 Bascom Hall, email OSAS@studentaffairs.wisc.edu, call 608-263-5700 and ask to speak to the Dean on Call, or fill out a Bias Incident Reporting Form.\nFaculty, staff, teaching assistants, and others who work directly with students at UW–Madison are required by law to report first-hand knowledge or disclosures of sexual assault to university officials for statistical purposes. In addition, disclosures made to certain university employees, such as academic advisors or university administrators, may be forwarded to the campus Title IX coordinator for a response. For more information, visit the Office of Student Assistance and Support’s Sexual Assault, Dating and Domestic Violence webpage.\nGraduate students are expected to complete an online violence prevention program. Read more about the violence prevention program for graduate students.\nSee Grievances and Appeals\nSpecial Graduate Committee Degrees\n\nMore\n\n\n\nSpecial graduate committee degrees are one-of-a-kind degrees built around unique needs of individual students that cannot be satisfied by approved programs (e.g., by existing major program/minor combinations, joint degrees, distributed minors, etc.) and may permit individual degrees in new and emerging fields or combinations of disciplines. A higher degree of independence is required on the part of the student, since easily available guidance provided by programs is often more difficult to obtain, and there is not the usual collegial group of students in closely related research and coursework.\nThe master’s and doctoral special graduate committee guidelines are:\n\nProspective students who may have an interest in a special graduate committee degree should apply to the degree program that is closest to their program interest.\nUpon receipt of an application on which a prospective student has expressed interest in a special graduate committee degree, the program will follow all relevant program admission requirements.\nStudents may not be admitted directly to a special graduate committee degree program. They must be accepted for admission by an established department or program and be attending classes at UW–Madison before a proposal for a special graduate committee degree will be considered by the Graduate School.\nThe department or program admitting the student must be prepared to see the student through an established degree program. No commitments are made to provide a special graduate committee degree until after the student is enrolled and the proposal for the special degree and the student’s ability at the graduate level have been evaluated and approved.\nThe student’s advisor authors and submits the special graduate committee degree proposal on behalf of the student as early in the student’s program as possible. Proposals submitted after a substantial portion of the program has been completed will not be accepted. Doctoral proposals must be submitted by the end of the first year of graduate work. Master’s proposals must be submitted after the equivalent of the first full-time semester of graduate work. The proposal should consist of the following elements:\n\nThe reasons the special graduate committee program is needed and an explanation of why the student’s needs cannot be met within existing programs.\nThe exact title of the proposed degree program (which should be brief and descriptive).\nThe proposed course and seminar program of graduate work on this campus. Include the course title, program, course number, credits, grade, and semester taken/to be taken.\nAny specific requirements of the dissertation or thesis (language, equipment, etc.).\nThe nature and scope of preliminary examinations for the doctoral degree, or the examination procedure for the master’s degree.\nThe nature of the dissertation or thesis (general subject area).\nThe names of the faculty members who, in addition to the advisor, are willing to share the responsibility of supervising the student’s program. Including the advisor, the doctoral degree requires 4 members (including 3 UW–Madison graduate faculty members), and the master’s degree requires 3 members (including 2 UW–Madison graduate faculty members). Approval signatures of the committee members are required on the proposal.\n\n\nThe Graduate School will carefully review proposals to determine whether or not the program can be carried out within an established department or program, joint degrees, appropriate use of minors, or other available mechanisms. The suitability and degree of commitment of the committee for the proposed program will be examined.\nThe chairperson of the committee (usually the advisor) should be a member of the program to which the student originally had been admitted. That program should remain the keeper of the student’s records and should make all appropriate nominations for financial aid.\nThe Graduate School is concerned about maintaining active participation by all members of special degree committees in the ongoing program of the student and asks the individual members of the committee to assume program responsibilities provided institutionally in a conventional program. Faculty members who are willing to serve on these committees should be prepared to participate fully in all aspects of the student’s program from the beginning, especially where they must provide the necessary expertise in their particular areas of interest.\n\nSee Committees (Doctoral/Master’s)\nSpecialist Certificates (For students in ELPA or LIS programs)\n\nMore\n\n\n\nStudents can earn a Specialist Certificate in Educational Leadership and Policy Analysis or a Specialist Certificate in Library and Information Studies. The Specialist Certificate represents work beyond the master’s level. In addition to program requirements, the Graduate School requires that the student must meet all Graduate School minimum degree and satisfactory progress requirements as listed in the Graduate School’s Minimum Degree Requirements and Satisfactory Progress chart in the Graduate Guide.\nFor additional information, contact the programs that offer the Specialist Certificates.\nSee Enrollment Requirements, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Transfer Credits for Prior Coursework, Time Limits\nStudy Abroad\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe university creates an international context for education by providing opportunities for UW–Madison students to study overseas. Because of the variety of programs, students should coordinate their study abroad program with their graduate program, the Graduate School, and International Academic Programs (IAP).\nStudents intending to study abroad through a UW–Madison approved study abroad program can learn more about their options through International Academic Programs.\nGraduate students who are interested in conducting research abroad can register for IAP’s UW Graduate Research, which allows students to stay continuously registered as UW–Madison students, receive research credit with their faculty advisor, international health insurance, and 24/7 emergency assistance through IAP. This is an individualized experience and is not tied to a specific study abroad program. Students will need to have a high degree of independence in arranging housing and logistics for themselves.\nAll graduate students traveling abroad are encouraged to acquire insurance through Cultural Insurance Services International.\nSee Fellowships, Insurance and Medical Benefits\nTeaching Assistant (TA)\n\nMore\n\n\n\nMany programs offer Teaching Assistantships. This title is appropriate for graduate students who have been assigned teaching responsibilities in an instructional program under the supervision of a faculty member of the academic staff. Contact the employing program directly for more information about the TA position.\nThe Graduate Assistant Policies and Procedures (GAPP) outline employment-related practices for graduate student teaching assistants.\nSee Enrollment Requirements, Maximum Levels of Appointments, Teaching Assistant (TA) Orientation and Training, Tuition Remission, Payroll Benefits for Graduate Assistants, Fellows, and Trainees\nThesis (Masters)\n\nMore\n\n\n\nSome master’s degrees require a thesis to be deposited in the Memorial Library. The Graduate School produces materials that describe the preparation of a thesis. See the Graduate School’s guide to Completing Your Master’s Degree.\nSee Dissertation and Thesis Standards and Publishing\nTime Limits\n\nMore\n\n\n\nGraduate degrees are awarded, in part, for completion of current coursework. Students who break enrollment from their graduate program may risk losing all credits earned prior to their absence.\nMaster’s degree: students who have been absent for five or more consecutive years lose all credits that they have earned before their absence.\nDoctoral degree: students who have been absent for ten or more consecutive years lose all credits that they have earned before their absence.\nIndividual programs may count the coursework students completed prior to their absence for meeting program requirements; however that coursework will not count toward Graduate School credit requirements. Although the program may count the coursework students did before their absence towards the program requirements, the Graduate School does not count that work toward the Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence, degree, and coursework (50%) credit requirements.\nA candidate for a doctoral degree who fails to take the final oral examination and deposit the dissertation within 5 years after passing the preliminary examination may be required to take another preliminary examination and to be admitted to candidacy a second time.\nA student’s program may appeal these time limits through a written request to the Graduate School Degree Coordinator. The appeal must provide information demonstrating that the student has remained current in the field of study. This information may include a resume showing applicable work experience and/or official transcripts from other schools attended.\nSee Effective Dates, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Preliminary Examinations, Readmission to Graduate School (for previously enrolled graduate students)\nTransfer of Graduate Work from Other Institutions\n\nMore\n\n\n\nUnder the Prior Coursework policy, a student’s program may decide to accept graduate coursework completed outside of the students graduate career at UW–Madison when those courses are rigorous and meet the expectations of a graduate work for the degree. Students should contact their program when inquiring about or attempting to transfer graduate work from other institutions. Coursework earned five or more years prior to admission to a master’s degree or coursework earned ten or more years prior to admission to a doctoral degree is not allowed to satisfy Graduate School minimum credit requirements. See the Satisfying Requirements with Prior Graduate Coursework from Other Institution(s) section of the Prior Coursework policy.\nSee Dean’s Approval, Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Prior Coursework\nTraveling Scholar Program\n\nMore\n\n\n\nThe Big Ten Academic Alliance sponsors the Traveling Scholar Program as part of a continuing effort to increase cooperative use of its member institutions’ resources. This program enables doctoral-level students at any Big Ten Academic Alliance university to take advantage of educational opportunities (specialized courses, unique library collections, unusual laboratories) at any other Big Ten Academic Alliance university without additional tuition expenses. Find a list of member universities.\nCredits earned by Traveling Scholars are transferred by the home university upon receipt of transcript from the host university. Courses and grades are posted directly on a student’s UW–Madison transcript and, if graduate level, count toward the Graduate School’s minimum graduate residence, degree, and coursework credit requirements. Terms are limited to two semesters or three quarters regardless of the number of courses taken.\nStudents interested in the Traveling Scholars Program should contact the Graduate School Degree Coordinator for an application or more information.\nSee Minimum Graduate Coursework (50%) Requirement, Minimum Graduate Degree Credit Requirement, Minimum Graduate Residence Credit Requirement, Transfer Credits for Prior Coursework\nTuition and Fee Information\n\nMore\n\n\n\nStudents go to their MyUW Student Center Tuition Account Summary to view their tuition charges, payments, financial aid, loans, scholarships and refunds; and to access links to set up an “Authorized Payer” and view, print, and pay eBills.\nThe tuition bill is provided as an eBill which is published to view, print, or pay online on the Tuition Account eBill/ePayment secure website. An email is sent to notify students and their Authorized Payers each time a new eBill is published. If students want their parents to have access to the website, students must first set them up as Authorized Payers. Detailed Authorized Payer information is available on the Bursar’s Office How to Add an Authorized Payer webpage.\nTuition and fee charges must be paid by the due date indicated on the tuition and fee statement to avoid a $100 late fee. (Late fee is subject to change.) UW–Madison does not accept debit or credit cards for tuition payment. Detailed payment options and information are available on the Bursar’s Office Payment Methods webpage. For tuition account questions or more information, contact the Bursar’s Office at: tuition@bussvc.wisc.edu (include the student name/ID in the email), or by phone: 608-262-3611.\nThe date a course is dropped or the date a student submits an online withdrawal request determines eligibility for a tuition adjustment. For tuition and fee adjustment and assessment questions, visit the Bursar’s Office Tuition Adjustment webpage or contact them at tuition@bussvc.wisc.edu. Find class drop deadlines, cost adjustments, tuition refund schedules plus other tuition and fees information on the Office of the Registrar’s Dates & Deadlines webpage.\nSee Tuition Remission, Withdrawal\nTuition Remission\n\nMore\n\n\n\nMost graduate students who have a Project Assistantship (PA), a Teaching Assistantship (TA), or a Research Assistantship (RA) of at least a 33% appointment for a fall or spring term are eligible to receive remission of full tuition.\nGraduate students enrolled in service-based pricing programs, such as online and accelerated programs, are ineligible to receive tuition remission. See a list of UW–Madison academic programs with service-based pricing (NetID login required).\nGraduate students should consult with their graduate programs and read their admission and appointment letters carefully to understand their benefits eligibility.\nFellowships that are payrolled through the university and carry stipends equivalent to at least a 33% Research Assistantship also qualify for remission of non-resident tuition.\nStudents should check with the payroll coordinator in their program to determine eligibility.\nAll graduate assistants are responsible for paying their segregated fees.\nTuition is remitted in summer sessions to graduate students in one of the following categories:\n\nThose continuing students who were granted remissions in the immediately-preceding Spring semester provided they held a teaching, research, or project assistantship (all tuition), or graduate fellowship (non-resident portion of tuition) and enroll in the summer session as graduate students;\nThose students who hold research, teaching, or project assistantship appointments, or fellowship appointments for the summer sessions, and who meet the criteria for remission established for the summer session.\n\nFor more information, visit the Bursar’s Office Tuition Remission webpage or view the Bursar’s Tuition Remissions Policy. For questions, contact the Bursar’s Office at remissions@bussvc.wisc.edu.\nSee Enrollment Requirements, Fellowships, Minnesota/Wisconsin Reciprocity, Project or Program Assistant (PA), Research Assistant (RA), Teaching Assistant (TA), Traineeships, Withdrawal, Payroll Benefits for Graduate Assistants, Fellows, and Trainees\nUniversity Special Student Status\n\nMore\n\n\n\nStudents enrolled as University Special students are considered non-degree candidates and pay tuition and fees at the designated special student rate. See the Transfer Credits for Prior Coursework policy for information on how limited credits taken as a University Special Student may be accepted by a graduate program. Students are not allowed to simultaneously enroll as a graduate student and as a University Special student.\nBefore beginning a graduate program, an international student may choose to study full-time English as a University Special student on an F-1 visa granted through the ESL program or on a J-1 visa with the sponsor’s approval. When the student begins a graduate program, the student’s status will be changed from University Special student to graduate student.\nFor more information visit the Adult Career and Special Student Services website or contact them at advising@dcs.wisc.edu.\nVariable Credit Courses\n\nMore\n\n\n\nSome didactic courses are offered to both undergraduate and graduate students. Typically undergraduate students enroll for a higher amount of total credits than do graduate students. Courses of this nature are designated in the Schedule of Classes as variable credit courses. Students should consult the Course Search and Enroll App to determine the appropriate credits when enrolling for a variable credit course.\nViolence Prevention\n\nMore\n\n\n\nUniversity Health Services (UHS) has designed an online sexual violence prevention training program specifically for graduate students to promote the health and safety of the campus community by increasing understanding of sexual assault, harassment, dating and domestic violence, and stalking, as well as prevention strategies, resources, victim rights, and reporting options. Starting fall 2017, all new incoming graduate students, admitted summer 2017 or after, are required to complete the 45-minute online training program within their first semester. Failure to complete the training will result in probation and a registration hold.\nFor further information, review the Task Force on Sexual Violence and Harassment recommendations document, which was adopted by University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents in 2016. For questions, visit the violence prevention program website or email violenceprevention@uhs.wisc.edu.\nWarrants\n\nMore\n\n\n\nA warrant is a program’s recommendation that a student be admitted to doctoral candidacy (a preliminary examination warrant) or be granted a degree (master’s or doctoral degree warrant).  Warrants are requested electronically by the Graduate Program Coordinator.  Once reviewed and approved by the Graduate School Degree Coordinator, the warrant serves as the Graduate School’s notification that a student has met both the Graduate School and program requirements with the exception for  degrees requiring a thesis/dissertation defense or final oral exam/exhibit. Approved warrants for doctoral degrees and master’s degrees requiring a thesis/dissertation defense or final oral exam/exhibit are made available to committee members for signature after evaluating the thesis/dissertation or final oral exam/exhibit.   If the committee decides the student has met this final requirement, the warrant is returned to the Graduate School for final review before the degree is approved (cleared) and awarded (posted).\nSee Certificate of Doctoral Candidacy, Dissertator Status, Dissertation Defense (Final Examination), Preliminary Examinations\nWithdrawal\n\nMore\n\n\n\nWithdrawal indicates that a student intends to stop attending classes for the current semester. Submission of a withdrawal request in MyUW Student Center is required between the first and last day of the semester, when a student wishes to drop all classes in which they are enrolled for the current semester. Requests are then routed electronically to the Graduate School for review. Approval from the Graduate School, as well as from the Office of International Student Services for students on J-1 and F-1 visas, is required before a graduate student is formally withdrawn from the semester. For more information visit the Office of the Registrar’s Withdraw or Cancel Enrollment for a Term webpage.\nIf students drop all courses before the first day of classes, they officially cancel their enrollment, owe no tuition or fees for that term, and have no semester entry on their transcript. In this case, it is not necessary for the student to submit a withdrawal request to the Graduate School. Students planning to withdraw from their academic program should contact their program directly.\nStudents are considered enrolled for a term if they have courses on their record on or after the first day of classes for that term regardless of whether they have paid tuition and fees. Failure to attend classes or leaving the university informally does not excuse a student from having to pay tuition and fees. If students withdraw after the transcript deadline, a notation with the date of withdrawal will appear on the transcript. Enrollment deadlines are posted by the Office of the Registrar on their Enrollment Deadlines webpage.\nFailure to withdraw properly and promptly can be expensive. Before withdrawing, students should consult the Office of the Registrar’s Enrollment Deadlines webpage for specific deadlines and refund dates. If a student received financial aid from the university, they should consult the Office of Student Financial Aid to determine repayment responsibilities. If students withdraw and are receiving remission of tuition, they are responsible for their entire tuition assessment.\nSee Tuition and Fee Information, Tuition Remission\n[CARD]\nStatement on Diversity and Respect\nThe Graduate School Academic Policies and Procedures Glossary on this page serve as the official document of record for Graduate School academic and administrative policies and procedures and are updated continuously. Note some policies redirect to entries in the official UW–Madison Policy Library.\nThe Graduate School Office of Academic Services is the Academic Dean’s Office for all graduate students. Forms requiring the dean’s signature should be submitted to gsacserv@grad.wisc.edu (for example, course change form, audit form, credit overload request form). This office also monitors satisfactory progress toward degree completion.\nIn situations where policies have changed during a student’s time of enrollment, the Graduate School and the academic program, together with the student, may elect to enforce requirements that are in the best interest of the student. Please contact Academic Services with any questions regarding Graduate School procedures and policies. The Academic Policies and Procedures Glossary reflects current policies and procedures of the Graduate School, the Office of the Registrar, the Office of the Bursar, the International Students Services (ISS), and other university units.\nStudents who hold Graduate Assistant positions (TA, PA, and RA) can refer to Graduate Assistant Policies and Procedures (GAPP), available from the Office of Human Resources, for employment-related policies and practices.\n[CARD]\nStatement on Diversity and Respect\nThis is an accordion element with a series of buttons that open and close related content panels.\n\nExpand allCollapse all\n\n\n      Statement on Diversity and Respect    \n\n\nDiversity is a source of strength, creativity, and innovation for UW–Madison. We value the contributions of each person and respect the profound ways their identity, culture, background, experience, status, abilities, and opinion enrich the university community. We commit ourselves to the pursuit of excellence in teaching, research, outreach, and diversity as inextricably linked goals.\nThe University of Wisconsin–Madison fulfills its public mission by creating a welcoming and inclusive community for people from every background—people who as students, faculty, and staff serve Wisconsin and the world.\nInquiries concerning this policy may be directed to the appropriate campus admitting or employing unit, to the Division of Diversity, Equity & Educational Achievement.\n[CARD]\nDiversity is a source of strength, creativity, and innovation for UW–Madison.

Consult the Office of the Registrar’s website for essential enrollment information and important deadlines. Courses may be added, dropped, or swapped through MyUW Student Center before and during the first two weeks of a semester (or the first week in the general 8-week summer session).\nIf a student drops a course, swaps out of a course, decreases credits in a variable credit course (via the “edit” function), or withdraws from the university, tuition and fee refunds are dispensed following a strict refund schedule. Modular courses and summer session courses have a shorter refund period.\nInternational students are not allowed to drop below full-time enrollment unless they have first received authorization from International Student Services (ISS). This will ensure that they remain in compliance with Department of Homeland Security (DHS) visa regulations. International students holding graduate assistantships, fellowships, and traineeships must meet minimum enrollment requirements. A reduced course load from ISS does not exempt graduate students holding assistantships, fellowships, and traineeships from these minimum enrollment requirements.\nIf students enroll for a course and do not attend, they must drop the class or receive a grade of NW (No Work) or, for audited classes, NR (No Report). If students make a course change after the fee refund deadlines (including audited, modular, and zero-credit courses), they may be charged a fee even if the total number of credits for which they are enrolled does not change. The Bursar’s Office will notify students if they owe additional fees or are entitled to a refund.\nStudents should be aware that “swap” is a drop action combined with an add action, allowing them to swap from one section to another section within the same course, or swap one course for another course. Some cautions related to swapping courses:\n\nBecause swap is a DROP and an ADD, the refund and assessment schedules and the dropped (DR) grade notation on the transcript deadline dates apply.\nAll session add/drop deadlines follow the Office of the Registrar’s Enrollment Deadlines.\nClass eligibility controls and prerequisites will be adhered to. If the class is closed or a student is not eligible for that class, the swap will NOT occur.\n\nFor more information and questions, contact the Office of the Registrar or Graduate School Office of Academic Services. Demos & Tutorials for course enrollment are available through the Office of the Registrar. For instructions on how to late add/change/drop a class, visit the Late Enrollment/Late Course Change/Late Drop section.\nSee Authorization for Courses, Course Changes, Credit Changes, Dean’s Approval, Enrollment Requirements, Exceptions, Late Enrollment/Late Course Change/Late Drop, Tuition and Fee Information, Withdrawal\n[CARD]\nAn advisor is a faculty member from the program responsible for providing advice regarding graduate studies and for supervising a student’s degree program (including research). An advisor—sometimes referred to as the major professor, mentor, or trainer—generally serves as chair of a student’s final examination committee.\nThe advisor/student relationship is one of mutual agreement, which may be terminated by either party. If a student changes advisors, they need to notify their program coordinator. It is the responsibility of every graduate student to have an advisor. If students do not have an advisor, the Graduate School may suspend them from further graduate study at UW–Madison until they find an advisor. However, in some cases, particularly for incoming students, the program may assign an advisor.\nWith approval from the program, students can have a co-advisor/co-chair. The co-advisor/co-chair may be from any of the following categories: graduate faculty, faculty from a department without a graduate program, academic staff (including emeritus faculty), visiting faculty, faculty from another institution, scientists, research associates, and other individuals deemed qualified by the program executive committee or its equivalent. Effective September 1, 2017, the co-advisor/co-chair will be designated on dissertation documentation.\nSee Committees (Doctoral/Master’s)",

Courses can be updated three times per year, to coincide with the priority enrollment time period for upcoming terms.\nBelow you will find a short description of items included in course listings and course bubbles. For further information regarding course designations, consult your advisor or view the Requirements for Undergraduate Study. The mortarboard symbol ()  appears before the title of any course that fulfills one of the Communication Part A or Part B, Ethnic Studies, or Quantitative Reasoning Part A or Part B requirements.mortar board\nRequisites represent the academic preparation required to be successful in a course. They are enforced via the enrollment system, meaning a student who attempts to enroll in a course but lacks the requisite preparation will be prevented from enrolling in the course until the requisite has been met.\nIt is assumed that courses in progress at the time of enrollment will be completed successfully and thus fulfill a course requisite. Course administrators/departments may check the completion of these courses and may drop enrolled students who failed or dropped a requisite course and notify them accordingly.\nThere are occasions when a student may have the necessary preparation to be successful in a course, but this preparation is not easily identifiable in their student record. An example would be earned transfer credit that did not equate to a UW-Madison course that meets the spirit of the required course. You may ask the course instructor for permission to enroll in a course for which you do not meet the enforced requisite. Instructor permission will override any restrictions on enrollment the class might have.\nCourses identified in requisites list the subject(s) and catalog number (example: MATH 221). If a course is cross-listed, you will meet the requisite regardless of the subject you enrolled, with one exception (see minimum credits in a subject). For example, ZOOLOGY/​BIOLOGY  101 is the same course, so requisites recognize both Zoology and Biology as fulfilling the requirement; it does not matter which course you enrolled in.\nConcurrent enrollment means being enrolled in a course in the same term as the requisite course. There are three ways these can be written:\nRequisites may specify a certain number of credits in any given subject (example: 3 credits in HISTORY). This means you must have taken at least 3 credits in the HISTORY course array without specifying an individual course. If you take a course cross-listed with HISTORY, but do not enroll in HISTORY, you will not meet the requisite. Example: HISTORY 200\nIn very limited situations, a minimum grade may be included associated with a requisite course (example: a grade of C in Course A). If you are a transfer student, you may need individual permission from the instructor to enroll in courses with this type of requisite. Example: NUTR SCI 431\nThese exam scores are converted into UW-Madison credit via equivalent courses. They do not display publicly in requisites. Due to the nature of the vast array of subject material there isn't always a direct equivalent (exact match from the exam to a UW-Madison course), thus credit will show up on your record as a transfer equivalent (denoted by SUBJECT X##, example GEN ELCT X12). See the list of exams and their equivalent UW-Madison courses in the Placement and Credit by Exam section of Guide.\nThe UW-System and UW-Madison provide placement exams in English, English as a Second Language (ESL), French, German, Math, Spanish and have direct equivalents to UW-Madison courses. Departments may also provide placement exams in other subject matter where a student may have acquired knowledge, skills, or competencies. Requisites use placement exam scores and use the language \"or placement into [course].\" Find more information about these exams and subsequent placement into UW-Madison courses in the Placement and Credit by Exam section of Guide. Example: FRENCH 102\nIf you are transferring to UW-Madison, their previous coursework will be converted to UW-Madison credit/courses. In most cases, you will see the equivalent UW-Madison course on your transcript, which can be used just like the courses above. If there is not a direct equivalent (exact match from your previous institution to a UW-Madison course), you will receive credit in any given subject as a transfer equivalent (denoted by SUBJECT X##, example GEN ELCT X12).\nIn some situations, you may have acquired subject matter knowledge, but did not complete all the learning outcomes associated with UW-Madison general education attributes or designations. Transfer equivalency courses used in this situation provide a transfer credit equivalent to course content without the general education requirement fulfillment. These are included in requisites behind the scenes.\nWhen requisites include a minimum letter grade, the transfer equivalency grade will factor in the requisite as a 2.000 GPA, regardless your grade from the previous institution.\nSome courses utilize the satisfaction of a specific general education requirement as a requisite. These are written as:\nTo see more about general education requirements, see the Requirements for Undergraduate Degrees in Guide.\nSome courses are designed for a specific audience. Requisites limit who can enroll in these courses.\nWhen a course covers a significant portion of another course, a requisite will prevent you from earning credit in courses that are vastly similar. These requisites include statements such as \"Not open to students with credit in [Course A]\", which will prevent you from enrolling in a course where you already have mastered the subject matter. Example: CHEM 327\nCourses may limit enrollment to students only in honors programs. Requisites for these courses will be written as:\nCourses can be designed for specific programs and will have requisites that specify who can enroll. You must be declared in one of these programs to enroll. Requisites will be written as:\nClass standing is based on the number of credits you have earned, credits in progress at time of enrollment, and your academic career (undergraduate, graduate, pharmacy, medical, veterinary, law, or special).\nRequisites using standing can be written in a variety of ways, depending on the audience. If the requisite is Sophomore standing, this includes sophomore, junior, senior, graduate/professional, or special career students. If the requisite is Sophomore standing only, only undergraduate students with 24-53 credits may enroll in the course.\nSome courses may only enroll when you have consent of instructor. These courses usually are independent study, directed study, etc. or courses that require auditions, permission the fist time, or other unique situations that are subjective. This is written as \"Consent of Instructor.\" Example: DANCE 159\nThe following statements were created for inclusion in course syllabi. Instructors are strongly encouraged to reference, or include a link to, these statements in their individual course syllabi. This ensures that consistent institutional information is provided to all students.\nAcademic Calendar & Religious Observances\nEstablishment of the academic calendar for the University of Wisconsin-Madison falls within the authority of the faculty as set forth in Faculty Policies and Procedures. Construction of the academic calendar is subject to various rules and laws prescribed by the Board of Regents, the Faculty Senate, State of Wisconsin and the federal government. For additional dates and deadlines for students, see the Office of the Registrar’s pages. Students are responsible for notifying instructors within the first two weeks of classes about any need for flexibility due to religious observances.\nBy virtue of enrollment, each student agrees to uphold the high academic standards of the University of Wisconsin-Madison; academic misconduct is behavior that negatively impacts the integrity of the institution. Cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration, and helping others commit these previously listed acts are examples of misconduct which may result in disciplinary action. Examples of disciplinary sanctions include, but are not limited to, failure on the assignment/course, written reprimand, disciplinary probation, suspension, or expulsion.\nThe University of Wisconsin-Madison supports the right of all enrolled students to a full and equal educational opportunity. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Wisconsin State Statute (36.12), and UW-Madison policy (UW-855) require the university to provide reasonable accommodations to students with disabilities to access and participate in its academic programs and educational services. Faculty and students share responsibility in the accommodation process. Students are expected to inform faculty of their need for instructional accommodations during the beginning of the semester, or as soon as possible after being approved for accommodations. Faculty will work either directly with the student or in coordination with the McBurney Center to provide reasonable instructional and course-related accommodations. Disability information, including instructional accommodations as part of a student's educational record, is confidential and protected under FERPA. (See: McBurney Disability Resource Center)\nUW-Madison students have the opportunity to evaluate the courses they are enrolled in and their learning experiences through course evaluations. Most instructors use a digital course evaluation tool. In most instances, students receive an official email two weeks prior to the end of the semester, notifying them that anonymous course evaluations are available. Student participation is an integral component of course development, and confidential feedback is important. UW-Madison strongly encourages student participation in course evaluations.\nDiversity is a source of strength, creativity, and innovation for UW-Madison. We value the contributions of each person and respect the profound ways their identity, culture, background, experience, status, abilities, and opinion enrich the university community. We commit ourselves to the pursuit of excellence in teaching, research, outreach, and diversity as inextricably linked goals. The University of Wisconsin-Madison fulfills its public mission by creating a welcoming and inclusive community for people from every background – people who as students, faculty, and staff serve Wisconsin and the world.\nStudents often experience stressors that can impact both their academic experience and personal well-being. These may include mental health concerns, substance misuse, sexual or relationship violence, family circumstances, campus climate, financial matters, among others.\nStudents are encouraged to learn about and utilize UW-Madison's mental health services and/or other resources as needed.

Students in courses may use the materials and recordings for their personal use related to participation in class. Students may also take notes solely for their personal use. If a lecture is not already recorded, students are not authorized to record lectures without permission unless they are considered by the university to be a qualified student with a disability who has an approved accommodation that includes recording. [Regent Policy Document 4-1] Students may not copy or have lecture materials and recordings outside of class, including posting on internet sites or selling to commercial entities, with the exception of sharing copies of personal notes as a notetaker through the McBurney Disability Resource Center. Students are otherwise prohibited from providing or selling their personal notes to anyone else or being paid for taking notes by any person or commercial firm without the instructor’s express written permission. Unauthorized use of these copyrighted lecture materials and recordings constitutes copyright infringement and may be addressed under the university’s policies, UWS Chapters 14 and 17, governing student academic and non-academic misconduct.\nRights & Responsibilities\nThe privacy and security of faculty, staff and students’ personal information is a top priority for UW-Madison. The university carefully reviews and vets all campus-supported digital tools used for teaching and learning, including those that support data empowered educational practices and proctoring. View the university’s full teaching and learning data transparency statement.\n• Skip to Content\n• AZ Index\n• Catalog Home\n• Accounting and Information Systems (ACCT I S)\n• Actuarial Science (ACT SCI)\n• African American Studies (AFROAMER)\n• African Cultural Studies (AFRICAN)\n• Agricultural and Applied Economics (A A E)\n• Agroecology (AGROECOL)\n• Air Force Aerospace Studies (A F AERO)\n• American Indian Studies (AMER IND)\n• Anatomy (ANATOMY)\n• Anatomy & Physiology (ANAT&PHY)\n• Anesthesiology (ANESTHES)\n• Animal Sciences (AN SCI)\n• Anthropology (ANTHRO)\n• Applied Biotechnology (ABT)\n• Art Department (ART)\n• Art Education (Department of Art) (ART ED)\n• Art History (ART HIST)\n• Asian American Studies (ASIAN AM)\n• Asian Languages and Cultures (ASIAN)\n• Asian Languages and Cultures: Languages (ASIALANG)\n• Astronomy (ASTRON)\n• Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences (ATM OCN)\n• Biochemistry (BIOCHEM)\n• Biological Systems Engineering (BSE)\n• Biology (BIOLOGY)\n• Biology Core Curriculum (BIOCORE)\n• Biomedical Engineering (B M E)\n• Biomedical Sciences and Technologies (BIOMDSCI)\n• Biomolecular Chemistry (BMOLCHEM)\n• Biostatistics and Medical Informatics (B M I)\n• Botany (BOTANY)\n• Cell and Regenerative Biology (CRB)\n• Chemical and Biological Engineering (CBE)\n• Chemistry (CHEM)\n• Chicana/o and Latina/o Studies (CHICLA)\n• Civil and Environmental Engineering (CIV ENGR)\n• Civil Society and Community Studies (CSCS)\n• Classics (CLASSICS)\n• Collaborative Nursing Program (CNP)\n• Communication Arts (COM ARTS)\n• Communication Sciences and Disorders (CS&D)\n• Community and Environmental Sociology (C&E SOC)\n• Comparative Biosciences (COMP BIO)\n• Comparative Literature (COMP LIT)\n• Computer Sciences (COMP SCI)\n• Consumer Science (CNSR SCI)\n• Counseling Psychology (COUN PSY)\n• Curriculum and Instruction (CURRIC)\n• Dairy Science (DY SCI)\n• Dance (DANCE)\n• Dermatology (DERM)\n• Design Studies (DS)\n• Economics (ECON)\n• Educational Leadership and Policy Analysis (ELPA)\n• Educational Policy Studies (ED POL)\n• Educational Psychology (ED PSYCH)\n• Electrical and Computer Engineering (E C E)\n• Emergency Medicine (EMER MED)\n• Engineering Mechanics and Aerospace Engineering (E M A)\n• Engineering Physics (E P)\n• Engineering Professional Development (E P D)\n• English as a Second Language (ESL)\n• English (ENGL)\n• Entomology (ENTOM)\n• Environmental Studies -

Start out by learning the admissions process and deadlines, faculty research interests, required and recommended curriculum, the funding landscape, and what the experience of other students in the program has been like. In particular, exploring faculty research interests is key to deciding for yourself if UW–Madison is the right university for you, and it is important as you articulate to the program’s admissions committee why you are a good fit.\nEach graduate program has its own deadlines, admission committee, and recommendation process; direct any questions to the contact person listed on the program-specific information page.\nAlthough the Graduate School sets minimum requirements, other application requirements vary by program. Check out the links below to find out more about what you will need to apply.\nYou can apply for up to 3 programs within the same entry term. The application fee is $75, plus an additional $6 processing fee for international applicants. Your materials will first be reviewed by your program, then by the Graduate School.\nTo review the status of your submitted application, log in to your Application Portal. Any requests for information or changes in your status will be noted in the portal.\nRecommendations are made by programs, and the Graduate School makes final admission decisions. Decisions can be viewed in the Application Portal, where applicants accept or decline admission.\nOnce you are admitted, you commit to begin your graduate program in the term for which you applied. UW–Madison considers requests to change your start term on a case by case basis.\nTerm changes are considered for extraordinary circumstances outside a student’s control. Examples include:\nTerm change requests are not granted for voluntary or preference based reasons, such as taking a gap year or starting a full time job.\nYou must request a term change before the term for which you were originally admitted begins. Term changes can be requested for adjacent semesters only.* Contact your graduate program for more information.\nFor summer 2025 and fall 2025 entry terms only, the Graduate School will consider term changes of up to one year from a student’s original admit term.\nFor help with your application, first look through these frequently asked questions. If you have other questions or encounter any problems with your application, contact admissions at admissions@grad.wisc.edu.\nThis is an accordion element with a series of buttons that open and close related content panels.\nThe application fee is $75 U.S. It is non-refundable and can be paid by credit card (MasterCard or Visa), Debit/ATM. In addition, non-U.S. citizens will be charged a $6 international document processing fee.\nApplication deadlines vary from program to program. Before starting your application, it is very important to check the deadlines on your academic program’s page.\nThe application fee is non-refundable. Before submitting an application, we encourage all applicants to make sure you have:\nSubmitted application materials cannot be updated or changed. If you wish to add application materials after submission, you must contact your program to see if their review timeline and policies allow applicants to provide new documentation. Any new documentation accepted by the program will be added to your application, and will not replace existing documentation. You can find contact information for your program on your academic program’s Graduate Guide page.\nYou can update your recommendations after submission by following the directions below:\nOnce you have submitted your application, you cannot change your term. You will need to submit a new application for the same program for the correct term which will require creating a new application and paying an additional application fee.\nYou can apply for up to 3 programs within the same entry term (spring term, summer term, or fall term) for one application fee. You will pay the application fee for the first submitted application. The fee will automatically be waived for the next two applications submitted for the same entry term.\nPlease note that submitted recommendations do not carry over from one application to the next. If applying to multiple programs that require recommendations, your recommender(s) will need to upload a new recommendation for each application you submit.\nWhen you apply, you will be asked to upload copies of your transcripts. The copies of your transcripts uploaded into the application are used for review purposes only and are considered unofficial transcripts.\nIf you are recommended for admission by your program, the Graduate School will email you directions on how to provide official transcripts to the Graduate School Office of Admissions for final review and processing.\nAll transcripts become property of the UW–Madison Graduate School and will not be returned to you.\nAfter you have applied, you can check which official transcripts have been received by the UW-Madison Graduate School Office of Admissions by following the directions below:\nPlease note that University of Wisconsin-Madison students applying to the Graduate School do not need to send an official University of Wisconsin-Madison transcript. We will access those transcripts internally.\nIf you are recommended for admission by your program, the Graduate School will send you an email requesting official transcripts. You will need to have your most current official transcript sent from your undergraduate institution to the Graduate School so our office can review your credentials and admit you. Once you have earned your undergraduate degree, you will need to have a final transcript (and degree certificate if needed) sent to the Graduate School, or else an enrollment hold will be put on your account for your second term.\nMany institutions introduced new grading schemes such as satisfactory/unsatisfactory, pass/fail, or credit/noncredit during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Some institutions enforced the new grading schemes while others let students choose between the new grading scheme or traditional letter grades. In either case, we trust that both institutions and their students made efforts to maintain the highest level of rigor and integrity in educational outcomes.\nConsequently, our admissions committees and our program faculty will be empathetic to COVID-19 challenges and allow flexibility in the evaluation of applicants, especially in the use of 2020 grades.\nThe Graduate School offers a limited number of application fee grants to make sure that the application fee is not a barrier for students from our key recruiting initiatives. Please visit the Graduate School’s Application Fee Grant webpage for additional information and directions for requesting a fee grant.\nPlease note: the Wisconsin School of Business has its own criteria for granting fee waivers. For more information on those waivers, contact the admissions team for the program to which you are applying.

Some institutions enforced the new grading schemes while others let students choose between the new grading scheme or traditional letter grades. In either case, we trust that both institutions and their students made efforts to maintain the highest level of rigor and integrity in educational outcomes.\nConsequently, our admissions committees and our program faculty will be empathetic to COVID-19 challenges and allow flexibility in the evaluation of applicants, especially in the use of 2020 grades.\n[CARD]\nAm I eligible for a fee waiver?\nThe Graduate School offers a limited number of application fee grants to make sure that the application fee is not a barrier for students from our key recruiting initiatives.

School Policies\n[HEADING] Academic Calendar\n[HEADING] Contact Information\nThe Graduate Guide provides an overview of UW–Madison programs that offer graduate degrees, doctoral minors, graduate/professional certificates, and capstone certificates. The Graduate Guide is the key source for program-specific policies regarding admission, degree requirements, funding, prior coursework, and more.\nThe information in this Guide is current for the academic year, including the summer, fall, and spring terms. The Guide is an official document of record and is reviewed and updated every year.\nThe Guide is published only online; printed copies are not available. Archived editions from past years are available in the Archive.\nStudents are responsible for meeting the academic requirements that were in effect at the time they matriculated, including satisfactory progress and degree requirements. In situations when academic requirements change during a student’s time of enrollment, the Graduate School and the academic program, together with the student, may elect to enforce requirements that are in the best interest of the student.\nThe UW–Madison Graduate School confers:\nThe Graduate School oversees the administration of those degrees, doctoral minors, graduate/professional certificates, and capstone certificates. Some major programs have identified sub-majors, known as “named options”. Official named options are approved by university governance and appear on the transcript when the degree is conferred. Some programs also have unofficial pathways that do not appear on the transcript.\nDegree programs must be rationally unified, with courses that contribute to an organized program of study and/or research. Courses must be selected from groups embracing one principal subject of concentration called the major (see Degrees).\nThe major field is normally coextensive with the work of a single department or with one of the subjects under which certain programs have been formally arranged.  The Graduate School requires all doctoral programs to incorporate a breadth requirement. The breadth requirement is designed to represent a coherent body of work, taken as a graduate student, and should not be simply an after-the-fact ratification of a number of courses taken outside the major department.\nGraduate School minimum credits and other requirements necessary to earn degrees are listed in the Graduate School Minimum Degree Requirements and Policies sections; each program may set degree requirements and expectations more stringent than Graduate School policy.\nThe Graduate School offers links to information about admissions, program data profiles, funding resources, diversity, professional development, graduate student life, and other resources.\nThe Graduate School's Academic Policies and Procedures Glossary provides information about Graduate School academic and administrative policies, procedures and definitions of commonly used terms in graduate education. Note some policies redirect to entries in the official UW–Madison Policy Library. This glossary reflects current policies and procedures of the Graduate School, the Office of the Registrar, the Office of the Bursar, the International Students Services (ISS), and other university units.\nGraduate Assistant Policies and Procedures (GAPP) outlines employment-related practices for graduate student teaching, research, and project assistantships.\nThe Graduate School Office of Professional Development and Communications (OPDC) coordinates, develops, and promotes learning opportunities to foster the academic, professional, and life skills of graduate students.\nProfessional development topics include Individual Development Plans, communication, mentoring, grant writing, dissertation writing, career exploration, job search strategies, and more. The office provides a wealth of resources and events tailored to the needs of UW–Madison graduate students.\nThe Office of Professional Development and Communications developed and maintains DiscoverPD, an innovative tool for UW–Madison graduate students to advance their academic and professional goals. DiscoverPD introduces eight areas (or \"facets\") of professional development, includes a self-assessment, and provides a customized report of areas of strength and weakness. The report comes with recommendations to help graduate students strengthen their ability within each area.\nMore information on campus resources for student professional development is available at Professional Development. Students may keep up-to-date by reading GradConnections, the newsletter for graduate students, bookmarking the Events Calendar to keep tabs on upcoming workshops of interest, and following the Graduate School’s X, Facebook, YouTube, or Instagram accounts.\nThe University of Wisconsin-Madison is committed to providing equal opportunity and equal access in compliance with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations and Universities of Wisconsin and university non-discrimination policies and procedures.\nThe Office of Compliance promotes ethical conduct and compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and UW-Madison policies. UW-Madison’s non-discrimination statement, contact information for the university’s Equal Opportunity Investigations Administrator, Title IX Coordinator, ADA Coordinator as well as information regarding UW-Madison’s Equal Opportunity Complaint process is available on the Office of Compliance’s website.\nThe McBurney Disability Resource Center is an office within the Division of Student Affairs that views disability as an important aspect of the diversity of UW-Madison. The Center is committed to creating an accessible and inclusive educational experience for students, by partnering with students, faculty, and staff to design accessible environments and to provide academic accommodations so that students can engage, explore and participate in the Wisconsin Idea.\nThe Center works with UW-Madison students with physical, learning, hearing, vision, psychological, health and other disabilities substantially affecting a major life activity (e.g., walking, communicating, learning, seeing, breathing, reading, etc.). Many students have non-apparent disabilities such as depression, anxiety, autism spectrum, learning disabilities, AD/HD and health conditions such as Crohn’s disease or fibromyalgia.\nCommon accommodations include extended time and/or small group environment for exams, note taking support, sign language interpreting, real time and media captioning, and conversion of printed materials to accessible formats. McBurney Center staff members also collaborate with students and faculty to determine reasonable flexibility with regard to attendance, participation, and deadlines for conditions that fluctuate in severity over the course of enrollment. The Center makes referrals to other campus offices or community resources for non-classroom accommodations related to housing, transportation, personal care needs, and so on. Students should contact the Center upon admission to begin the eligibility for services process. Early notice is essential in order to have accommodations in place prior to the start of the semester. For detailed information, see apply for accommodations.\nMcBurney Disability Resource Center 702 West Johnson Street, Suite 2104 Madison, WI 53706 608-263-2741 (voice) 608-225-7956 (text) 608-265-2998 (fax) mcburney@studentlife.wisc.edu www.mcburney.wisc.edu\nThe University of Wisconsin–Madison is accredited by the:\nHigher Learning Commission\n230 South Lasalle Street, Suite 7-500\nChicago, IL 60604\ntelephone 1-800-621-7440\nwww.hlcommission.org\nUW–Madison, which was first accredited in 1913, was last accredited in 2019, and will go through a reaccreditation process again in 2028–29.\nSee Mark of Affiliation.\nRegistration with the Minnesota Office of Higher Education: The University of Wisconsin–Madison is a public institution registered as a \"Private Institution\" with the Minnesota Office of Higher Education pursuant to sections 136A.61 to 136A.71. Registration is not an endorsement of the institution. Credits earned at the institution may not transfer to all other institutions.\nThe information, policies, and rules contained herein are subject to change.\nFilter Graduate Degrees\nExplore Graduate School Program Data\nView as list View as grid\nThe university offers several degree and capstone certificate programs that are fully or partially available at a distance or that are flexible to working schedules with evening and/or weekend courses. To learn more about the graduate-level degrees and certificates offered in flexible and online formats, visit the Wisconsin Professional Degrees & Certificates portal.\nBreadth is a required component of doctoral training at UW–Madison. A student’s doctoral major program determines how breadth is achieved: students either complete an additional program of a doctoral minor or graduate/professional certificate, or breadth is built into the doctoral major program curriculum. Most major programs advise students to enroll in a doctoral minor or graduate/professional certificate to meet the breadth requirement. If a doctoral minor or graduate/professional/capstone certificate is not required by the student’s doctoral major program, it is noted on the Requirements tab of the Guide degree or named option page. See the Graduate School: Breadth Requirement in Doctoral Training policy for minimum course requirements for the minor.\nView as list View as grid\nGraduate/professional certificates are available to all degree-seeking graduate and professional students (Graduate, Law, Medicine, Pharmacy, Veterinary Medicine careers) and meet the Graduate School’s breadth requirement. Graduate/professional certificate programs coordinate teaching and research among scholars active in interrelated disciplines.\nView as list View as grid\nCapstone certificates allow individuals with a bachelor’s degree to obtain additional professional skills. Capstones do not lead to the conferral of a degree but do appear on a student’s UW–Madison transcript.\nGraduate students are not eligible to enroll in capstone certificates.\nCapstone certificate students are admitted as University Special students through Adult Career and Special Student Services (ACSSS). ACSSS is the academic dean and is responsible for issues related to student enrollment and the student's official record.\nAn Adult Career and Special Student Services student services coordinator works with each department's capstone certificate coordinator on advising, admissions, enrollment eligibility, and program completion. Capstone certificates typically follow the rules of the Graduate School for tuition, credit limits, and grading.\nThe availability of a capstone certificate program to an international student varies as follows:\nView as list View as grid\nThe University of Wisconsin–Madison has offered graduate study for more than a century. The faculty of more than 2,000 distinguished scholars and teachers, supported by an academic staff exceeding 10,000 confers graduate degrees in more than 160 fields of study.\nAs one of the nation's major research institutions, the university maintains extensive research facilities.\nKeep in mind:\nAdmitted graduate students may request a change to their initial term of enrollment, provided the request is supported by a valid reason as outlined here and receives approval from both the admitting program and the Graduate School. International students must comply with full-time enrollment requirements applicable to their new term of entry.\nAcceptance of an offer of financial support* (such as a graduate scholarship, fellowship, traineeship, or assistantship) for the next academic year by a prospective or enrolled graduate student completes an agreement that both student and graduate school expect to honor. In that context, the conditions affecting such offers and their acceptance must be defined carefully and understood by all parties.\nStudents are under no obligation to respond to offers of financial support prior to April 15. Earlier deadlines for acceptance of such offers violate the intent of this Resolution. If an applicant accepts an offer before April 15 and then decides to withdraw that acceptance, they may submit in writing a resignation of the appointment at any time through April 15. Applicants must inform the program that they are withdrawing their acceptance of the offer, they then can accept any other offers.\nIt is further agreed by the institutions and organizations subscribing to the above Resolution that a copy of this Resolution or a link to the URL should accompany every scholarship, fellowship, traineeship, and assistantship offer.\n*Note that this Resolution applies to offers of financial support only, not offers of admission.\nStudents are responsible for reviewing Guide and obtaining specific program requirements from the program. Many programs publish a graduate student handbook, which provides more details about graduate study and other policies and processes.\nThe table below includes Graduate School minimum degree requirements and other information that is featured on each program page. Schools/colleges, departments and programs may set more stringent requirements than the Graduate School.\nMA, MS, MAcc, MBA, MM, MEng, MIPA, MPA, MSW\nAuD, DMA, DNP, OTD, PhD\nAll doctoral students are required to complete a doctoral minor or graduate/professional certificate. Refer to the Graduate School: Breadth Requirement in Doctoral Training policy.\nFor more information, please consult the Graduate School Academic Policies and Procedures.\nAll institutional policies can be found in the policy library. The table below highlights select Graduate School academic policies. Programs may set more stringent policies than the Graduate School. Refer to specific program pages for more information.\nEstablishment of the academic calendar for the University of Wisconsin–Madison falls within the authority of the faculty as set forth in Faculty Policies and Procedures. Construction of the academic calendar is subject to various rules and guidelines prescribed by the Board of Regents, the Faculty Senate and State of Wisconsin legislation. The Faculty Senate approves an academic calendar which spans a future five-year period.\nGraduate Schoolgrad.wisc.edu\n• Skip to Content\n• AZ Index\n• Catalog Home\n• Editions and Archives\n•

School Policies\n[HEADING] Academic Calendar\n[HEADING] Contact Information\nThe Graduate Guide provides an overview of UW–Madison programs that offer graduate degrees, doctoral minors, graduate/professional certificates, and capstone certificates. The Graduate Guide is the key source for program-specific policies regarding admission, degree requirements, funding, prior coursework, and more.\nThe information in this Guide is current for the academic year, including the summer, fall, and spring terms. The Guide is an official document of record and is reviewed and updated every year.\nThe Guide is published only online; printed copies are not available. Archived editions from past years are available in the Archive.\nStudents are responsible for meeting the academic requirements that were in effect at the time they matriculated, including satisfactory progress and degree requirements. In situations when academic requirements change during a student’s time of enrollment, the Graduate School and the academic program, together with the student, may elect to enforce requirements that are in the best interest of the student.\nThe UW–Madison Graduate School confers:\nThe Graduate School oversees the administration of those degrees, doctoral minors, graduate/professional certificates, and capstone certificates. Some major programs have identified sub-majors, known as “named options”. Official named options are approved by university governance and appear on the transcript when the degree is conferred. Some programs also have unofficial pathways that do not appear on the transcript.\nDegree programs must be rationally unified, with courses that contribute to an organized program of study and/or research. Courses must be selected from groups embracing one principal subject of concentration called the major (see Degrees).\nThe major field is normally coextensive with the work of a single department or with one of the subjects under which certain programs have been formally arranged.  The Graduate School requires all doctoral programs to incorporate a breadth requirement. The breadth requirement is designed to represent a coherent body of work, taken as a graduate student, and should not be simply an after-the-fact ratification of a number of courses taken outside the major department.\nGraduate School minimum credits and other requirements necessary to earn degrees are listed in the Graduate School Minimum Degree Requirements and Policies sections; each program may set degree requirements and expectations more stringent than Graduate School policy.\nThe Graduate School offers links to information about admissions, program data profiles, funding resources, diversity, professional development, graduate student life, and other resources.\nThe Graduate School's Academic Policies and Procedures Glossary provides information about Graduate School academic and administrative policies, procedures and definitions of commonly used terms in graduate education. Note some policies redirect to entries in the official UW–Madison Policy Library. This glossary reflects current policies and procedures of the Graduate School, the Office of the Registrar, the Office of the Bursar, the International Students Services (ISS), and other university units.\nGraduate Assistant Policies and Procedures (GAPP) outlines employment-related practices for graduate student teaching, research, and project assistantships.\nThe Graduate School Office of Professional Development and Communications (OPDC) coordinates, develops, and promotes learning opportunities to foster the academic, professional, and life skills of graduate students.\nProfessional development topics include Individual Development Plans, communication, mentoring, grant writing, dissertation writing, career exploration, job search strategies, and more. The office provides a wealth of resources and events tailored to the needs of UW–Madison graduate students.\nThe Office of Professional Development and Communications developed and maintains DiscoverPD, an innovative tool for UW–Madison graduate students to advance their academic and professional goals. DiscoverPD introduces eight areas (or \"facets\") of professional development, includes a self-assessment, and provides a customized report of areas of strength and weakness. The report comes with recommendations to help graduate students strengthen their ability within each area.\nMore information on campus resources for student professional development is available at Professional Development. Students may keep up-to-date by reading GradConnections, the newsletter for graduate students, bookmarking the Events Calendar to keep tabs on upcoming workshops of interest, and following the Graduate School’s X, Facebook, YouTube, or Instagram accounts.\nThe University of Wisconsin-Madison is committed to providing equal opportunity and equal access in compliance with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations and Universities of Wisconsin and university non-discrimination policies and procedures.\nThe Office of Compliance promotes ethical conduct and compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and UW-Madison policies. UW-Madison’s non-discrimination statement, contact information for the university’s Equal Opportunity Investigations Administrator, Title IX Coordinator, ADA Coordinator as well as information regarding UW-Madison’s Equal Opportunity Complaint process is available on the Office of Compliance’s website.\nThe McBurney Disability Resource Center is an office within the Division of Student Affairs that views disability as an important aspect of the diversity of UW-Madison. The Center is committed to creating an accessible and inclusive educational experience for students, by partnering with students, faculty, and staff to design accessible environments and to provide academic accommodations so that students can engage, explore and participate in the Wisconsin Idea.\nThe Center works with UW-Madison students with physical, learning, hearing, vision, psychological, health and other disabilities substantially affecting a major life activity (e.g., walking, communicating, learning, seeing, breathing, reading, etc.). Many students have non-apparent disabilities such as depression, anxiety, autism spectrum, learning disabilities, AD/HD and health conditions such as Crohn’s disease or fibromyalgia.\nCommon accommodations include extended time and/or small group environment for exams, note taking support, sign language interpreting, real time and media captioning, and conversion of printed materials to accessible formats. McBurney Center staff members also collaborate with students and faculty to determine reasonable flexibility with regard to attendance, participation, and deadlines for conditions that fluctuate in severity over the course of enrollment. The Center makes referrals to other campus offices or community resources for non-classroom accommodations related to housing, transportation, personal care needs, and so on. Students should contact the Center upon admission to begin the eligibility for services process. Early notice is essential in order to have accommodations in place prior to the start of the semester. For detailed information, see apply for accommodations.\nMcBurney Disability Resource Center 702 West Johnson Street, Suite 2104 Madison, WI 53706 608-263-2741 (voice) 608-225-7956 (text) 608-265-2998 (fax) mcburney@studentlife.wisc.edu www.mcburney.wisc.edu\nThe University of Wisconsin–Madison is accredited by the:\nHigher Learning Commission\n230 South Lasalle Street, Suite 7-500\nChicago, IL 60604\ntelephone 1-800-621-7440\nwww.hlcommission.org\nUW–Madison, which was first accredited in 1913, was last accredited in 2019, and will go through a reaccreditation process again in 2028–29.\nSee Mark of Affiliation.\nRegistration with the Minnesota Office of Higher Education: The University of Wisconsin–Madison is a public institution registered as a \"Private Institution\" with the Minnesota Office of Higher Education pursuant to sections 136A.61 to 136A.71.

To learn more about the graduate-level degrees and certificates offered in flexible and online formats, visit the Wisconsin Professional Degrees & Certificates portal.\nBreadth is a required component of doctoral training at UW–Madison. A student’s doctoral major program determines how breadth is achieved: students either complete an additional program of a doctoral minor or graduate/professional certificate, or breadth is built into the doctoral major program curriculum. Most major programs advise students to enroll in a doctoral minor or graduate/professional certificate to meet the breadth requirement. If a doctoral minor or graduate/professional/capstone certificate is not required by the student’s doctoral major program, it is noted on the Requirements tab of the Guide degree or named option page. See the Graduate School: Breadth Requirement in Doctoral Training policy for minimum course requirements for the minor.\nView as list View as grid\nGraduate/professional certificates are available to all degree-seeking graduate and professional students (Graduate, Law, Medicine, Pharmacy, Veterinary Medicine careers) and meet the Graduate School’s breadth requirement. Graduate/professional certificate programs coordinate teaching and research among scholars active in interrelated disciplines.\nView as list View as grid\nCapstone certificates allow individuals with a bachelor’s degree to obtain additional professional skills. Capstones do not lead to the conferral of a degree but do appear on a student’s UW–Madison transcript.\nGraduate students are not eligible to enroll in capstone certificates.\nCapstone certificate students are admitted as University Special students through Adult Career and Special Student Services (ACSSS). ACSSS is the academic dean and is responsible for issues related to student enrollment and the student's official record.\nAn Adult Career and Special Student Services student services coordinator works with each department's capstone certificate coordinator on advising, admissions, enrollment eligibility, and program completion. Capstone certificates typically follow the rules of the Graduate School for tuition, credit limits, and grading.\nThe availability of a capstone certificate program to an international student varies as follows:\nView as list View as grid\nThe University of Wisconsin–Madison has offered graduate study for more than a century. The faculty of more than 2,000 distinguished scholars and teachers, supported by an academic staff exceeding 10,000 confers graduate degrees in more than 160 fields of study.\nAs one of the nation's major research institutions, the university maintains extensive research facilities.\nKeep in mind:\nAdmitted graduate students may request a change to their initial term of enrollment, provided the request is supported by a valid reason as outlined here and receives approval from both the admitting program and the Graduate School. International students must comply with full-time enrollment requirements applicable to their new term of entry.\nAcceptance of an offer of financial support* (such as a graduate scholarship, fellowship, traineeship, or assistantship) for the next academic year by a prospective or enrolled graduate student completes an agreement that both student and graduate school expect to honor. In that context, the conditions affecting such offers and their acceptance must be defined carefully and understood by all parties.\nStudents are under no obligation to respond to offers of financial support prior to April 15. Earlier deadlines for acceptance of such offers violate the intent of this Resolution. If an applicant accepts an offer before April 15 and then decides to withdraw that acceptance, they may submit in writing a resignation of the appointment at any time through April 15. Applicants must inform the program that they are withdrawing their acceptance of the offer, they then can accept any other offers.\nIt is further agreed by the institutions and organizations subscribing to the above Resolution that a copy of this Resolution or a link to the URL should accompany every scholarship, fellowship, traineeship, and assistantship offer.\n*Note that this Resolution applies to offers of financial support only, not offers of admission.\nStudents are responsible for reviewing Guide and obtaining specific program requirements from the program. Many programs publish a graduate student handbook, which provides more details about graduate study and other policies and processes.\nThe table below includes Graduate School minimum degree requirements and other information that is featured on each program page. Schools/colleges, departments and programs may set more stringent requirements than the Graduate School.\nMA, MS, MAcc, MBA, MM, MEng, MIPA, MPA, MSW\nAuD, DMA, DNP, OTD, PhD\nAll doctoral students are required to complete a doctoral minor or graduate/professional certificate. Refer to the Graduate School: Breadth Requirement in Doctoral Training policy.\nFor more information, please consult the Graduate School Academic Policies and Procedures.\nAll institutional policies can be found in the policy library. The table below highlights select Graduate School academic policies. Programs may set more stringent policies than the Graduate School. Refer to specific program pages for more information.\nEstablishment of the academic calendar for the University of Wisconsin–Madison falls within the authority of the faculty as set forth in Faculty Policies and Procedures. Construction of the academic calendar is subject to various rules and guidelines prescribed by the Board of Regents, the Faculty Senate and State of Wisconsin legislation. The Faculty Senate approves an academic calendar which spans a future five-year period.\nGraduate Schoolgrad.wisc.edu\n• Skip to Content\n• AZ Index\n• Catalog Home\n• Editions and Archives\n•
