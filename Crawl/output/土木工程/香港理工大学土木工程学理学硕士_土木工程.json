      "content": "[HEADING] Quick Access\nSept 2026 Entry\n1 year (Full-time)2.5 years (Part-time)\nProgramme Aims\nThis programme aims to benefit professionals who already have a bachelor's in construction or related disciplines and who work in or around Hong Kong. Primarily, the programme offers opportunities for practising architects, construction managers, engineers, surveyors, technologists and related professionals to broaden and deepen their knowledge of project management.\nMany businesses need professionals who are skilled in project management and are also capable of innovating solutions to complex problems. Thus, this programme helps students to develop an innovative approach to problem solving in general and to project management in particular. This produces highly skilled management professionals to operate in Hong Kong and the surrounding region. Moreover, the dissertation allows MSc students to deeply examine a topic of their own choice.\nCharacteristics\nThe programme has a student-centred learning philosophy, i.e., it teaches students how to learn, thereby making good use of the pool of knowledge and experience within each subject. As the staff of the programme are leading researchers in their fields or professionals who share their knowledge of the industry, they use their own experience to encourage students to learn systematically. This introduces students to the theories and good practices of managing projects from both technological and business perspectives.\nThe MSc programme has been accredited by the Chartered Institute of Building, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and the Hong Kong Institute of Project Management, as it fulfils these organisations’ academic requirements for professional assessment that can lead to corporate membership. These accreditations are subject to regular reviews by the respective professional institutions.\nProgramme Structure\nStudents may pursue their studies either on a full-time or part-time basis. Students must complete EITHER 10 subjects (including 5 Compulsory Core Subjects and at least 2 other Core Subjects) OR 7 subjects (including 5 Compulsory Core Subjects) and a Dissertation (9 credits). Each Compulsory Core and Core Subject consists of three full-day weekend (Saturdays and/or Sundays) workshops. Study materials for these workshops will be provided to students during each semester to progress learning between workshops. Daytime classes on weekdays may be offered to full-time students in some subjects.\nStudents may choose up to 3 Elective Subjects (3 credits each) from the pool of subjects that is offered by the Department of Building and Real Estate or its sister departments within the Faculty of Construction of Environment. Some subjects may be offered on weekday evenings on a 13-week basis.\nApplicants whose educational background is not in a construction-related area are recommended to take CSE565 Construction Technology, or BRE550 Statutory Framework for Construction Practice or its equivalent (as designated by the Programme Leader) as an elective subject.\nStudents also must complete a 1-credit bearing subject on Academic Integrity and Ethics (no credit fee will be charged) and a non-credit bearing e-learning module on National Education, which are University's requirements.\nFull-time students are recommended to complete 7 subjects and a Dissertation within the normal duration of one academic year.\nPart-time students’ first year emphasises project management processes and techniques, thereby providing them with contemporary and in-depth knowledge of project management. This is supplemented by insights into the major factors that affect real estate development. In their second year, students learn about elements such as value management, and finance and international construction, which gives them specialised knowledge of construction project management at the macro level. After completing 7 subjects, students may integrate critical analysis, evaluation and application of the knowledge gained from the programme with their own experience to produce a research-based dissertation. Alternatively, instead of a dissertation, they may complete 3 additional subjects.\nCore Areas of Study\nThe following is a list of Core Subjects in the programme.\n* Compulsory Core Subject\n@ Students opting for dissertation (normal period is 3 semesters including a summer term) are required to take BRE587 either in parallel or in advance.

During coursework, my professors systematically built comprehensive knowledge frameworks to provide a solid academic foundation. Faculty members demonstrated not only profound erudition but also exceptional pedagogical acumen in scaffolding critical thinking through dynamic case studies. The methodically designed curriculum, coupled with expeditious feedback mechanisms on academic assignments, synergistically enhanced my competencies. Collaborative projects served as strategic incubators that fostered sophisticated synergistic teamwork competencies. Beyond lectures, faculty members actively encouraged us to leverage our individual strengths for diversified professional development. My forthcoming pursuit of a PhD in Urban Ecology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences — transitioning from classrooms overlooking Victoria Harbour to State Key Laboratory — is a direct outcome of my professors' pedagogical dedication and the scholarly capital cultivated during my Master's studies.\nOver the course of two years, the programme has equipped me with both tacit and explicit knowledge in environmental science and engineering. Spanning a diverse range of interdisciplinary subjects, I have explored contemporary issues such as climate change and energy-efficient buildings.\nThe programme consistently delivers a high-quality learning experience with a mix of modes, such as field studies, external sharing by practitioners, and experiential learning. During my studies, I have gained insights into today's challenges and opportunities of creating a sustainable urban environment. This has strengthened my industry knowledge and boosted my confidence in handling ESG-related tasks and projects in the workplace.\nTransitioning from a geography background, into the ESG field was a challenge, but this programme helped fill my knowledge gap and gave me a clear understanding of the subject. Guided by professors, I explored real-world sustainability practices in Hong Kong and abroad, especially concerning the transport and building sectors.

I was taught by professional and enthusiastic lecturers who were happy to help whenever I experienced academic problems. They provided me with effective suggestions and encouragement, as well as guidance on future development directions. I also met many friendly classmates during my studies. I highly recommend the MSc in Geomatics to those interested in learning about this topic and pursuing a related profession.\nI studied a Masters of Geomatics (Surveying) in the LSGI department from 2019 to 2021, before beginning my research career. Through the MSc programme, I took a wide range of subjects, covering urban geo-informatics, smart cities, 3D spatial photogrammetry, spatial big data analytics, global positioning and navigating, planetary mapping, and remote sensing for environmental studies.\nAs a graduate student and PolyU alumnus, I appreciate the opportunities that studying at LSGI provided me, and I encourage students to join the department. I really enjoyed learning from knowledgeable professors with international experience, all of whom encouraged me to explore geomatics and extend the scope of my research. In addition, LSGI’s well-equipped laboratories and advanced equipment were an important support for my research.\nOne-page (for non-local applicants only)\n• Taught Postgraduate\n• Students can pursue their studies in either full-time or part-time mode.

The scheme offers interest-bearing loans to eligible students for covering tuition fees. An administrative fee and a relatively higher interest rate are charged once the loan is drawn down until it is fully repaid. Applications are non-means tested, which means that there is no assessment of family's income and assets. For details of the scheme, please refer to the Government's website at https://www.wfsfaa.gov.hk/sfo/en/postsecondary/enls/overview.htm.\nAlso, there are some PolyU subjects/courses that have been approved for the Continuing Education Fund (CEF). Eligible students (please see here) enrolled in courses included on the Government's list of reimbursable courses may apply for subsidies. Please refer to the Continuing Education Fund website at https://www.wfsfaa.gov.hk/cef/en/index.htm for information.\nNon-local students are not eligible to apply for financial assistance from both the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and PolyU. Please therefore secure sufficient funds before embarking on studies at PolyU.\nScholarships\nEntry scholarships may be provided by individual programme offering departments. Please visit the information on individual programmes listed on Study@PolyU webpage or contact the programme offering department for the scholarship availability and further enquiries.
