Degree\n[HEADING] Ph.D. Degree\n[HEADING] Other Programs\n[HEADING] About\nPenn State   |    College of Engineering\nSearch this site\nSearch Penn State\nSearch PSU People\nSearch PSU Depts.\nWeb\nThe Penn State Civil and Environmental Engineering Department offers the following graduate degree options: master of engineering (M.Eng.), master of science (M.S.), and doctor of philosophy (Ph.D.). General descriptions for each of these degrees are provided below. Detailed descriptions of the requirements specific to each discipline can be found within the Graduate Handbook.\nAll students in the M.S., M.Eng., and Ph.D. programs must complete Scholarship and Research Integrity (SARI) requirements.\nThe SARI program at Penn State is designed to offer graduate students comprehensive, multilevel training in the responsible conduct of research, through a three-part program: an online course that must be completed in the first year of graduate study, a three-hour colloquium, CE 590, and two hours that can be completed by attending Office of Research Protection seminars.\nThe M.Eng. degree is intended to be a professional degree composed of a well-balanced, unified, and complete program of study leading to advanced professional practice. Students must complete 31 credits of graduate course work (18 credits of which must be at the 500-level) and satisfy the other academic program requirements outlined in the Graduate Handbook. While full-time students can complete the program in two semesters, part-time students take longer.\nThe M.S. degree program is a blend of graduate-level course work and research. Students must complete 30 graduate credits (18 credits of which must be at the 500 and/or 600-level, combined and 6 credits must be research-based), prepare and orally defend a thesis, and satisfy the other academic program requirements outlined in the Graduate Handbook.\nThe Ph.D. degree program is strongly oriented toward research. Students must complete 15 credits. In addition to meeting course requirements specific to their discipline, Ph.D. students must also successfully pass the qualifying exam, comprehensive exam, final oral exam, write a dissertation, and satisfy the other academic program requirements outlined in the Graduate Handbook. The duration of the program varies from three to five years depending on the student’s background and professional interests.\nMinimum Course Requirements are dependent on area of specialization:\nApplicants who do not meet these minimum course requirements can still be admitted on a provisional basis until the coursework is completed elsewhere or as part of the graduate studies at Penn State.\nWith a vast number of resources available at Penn State, there are many opportunities for interdisciplinary research, and many of our graduate students choose to pursue joint degrees with other programs.\nThe Penn State Civil and Environmental Engineering Department, established in 1881, is internationally recognized for excellence in the preparation of undergraduate and graduate engineers through the integration of education, research, and leadership.\nPenn State University\nDepartment of Civil & Environmental Engineering\n208 Engineering Collaborative Research and Education (ECoRE) Building\n556 White Course Dr\nUniversity Park, PA 16802-1408\nPhone: 814-863-3084\n• Directory\n• Apply\n• Research\n\n\n\n\nResearch Areas\nInfrastructure Resilience and Adaptation\nDecarbonization of the Built Environment\nSafe and Equitable Mobility Systems\nSustainable Water Management Solutions\nAI and Machine Learning for Sustainability Challenges\n\n\n\n\nFacilities and Labs\nResearch Facilities\nResearch Centers and Units\n\n\n\n\nResources\nContact Us\nFaculty Mentoring\nCollege-level Communications Resources\n• Research Areas\n• Infrastructure Resilience and Adaptation\n• Decarbonization of the Built Environment\n• Safe and Equitable Mobility Systems\n• Sustainable Water Management Solutions\n• AI and Machine Learning for Sustainability Challenges\n• Facilities and Labs\n• Research Facilities\n• Research Centers and Units\n• Resources\n• Contact Us\n• Faculty Mentoring\n• College-level Communications Resources\n• People\n\n\n\n\nFaculty\nAcademic Faculty\nAffiliate Faculty\nPostdocs and Research Associates\nAdjunct Instructors\nEmeritus Faculty\n\n\n\n\nStaff\nComplete Staff\n\n\n\n\nAdministration\nContact Us\n• Faculty\n• Academic Faculty\n• Affiliate Faculty\n• Postdocs and Research Associates\n• Adjunct Instructors\n• Emeritus Faculty\n• Staff\n• Complete Staff\n• Administration\n• Contact Us\n• Academics\n\n\n\n\nUndergraduate\nProspective Students\nMajors, Minors, and Certificates\n Scholarships & Financial Aid\nSample Academic Plan\nOnline Summer Courses\nResearch Opportunities\nStudy Abroad\nUndergraduate Handbook\n\n\n\n\nGraduate\nProspective Students\n Research Areas\nDegrees and Requirements\nCourse Information\nFellowships and Funding\nGraduate Handbook\nGraduate Life\nHow to Apply\n\n\n\n\nResources\nAdvising\nCareer Resources\nCourses\nAcademic Calendar\nStudent Organizations\nMentoring Programs\nAccreditation\nComputing Policy\nVisitors\nHousing\nLife in Happy Valley\n\n\n\n\nEvents\nThomas C.

      "content": "What is Operations Research?\nOperations Research (OR) is the analysis-usually involving treatment-of a process, problem, or operation to determine its purpose and effectiveness and to gain maximum efficiency. The strength and versatility of OR lie in its ability to model the behavior of complex systems in quantitative mathematical terms, as well as its prescriptive power through analysis and synthesis.\nOperations Research is interdisciplinary by nature and draws on the techniques from many fields, including the mathematical sciences, engineering, the solution economics, and the physical sciences.\nAbout the Program\nThe Dual-title Intercollege Graduate Degree Program is housed in the Harold and Inge Marcus Department of Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering. Students enrolled in participating graduate programs at Penn State may pursue a dual graduate degree (at either the Ph.D. or Master’s level) in OR at the same time they are meeting the requirements of their “home” graduate program. Doctoral and Master’s students can also earn a minor in OR.\n“There are methodological links between OR and Statistics that remain unexplored. My dual degree lays the groundwork for a future in either academia or industry, interweaving Statistics’ sophisticated analysis with OR’s computational efficiency.”\n– Ana Keeney, Ph.D. student in Statistics and OR",

The heavy and vertical construction industry provides millions of jobs and accounts for a significant fraction of annual GDP in the United States.\nThis funding will permanently support a full-time, teaching focused professorship in civil construction. The hired person will have a substantial record of industry leadership and experience and will teach courses in construction and related areas, including possible participation in the department's capstone design program. Each year, the hired person will teach a large fraction of our undergraduate student population, which currently totals nearly 500 students pursuing a BSCE degree.\nAs of February 2021, there are currently commitments from thirteen leading construction companies as stakeholders in the new CEM program, at a level of $100,000 each. Through this generous support, as well as a $750,000 gift from The Beavers Charitable Trust and an additional $150,000 gift from Allan Myers, Inc, $2.2 million has been raised toward the $3 million goal to establish The Beavers Charitable Trust and Allan Myers Endowed Professorship in Civil Construction Engineering and Management.\nLearn More>>\nFundraising Team:\nDiontre EarlSr. Director of Major Gifts, College of Engineeringdle22@psu.edu\nPatrick FoxCEE Department Headpjf14@psu.edu\nRobert E.

Jeffrey and Ann Marie Fox Graduate School Online Application\n*Please note: If you intend to apply to a graduate program in environmental engineering, please select the ENV ENG application, not the CIVIL ENG application.\nApplicants recommended for admission will be notified by the Fox Graduate School that official/original transcripts/documents and their official English translation must be sent from the originating institutions for review by the Fox Graduate School to finalize an admission decision. Notarized copies are not sufficient. This step is only required after the application has been reviewed and if the applicant is admitted.\nPlease prepare a personal statement that addresses the following items:\nPLEASE NOTE: TOEFL and GRE scores are to be sent to Penn State electronically via the Fox Graduate School Online Application.\nOnce documents for an application have been received by Penn State, they officially become a University document and cannot be returned to applicants.\nPlease do not submit information with your application that cannot be used in the admission decision process, i.e., Individual Education Plans (IEP), medical records, statement from physicians or psychologists, or legal documents. Such information will be destroyed and will not be included in the application packet.\nThe Penn State Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering accepts graduate applications on a continuous, rolling basis. For strongest consideration of funding, the following deadlines apply:\nCompleted application packages received before mid-December or mid-September will be reviewed for competitive College of Engineering Fellowships and College of Engineering Recruitment Funds; and will receive preferential consideration for Graduate Research Assistantships and Graduate Teaching Assistantships. Applications received after mid-December (for fall) or mid-September (for spring) will be considered for assistantships on a waiting list basis only. A completed application package consists of all items listed on the Graduate Application page. Applicants are advised to begin the application process early to make sure that the application and supporting documents arrive in time for the deadlines.\nIncomplete applications lacking any of the listed application items will not be reviewed by the admissions committee and will not be considered for funding.\nApplications completed by the December deadline (fall) will be reviewed by the Admissions Committee and decisions emailed during early March. Applications completed after the December deadline will be reviewed on a rolling basis with decisions emailed as the reviews are completed.\nApplications completed by the September deadline (spring) will be reviewed by the Admissions Committee and decisions emailed during mid to late October.\nWhen an application is approved by the Admissions Committee, the following occurs through different Penn State offices.\nThe Penn State Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering receives many more applications from qualified students than can be advised or funded for a master of science (M.S.) thesis. Thus, a certain number of master's applicants may be admitted into the non-thesis program master of engineering (M.Eng.), which would require that the student be able to provide self-support for the 30-credit M.Eng. degree.\nThe Admissions Committee carefully reviews each application and discusses the potential of each applicant.

If you plan to pursue employment in a licensed profession after completing this program, please visit the Professional Licensure/Certification Disclosures by State interactive map.\nThe following specializations are available:\nGraduating seniors must add the minor by the University’s deadline during the semester in which they intend to graduate (refer to the registrar’s academic calendar).\nProgram Description: Penn State’s Environmental Engineering Minor is an interdisciplinary program administered by the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. This minor is designed to provide students in engineering, science, and other majors with a comprehensive study of environmental issues and the skills necessary to solve problems associated with environmental pollution. A certificate is awarded to students who complete the requirements of the minor.\nPrerequisites: For entrance into the minor, students must be:\nRequirements: To complete the minor, students must complete 18 credits in approved courses. At least 6 credits must be in 400-level courses and 6 credits that apply toward the minor must be unique from credits used to earn any other major or minor. A grade of C or better is required for all courses in the minor. *For students entering Penn State after Spring 2016, at least six (6) credits of the minor must be unique from the Prescribed Courses required by the student’s major program(s). For a complete list of requirements, see the University Bulletin.\nAdding the Minor: To add the minor, log into LionPath and select “Update Academics” from the academic drop-down menu and click the double arrow “Go” icon. Read the following page instructions, then click the “Continue” button. Use the tool to add the minor.\nMore Information: Specific questions regarding the minor may be directed to Nathaniel Warner, environmental engineering minor adviser, nrw6@psu.edu.\nThe objective of the Residential Construction Minor is to provide an opportunity for students to gain an understanding of residential building construction topics and issues with an emphasis on sustainable land development, design, and construction of residential buildings, as well as construction management of residential projects.\nResidential building construction is a unique interdisciplinary field that draws upon civil and architectural engineering, architecture, real estate, management, finance, and marketing disciplines, and design principles including economical, safe, and serviceable structural design, green building systems design, sustainable land development, and construction management.\nThis minor is expected to be primarily of interest to student from civil and environmental engineering, architectural engineering, and architecture majors, but students from other majors can also enroll in this minor. This minor will help students to increase their competitiveness for employment in the residential market and construction industry.\nMinor Requirements: The minor consists of 22 credits – 10 required credits and 12 additional credits. The 12 additional credits are based on four (4) tracks: architectural engineering, architecture, civil engineering, and all other majors. A grade of C or better is required in all courses in the minor. Students must also maintain at least a 2.0 GPA.\nApplication Form: Download the application form here: Residential Construction Minor Application Form\nSpecific questions regarding the minor may be directed to Mindy Boffemmyer, PHRC, mub21@psu.edu or Jaymes Dunlap, architectural engineering, jad6832@psu.edu.\nFor more information about the minor, click here.\nProgram Description: This program is designed to provide undergraduate students with a means of developing some basic knowledge of housing and preparing for a career in the housing industry.\nHousing, from low-rise detached houses to multi-unit, multi-story apartment buildings, from motels to high-rise hotels, from student residences to rural housing, is a major and vital component of the built environment. New single-family housing represents at least 4 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP), and housing and its consequences account for about 12 percent of the GDP. With a national housing stock in excess of 110,000,000 units, the maintenance, operation, repair – and especially the upgrading, retrofit, and remodeling of the existing stock – are a very important component of the national economy. Engineers have many important roles to play in the housing business, especially with the developmental, economic, and technical aspects of housing.\nThe certificate program consists of courses that already exist, but the objective is to ensure that a minimum program of related courses is completed. It is recommended that the student take a set of complementary courses in the technology of housing, and/or the development process, and/or the design and the delivery processes and/or the real estate process. A certificate is to be awarded to students who complete the requirements. For entrance into the certificate program, students must be at least fifth-semester standing. The GPA considered for admission will be consistent with or equivalent to the GPA required for entrance to any major in the student’s department. To continue in the program, students must earn a C grade or better in each required course.
