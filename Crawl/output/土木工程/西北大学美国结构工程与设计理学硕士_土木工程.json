Engineers design novel infrastructure systems to be adaptive, resilient, and sustainable. The structural engineering and design specialization for Northwestern's civil and environmental engineering master of science degree provides you with the tools, methods, and preparation to meet the challenges of this renaissance.\nThe program builds on the strengths of the world-renowned structural mechanics faculty and elite Chicago-based structural design firms. The theoretical and behavioral study of structures is complemented with design courses and projects taught by registered PE/SE.\nThe Structural Engineering and Design specialization consists of 12 courses, four of which form a core of required fundamental courses. Students must also select a Professional track — either the Design track or the Research track. Each track consists of three courses, and students commit to one track or the other, and complete the sequence of courses. The remaining five courses are selected from a group of approved electives, based on the student's career objectives and interests.\nView the curriculum\nProfessional development seminars are organized specifically structural engineering and design students. This includes resume workshops hosted by engineers, and project presentations by structural engineering and associated professionals. In addition, the department organizes two career fairs annually to connect students to employers and support students to attend the annual steel conference.\nAlumni who have studied in the structural engineering and design specialization hold structural design positions in Chicago, across the US, and around the world, with companies including AECOM, Amazon, Arcadis, Armor Tower, ATMI, BUCG, Chicago Transit Authority, China National Offshore Oil Company, DiDi, DiSimone Consulting Engineers, DRPILLA Associates, Drucker Zajdel Structural Engineers, Gace Consulting Engineers, Gilbane Building Co., HOK, Huarui Welding & Cutting Company, HydroChina Chengdu Engineering Corporation, Jacobs, KPFF, Larson Engineering, Magnusson Klemencic Associates, MWRD, R.M. Byrd and Associates, Reigstad, SidePlate Systems, Simpson, Gumpertz & Heger, Inc., Tencent, Thornton Tomasetti, VAA, and WSP. Our program organizes an annual alumni panel, which features graduates of the program sharing their engineering experience.\nSome of our MS graduates go on to pursue a PhD degree at universities such as Johns Hopkins University, Northwestern University, Tufts University, University of Connecticut, University of Pennsylvania, University of Washington and the University of Wisconsin, Madison. We have also had an alum continue on to earn a law degree at Northwestern University.\nStudents studying structural engineering and design earn a master of science in civil engineering through Northwestern University's Graduate School. To be admitted to the MS program, the student must meet one of the following requirements:\nA BS degree in civil engineering or closely related engineering, OR\nA non-engineering degree, but with coursework covering mathematics through differential equations, first-year, college-level physics, statics and dynamics, mechanics of materials, structural analysis or mechanics, and soil mechanics.\nThese course requirements for admission may be met at Northwestern, but credits from these courses cannot be applied to the graduate degree. In addition, each applicant must meet the usual requirements of The Graduate School and the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering.\nContact us with questions about this specialization at civil-info@northwestern.edu.\nGiuseppe BuscarneraProfessor of Civil and Environmental Engineering,Director of Graduate Studies,Phone: +1 847 491 5884Email Professor Buscarnera\n• Join a new generation of structural designers\n• Experience a broad curriculum in theory and practice\n• Learn cutting-edge design techniques from leading Chicago AE firms\n• Lead design in sustainable infrastructure systems\n• Design for urban development and renewal\n• Create longer, taller, and lighter structures of the future\n• Make industry contacts and network through seminars and career fairs\n• A BS degree in civil engineering or closely related engineering, OR\n• A non-engineering degree, but with coursework covering mathematics through differential equations, first-year, college-level physics, statics and dynamics, mechanics of materials, structural analysis or mechanics, and soil mechanics.\n• Curriculum & Requirements\n• Engineering Home\n• CEE Department\n• Academics\n• Master's Program\n• Structural Engineering and Design Specialization",

A typical study plan includes two years of coursework followed by at least one year of intensive research under faculty supervision.\nThe first year of coursework is similar to that pursued by master of science students. In subsequent years, PhD students delve more deeply into methodological areas related to their research interests through courses in such fields as urban planning, operations research, economics, psychology, marketing, and computer science.\nThe program culminates in PhD dissertation research, which advances the student’s knowledge, perspective, and intellectual maturity, and contributes to the state of the art in transportation.\nPhD students engage in additional seminars guided by faculty teams specifically directed at advanced problem identification, formulation and solution. This close interaction with faculty members provides the PhD student with experiences similar to those faced by professors at research universities or analysts with major research firms and laboratories.\nEmphasis on problem formulation, quantitative skills and communications distinguishes the Northwestern PhD program from those at other universities.\nPhD Handbook\nStudent must maintain a minimum GPA of 3.5 and a good performance on graduate coursework, based on subjective assessment by all transportation systems analysis and planning faculty members.  Student must also have support of at least one faculty member to serve as the research advisor.\nThe initial offer of admission to the PhD program does not guarantee admission to candidacy.\nMore information on the Qualifying Exam here.\nThe prospectus process typically involves development of a written research proposal that will culminate in the dissertation.

This research proposal is also typically delivered in oral form to the prospectus committee.\nReturn to Top\nPhD dissertation research and thesis writing typically takes between three and six years. If a problem arises, students will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. Students must provide an oral defense of their thesis before their dissertation committee, revise their thesis as advised, and receive the approval of each committee member.\nGiuseppe BuscarneraProfessor of Civil and Environmental Engineering,Director of Graduate StudiesPhone: +1 847 491 5884Email Professor Buscarnera\nJean-François Gaillard  Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering Phone: 847 467-1376 Email Professor Jean-François\n• Satisfy The Graduate School’s residency requirement of eight quarters of full‐time registration (defined as registration for a minimum of three units or a maximum of four units during each of the eight quarters).\n• Meet The Graduate School’s requirement for a minimum of nine graduate‐level courses for a letter grade even if entering with an MS degree. Students continuing for the PhD degree after obtaining the MS degree at Northwestern generally are not required to take further courses for a grade, although most do take additional courses because further coursework may be required by your advisor.\n• Complete coursework necessary to prepare for independent research in the student’s research area. The coursework is determined by the student and his or her adviser with advice from the student’s preliminary examination committee.\n• Pass the candidacy exam based on the defense of a short (5 pages) written research proposal. This exam is typically administered in the Fall quarter of the second academic year, just after the student has completed the core courses of the EES program. The next milestone is the defense of a prospectus (full proposal of ~ 15 pages) that takes place after performing one year of full-time research at least.\n• Committees: The candidacy examination committee must be comprised of three TGS faculty, including the anticipated faculty advisor. The prospectus committee must have a minimum of three members who must be TGS faculty. We encourage at least one member from outside the Department and students may have additional members beyond the minimum. Students will provide a yearly update of their progress to their committee in the form of a meeting, a two‐page summary of progress, and short presentation.\n• Complete a program that provides a mentored teaching experience.\n• All PhD students must give at least one environmental engineering and science seminar prior to their formal defense (typically in the fourth year).\n• Successfully present, defend, and submit a PhD dissertation that constitutes a significant and original research contribution.\n• A PhD student should be considered for Admission to PhD Candidacy no earlier than the end of the first academic year (3 quarters) and no later than the end of the second academic year. PhD students must have a research advisor who has agreed to supervise their PhD studies before consideration.\n• For each PhD student, the Program Areas conduct a Qualifying Exam that the student must pass before consideration. The Program Areas are free to choose the form of the Qualifying Exam.\n• Once a quarter, the Program Areas forward a list of the PhD students to be considered for Admission to PhD Candidacy by the CEE Graduate Committee. The Graduate Committee will review the records of all students, and discuss their research potential, and issue approvals. PhD students will be admitted to PhD Candidacy only upon this final approval by the Graduate Committee.\n• Environmental Engineering & Science PhD Specialization\n• Engineering Home\n• CEE Department\n• Academics\n• PhD Program\n• Environmental Engineering and Science Specialization\n• Curriculum and Requirements",

We encourage you to start your engineering career in a Northwestern direction.\nJump to a Section\nNorthwestern's innovative Architectural Engineering and Design (AED) program blends architectural principles and state of the art engineering for unique preparation of whole-brain engineers. Hands-on studio courses are led by practicing architects and engineers from Chicago's world-renown building design community. Students will build a portfolio that demonstrates the deep design skills learned in the program, which prepares them for advanced study in architecture, to be leaders in engineering design, or to pursue careers in a variety of fields related to the design, construction, and management of buildings and other structures.\nIn the McCormick School of Engineering, we empower our students to become whole-brain engineers by integrating elements of left-brain thinking (analysis, logic, and math) with the high-level right-brain thinking that fosters intuition and creativity.\nThe curriculum of the civil and environmental engineering majors are each designed to satisfy diverse interests and professional goals. Students develop study plans that are suited to their unique interests, including extensive options for courses outside the McCormick School to address the social, physical, and financial challenges of constructing and managing the nation’s infrastructure. There is also the opportunity to do a combined BS/MS program.\nTo see available courses, click here.\nThe Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering encourages all students to participate in unique and forward-looking research. Juniors and seniors in the department may participate in independent research projects under the guidance of a faculty member, often participating on a team with graduate students. To learn more about it, click here.\nMany alumni have gone on to have distinguished industry and academic careers. Our alumni are often highlighted in our Alumni Spotlight feature on our News page. Students like Natalee Easthom, Prof. Christina Hemphill Fuller, Liz Trumball, Maya Stuhlbarg, Mehri Paydar, Michael Aronson, Andrew Sonta, Tony Vasquez, Matthew Shaxted, William Oestreich, and Michael Reiner have had their accomplishments featured.\nMany CEE students receive scholarships during their time at Northwestern. Students have been awarded prestigious scholarships from ASCE, Thornton Tomasetti, ACI Foundation, Norman Foster Foundation, American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC), Illinois Section of the American Water Works (ISWWA), Denver Transportation Club, NOAA, and the SEF Undergraduate Scholarship. There have also been alumni who have received Fulbright and Marshall Scholarships.\nWe encourage all students to become active members in student organizations and apply for any internship, co-op, or research opportunity that they are eligible for.\nFrom 2015-2017, members of the CEE department spearheaded Northwestern’s entry in NASA’s 3D-Printed Habitat Challenge, stretching the body of knowledge surrounding 3D-printing applications. Phase 1 and 2 challenged industry and academia to develop conceptualizations of the first Martian outpost and 3D-print a column, beam, and small roof section using materials found on Mars. In Phase 3, students were taxed with fully designing a constructible Martian habitat and 3D-printing a foundation, walls, and a 1:3 scale habitat…all in under 16 months.\nTwelve McCormick undergraduate students, 9 of whom are CEE majors and 3 are pursuing the new Architectural Engineering & Design minor, teamed up in Fall 2020 to pool their creative talents around Sustainable Building Design. The team, engiNUity, developed the design concept NUHome as their entry to the Department of Energy Solar Decathlon 2021 Design Challenge, a collegiate competition, challenging student teams to design highly efficient and innovative buildings powered by renewable energy, and were finalists.\nIn 2020, three students competed in the Illinois Water Environment Association (IWEA) competition and won 1st place. They then went on to place 3rd nationally at the Water in Environment WEFTEC competition.\nThe civil engineering undergraduate students run their own ASCE chapter for Northwestern. It provides leadership opportunities for the students, as well as professional development and networking. ASCE is heavily involved in both the Fall and Winter CEE Career Fairs, and conduct their own resume workshops as well. They also invite industry professionals to give seminars.\nStudents also participate in the annual ASCE Concrete Canoe Competition, which provides civil engineering students an opportunity to gain hands-on, practical experience and leadership skills by working with concrete mix designs and project management and increases awareness of the value and benefits of ASCE membership among civil engineering students and faculty in order to foster lifelong membership and participation in the Society.\nThe environmental engineering undergraduate students run their own EnvEUS chapter at Northwestern. The mission of EnvEUS is to bring community to the environmental engineering department, promote collaboration, assist in networking, and provide knowledge of potential career paths. They participate in competitions and projects focused on environmental sustainability to give students the opportunity to put classroom skills to practical use.\nNorthwestern Engineering\nCivil & Environmental Engineering\nCEE Academic Coordinator Program Assistant Phone 847-491-7462 Email Academic Coordinator\n• Architectural Engineering and Design Minor\n• Curriculum\n• Undergraduate Research\n• Alumni Careers\n• Department Life\n• Newsletter\n• Undergraduate Study\n• Civil Engineering Major\n• Environmental Engineering Major\n• Environmental Engineering Minor\n• Architectural Engineering & Design Minor\n• Combined BS/MS Program\n• Special Programs\n• Engineering Home\n• CEE Department\n• Academics\n• Undergraduate Study\n• Prospective Undergraduate Students",
