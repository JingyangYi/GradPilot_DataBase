This 9 month program, with opportunities for individualized tracks in CEE – prepares our graduates for addressing significant challenges in the domains of Civil and Environmental Engineering.\nFor current MIT students, the program is a natural extension of the Institute’s 4 year Bachelor of Science degree for students to gain practical experiences and prepare for emerging fields in today’s job market. The MEng program is self-funded. Admitted students are responsible for paying tuition and cost-of-living expenses or securing external fellowships. MIT’s Office of Graduate Education maintains a helpful database of such fellowships on their website.\nThe Master of Engineering Program is self-funded, meaning the Department and Institute do not provide any fellowships, scholarships, research assistantships or teaching assistantships to assist with the cost of the program. Admitted students are responsible for paying all tuition and cost-of-living expenses.\nSummary of Requirements The Master of Engineering degree is awarded to students who have satisfactorily completed a structured program of at least 90 units, consisting of 66 units graduate level subjects, and a 24 unit thesis approved by the department. In one academic year, the students are required to take:\nWhat do students do with their degree? Graduates of the MEng Program go on to careers as leaders in industry, government, consulting, and some pursue further graduate education.\nWithin the Climate, Environment and Sustainability (CES) track of the MEng degree program, students take coursework to develop their understanding of CES and pursue research on CES topics across the breadth of civil and environmental engineering (e.g. ecological systems, air pollution, food, energy). Read our article to learn more about this track.\nCoursework: Within the Climate, Environment, and Sustainability track, students must select 3 of the following subjects:\nWithin the Data Science for Engineering Systems (DSES) track of the MEng degree program, students gain expertise in data science and computational modeling tools for improving the sustainability and resilience of next generation societal-scale infrastructure systems.

A head shot from the shoulders up is best and please make sure your audio is clearly able to be heard.\nVideo Question 2\nAll LGO applicants will be prompted to respond to a randomly generated, open-ended question. The question is designed to help us get to know you better; to see how you express yourself and to assess fit with the MIT Sloan culture. It does not require prior preparation. \nVideo Essay 2 is part of your required application materials and will appear as a page within the application, once the other parts of your application are completed. Applicants are given 5 seconds to prepare for a 60-second response.\nShort Answer Question\nThe Admissions Committee is excited to learn more about you and your background. In 250 words, please respond to the following short answer question:\nHow has the world you come from shaped who you are today? For example, your family, culture, community, all help to shape aspects of your life experiences and perspective. Please use this opportunity to share more about your background.\nOrganizational Chart\nTo help us better understand your current role and the impact that you have on your team and department, please submit an organizational chart. We should be able to clearly understand the internal structure of your organization, where you sit in your organization, and your line of reporting. You can learn more about the specifics of the organizational chart on Sloan’s MBA application instructions.\nLetters of recommendation\nLGO applicants must submit two letters of recommendation, one professional and one technical, with the option of submitting a third additional technical recommendation letter.\nOne professional recommendation is required from an individual who is able to speak with certainty about your professional achievements and potential. Your professional recommendation should reflect your leadership and teamwork skills and should follow the recommendation guidelines on the Sloan application site.\nYour second recommendation should be a technical reference from someone who has worked with you on significant engineering and technical projects or coursework, and can speak to your ability to carry out advanced engineering research and projects. Examples of recommenders for the technical reference include a previous professor, a manager or senior colleague who is in a technical role such as chief engineer or data scientist. We prefer and encourage an academic source when possible. Your recommender should assess your academic and technical skills, particularly regarding analytical acumen, technical expertise and depth, quantitative problem solving, and the ability to look deeply into a technical problem. This letter can follow the MIT Sloan recommendation prompts, but we are looking for answers specifically to the following additional questions:\n\nPlease give an example of an engineering/technical project or challenge that the applicant faced, and the resources they used in addressing it.\nAssess this applicant’s ability to continue graduate education in an engineering field, based on your observations of how this candidate addresses advanced technical coursework and problems.\n\nPlease navigate to the Recommendation Letter section of the application and add your recommender’s contact information; they will be sent instructions on how to submit their letter.\nPlease note: We strongly encourage submitting an additional technical letter of recommendation if feasible. Additional insights into your technical abilities and problem solving skills can further strengthen your application, as long as they are from a recommender who can provide specific examples. Keep in mind we will review all submitted material as is and without negative inferences if candidates do not submit a 3rd recommendation.\n[CARD]\nInterviews\nInterviews will be scheduled by invitation only, after an initial evaluation of a complete application. We only interview a select number of candidates who apply, but receiving an invitation to interview does not guarantee admission. For the foreseeable future all admission interviews will be conducted virtually, and we will contact you with more information.\nThose invited to interview will be prompted to submitted two short essay questions in advance of the interview. More details will be shared in the interview invitation.\n[CARD]\nInterviews\nInterviews\n[CARD]\nInterviews\n[CARD]\nInterviews will be scheduled by invitation only, after an initial evaluation of a complete application.
