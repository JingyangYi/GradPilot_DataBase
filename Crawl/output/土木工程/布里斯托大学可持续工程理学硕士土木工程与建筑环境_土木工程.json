This programme will provide you with the theoretical and practical knowledge to create and maintain a more sustainable world within your chosen area of engineering.\nThis degree combines foundational knowledge and skills in sustainable engineering with a specialism in one of three pathways:\nA unique feature of our programme is that the dissertations are researched and written in groups, with each individual student making their own contribution. As such, you will decide on the topic with your group members and under the guidance of staff. This approach of working with other engineers, who may be on different pathways, reflects real-life engineering.\nHear directly from an academic giving you a deeper insight into this programme.\nOur four core units focus on developing skills and knowledge in sustainable engineering, in addition to providing a foundation for completing the research-based dissertation project.\nIn the first term, the Sustainable Systems unit offers you an overview and appreciation of the complex challenges associated with creating sustainable systems, providing the ‘big picture’ context in which we engineer solutions.\nIn the second term, the Sustainable Design unit focuses on the delivery of real and impactful sustainable solutions, including the design tools that can be used to assist you in making sustainable decisions (for example, lifecycle analysis tools, sustainability checklists, sustainability software tools).\nTwo other core units (Innovation, Entrepreneurship and Enterprise in the first term and Research Skills in the second term) further prepare you to complete the supervised group dissertation project.\nYou will also take two pathway-specific units, which will allow you to further specialise in your chosen area of engineering.\nVisit our programme catalogue for full details of the structure and unit content for our MSc in Sustainable Engineering.\nThe University of Bristol is ranked fifth for research in the UK (Times Higher Education).\n94% of our research assessed as world-leading or internationally excellent.\nYou will typically need an upper second-class honours degree or international equivalent in an Engineering or Engineering-related subject, including Computer Science, Maths, Physics, Technology/Technological based subjects.\nIf you are currently completing a degree, we understand that your final grade may be higher than the interim grades or module/unit grades you have achieved during your studies to date.\nWe will consider your application if your interim grades are currently slightly lower than the programme's entry requirements and may make you an aspirational offer. This offer would be at the standard level, so you would need to achieve the standard entry requirements by the end of your degree.\nWe will also consider your application if your final overall achieved grade is slightly lower than the programme's entry requirement.\nIf you have at least one of the following, please include your CV (curriculum vitae / résumé) when you apply, showing details of your relevant qualifications:\nSee international equivalent qualifications on the International Office website.\nRead the programme admissions statement for important information on entry requirements, the application process and supporting documents required.\nIf English is not your first language, you will need to reach the requirements outlined in our profile level E.\nFurther information about English language requirements and profile levels.\nFees are subject to an annual review. For programmes that last longer than one year, please budget for up to an 8% increase in fees each year.\nMore about tuition fees, living costs and financial support.\nUniversity of Bristol students and graduates can benefit from a 25% reduction in tuition fees for postgraduate study. Check your eligibility for an alumni discount.\nFurther information on funding for prospective UK and international postgraduate students.\nThis programme will give you the knowledge, skills, and tools to be successful in creating sustainable engineering solutions in a variety of industries and settings. Depending on your chosen pathway and your individual interests, you could go on to work as a civil, structural, or mechanical engineer in an engineering firm; a renewable energy consultant; in product development; or in government.\nApply today via our online application system.

We refer to these skill levels as ‘profiles’. The profile for your chosen course or programme is shown on the course page or programme page.\nThe tests and levels you need to achieve to meet the requirements are on each English language profile page.\nEnglish language proficiency tests should be obtained within two years of the start date of your programme or course.\nIf you are from, or have studied in, an English-speaking country, you may not need to provide additional evidence of your English language ability.\nEnglish language qualifications must be presented in English. If the qualification evidence is not in English you must provide a professional or certified translation, including the contact details for the translator or translation company.\nYou do not need to have reached the required level before you apply.\nWe will look at your academic qualifications and decide what offer we will make you. If you haven’t yet reached the required English level, we will give you a target grade to meet as part of your offer.\nIf you have the required level, you must include it in your application. You do not need to do anything else. If you are a national of an English-speaking country as defined by UK Visas and Immigration, then you may be considered to have the required level. You can find further details, including the list of these countries, in each of our English language profiles.\nIf you haven’t reached the required level for your course or programme, you will be given a target grade in your offer.\nYou will need to provide a valid English language qualification showing you have met the required target grade.\nIf you don’t have the required level, you can try one of the following:\n• Taking a pre-sessional language course offered by the University\n• Taking an IELTS Academic test\n• Taking a different course in your home country which qualifies (see the list under the profile)\n• Re-sitting the language tests in your home country to reach the required level.",
