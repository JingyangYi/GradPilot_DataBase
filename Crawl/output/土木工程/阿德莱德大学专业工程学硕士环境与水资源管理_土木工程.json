environmental conservation. They develop sustainable solutions to mitigate pollution, manage natural resources and address the impacts of climate change.  \nYou could consult on ecosystem restoration projects, helping to restore natural habitats and ensure their long-term sustainability. Maybe you’ll pioneer a new waste-to-energy technology, significantly decreasing our reliance on landfills for waste disposal. Or perhaps you’ll specialise in the use of nanomaterials to remove contaminants from drinking water at a molecular level.  \nWhatever your career goals, we’ll ensure there is a path for you. You could work in a wide range of sectors including:    \nAgriculture and irrigation Construction and infrastructure Energy and utilities Environmental consulting Environmental protection agencies Forestry and land management Government and regulatory agencies Manufacturing and industry Mining and resources extraction Oil and gas Public health departments Research and development Transportation and logistics Waste management and recycling Water supply and wastewater treatment. \nIndustry trends \nGreater environmental regulatory demands, an increased push towards sustainability and the adoption of smart technologies are driving transformation in the environmental engineering sector. Environmental engineers are developing advanced water treatment technologies to ensure steady supply of clean and safe drinking water. They are utilising smart technologies to monitor air pollution levels in real-time. They might design buildings able to withstand the impacts of climate change.

They develop sustainable solutions to mitigate pollution, manage natural resources and address the impacts of climate change.  \nYou could consult on ecosystem restoration projects, helping to restore natural habitats and ensure their long-term sustainability. Maybe you’ll pioneer a new waste-to-energy technology, significantly decreasing our reliance on landfills for waste disposal. Or perhaps you’ll specialise in the use of nanomaterials to remove contaminants from drinking water at a molecular level.  \nWhatever your career goals, we’ll ensure there is a path for you. You could work in a wide range of sectors including:    \nAgriculture and irrigation Construction and infrastructure Energy and utilities Environmental consulting Environmental protection agencies Forestry and land management Government and regulatory agencies Manufacturing and industry Mining and resources extraction Oil and gas Public health departments Research and development Transportation and logistics Waste management and recycling Water supply and wastewater treatment. \nIndustry trends \nGreater environmental regulatory demands, an increased push towards sustainability and the adoption of smart technologies are driving transformation in the environmental engineering sector. Environmental engineers are developing advanced water treatment technologies to ensure steady supply of clean and safe drinking water. They are utilising smart technologies to monitor air pollution levels in real-time. They might design buildings able to withstand the impacts of climate change. They’re spearheading solutions to the pressing need to reduce waste and landfill dependency. Environmental engineers with the expertise to lead these and many other essential projects are in high demand by employers. \nAccreditation\nThis program is currently undergoing assessment for accreditation by Engineers Australia.\nFind your program\n    \nDiscover the programs and explore the opportunities.\n\n\n\n        Explore our programs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Check the requirements\n    \nLook out for any prerequisite or assumed knowledge courses.

The course will build on principles of hydrology and hydraulics to cover aspects of green infrastructure and WSUD, with an emphasis on water harvesting and vegetation.
