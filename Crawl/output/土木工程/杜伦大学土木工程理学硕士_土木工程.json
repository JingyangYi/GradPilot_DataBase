They work as consultants, technology analysts, and software developers and as entrepreneurs, and also gain prestigious positions in banking and finance.\nThe Department has a dedicated careers contact who is available to offer advice and carry out mock interviews.\nOur Industrial Partnership Committee of around 20 local, national and international companies will ensure you have access to the best employment opportunities.\n\n\n\n\r\n    Department information\r\n  \n\n\n\r\n  Engineering\r\n\n\nEngineering at Durham combines dynamic teaching led by subject experts with opportunities to carry out cutting-edge engineering research. Our courses provide the skills to plan, design and analyse innovative and forward-thinking projects that will meet the demands of industry.The Department of Engineering is a general engineering department that works on the principle that engineering is an integrated subject rather than a series of unconnected topics. The world-leading teaching and the research opportunities that we offer underline this academic positioning.\nWe guide postgraduate researchers so that they are able to make a significant contribution in the Department’s key areas of engineering focus. These topics range from the development of energy systems of the future, through next generation materials and microsystems to creating sustainable infrastructures. All reflect the challenges now facing the modern world.\nTaught courses include MSc qualifications in Advanced Mechanical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Electronic Engineering and Renewable and Sustainable Energy. We also offer the Doctor of Philosophy and the Master of Science by Research, which involve individualised training and require an extensive research project or thesis to be completed.\nTeaching and supervision are provided by the Department’s subject specialists, who have an outstanding reputation for their expertise. An extensive range of facilities is available to support research work and we have strong and productive links with industry partners, ensuring that the research is relevant and applicable at this challenging yet exciting time to be in engineering.\nFor more information see our department pages. \nFacilities\nThe Department of Engineering features a number of modern dedicated teaching laboratories including the newly refurbished electrical laboratory. Other facilities include a wind tunnel, state-of-the-art clean rooms for experiments in very controlled environments and a geotechnical engineering laboratory.\nAn investment of more than £4 million has boosted the computing resources available, providing large memory and high-end processor machines for projects requiring major computer capacity.\nOur students benefit from the Engineering Open Access area, which was built to facilitate both group work and individual projects.\nThe Department is located on the main campus at Lower Mountjoy, close to the centre of Durham and a UNESCO World Heritage site.\n\n\n\n\n\r\n        Apply\r\n    \n\n\n\nFind out more:\n\n\n\n\nApply for a postgraduate course (including PGCE International) via our online portal.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n        How to Apply?\r\n\r\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n              Applicant Portal (not PGCE unless International)\r\n\r\n              \n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n              Admissions Policy\nTuition fees\r\n      \n\n\nHome students\n\r\n            £14,500 per year\r\n          \n\n\nEU students\n\r\n            £33,000 per year\r\n          \n\n\nIsland students\n\r\n            £14,500 per year\r\n          \n\n\nInternational students\n\r\n            £33,000 per year\nApply for a postgraduate course (including PGCE International) via our online portal.\nHow to Apply?\r\n\r\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n              Applicant Portal (not PGCE unless International)\r\n\r\n              \n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n              Admissions Policy\nHow to Apply?\r\n\r\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n              Applicant Portal (not PGCE unless International)\r\n\r\n              \n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n              Admissions Policy\nVisit Us\r\n    \n\nThe best way to find out what Durham is really like is to come and see for yourself!\n\n\n\r\n        Events and Open Days\nJoin a Postgraduate Open Day\r\n      \n\nDate: 10/02/2025 -

It provides entry to a wide range of degree subjects for learners from some under-represented groups in higher education (check Eligibility), who need a year 0 course in order to be prepared for undergraduate studies.\nFoundation Programme courses are fully integrated elements of Durham University degree programmes and students are full members of the university. This means they become members of a college and enjoy full access to the extensive extracurricular opportunities within the university right from day one.\nStudents who successfully reach the progression standard by the end of the foundation year automatically gain entry to year one of their registered degree course without the need for a further UCAS application.\nThe majority of our students are from non-traditional university backgrounds. Many are from the North East of England, though all regions of the UK are usually represented. Foundation Programme staff are experts at teaching foundation level courses and are engaged in a wide range of scholarship activities, adding to the body of knowledge within their respective discipline areas and in the field of learning and teaching.\nThere are many types of foundation year. At Durham, the foundation year is a 'year 0' element of an undergraduate degree programme that is designed for students from some under-represented groups in higher education, who have the potential to achieve the standard for admission to Durham, but who, as a result of educational disadvantage or disruption, do not have the level of attainment or access to qualifications required for entry to a Durham University course.\nAll Foundation Programmes are delivered by a dedicated team of academic tutors from Durham’s Centre for Academic Development (DCAD). Each year the Programmes provide places for around 100 students and supports them to progress to Level 1 study in 33 academic subjects from every academic department in the University. Foundation students matriculate fully into the university, including becoming a member of one of the 17 colleges open to undergraduate students.\nMany degree courses are available 'with foundation'. Discover if the subject you wish to study has a foundation year by searching the University’s course database. This will enable you to see if your chosen degree subject is available with a foundation year.

You can find more about foundation programme modules here.\nFoundation Programme also organises (subject to staff availability and funding) educational field trips to Beamish, Howarth, Newcastle and Czech Republic.\nThe tuition fees for a foundation year in 2025/26 are £5760 for classroom based subjects and £9535 for non-classroom based subjects. Non-classroom based subjects include Biology, Computer Sciences, Archaeology, Geography, Sports Science, and Psychology based routes.
