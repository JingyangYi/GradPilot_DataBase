They are confirmed in the Autumn for students starting in the following academic year and are subject to change each year.\nFor those studying for more than one year, our fees are expected to increase modestly in line with Consumer Price Inflation measured in March each year. More information can be found on our Student Finance webpages.\nThe fee stated for a full-time Masters will usually be the total fee for a one-year programme. Fees for part-time and modular programmes (where available) are pro-rata.\nWill I pay the ‘Home’ or ‘International’ fee?\nThe fees charged for study at the University of Exeter fall broadly into two categories:\nYour fee status classification depends on whether you meet certain criteria such as having ‘settled status’ in the UK and meeting a three year ordinary residence requirement. Full information can be found on the UK Council for International Student Affairs (UKCISA) website.\nFrom 1 August 2021 the eligibility rules for Home fee status have changed for EU Students. Please refer to the UK Government website to see how this change affects you. Where EU students are not eligible for Home fees, they will be required to pay International fees.\nDue to the Common Travel Area arrangement, Irish Nationals living in the UK or Ireland will be eligible for Home fee status; further information around eligibility is available at the above UKCISA link.\nPlease note that the University is unable to determine the fee status of an individual until after an application has been received and we are in receipt of full information concerning individual circumstances. This will then inform the decision as to whether a fee status assessment should be conducted.\nWhat happens if I think my fee status is incorrect?\nIf you have received an offer and you think your fee status is incorrect you have 28 days, from the date of your offer, to query your status. To query your fee status within the 28 day period please contact us at ad-feestatus@exeter.ac.uk stating your full name, Exeter student number, programme for which you have been made an offer and providing details of why you think the fee classification is incorrect.\nCan I request an appeal?\nIf you have queried your fee status within 28 days of receiving your offer and disagree with the outcome, you may request an appeal. Appeals can be submitted either by the applicant or by a nominated decision-maker, and must be made in writing to the Admissions Fees, Funding and Finance Officer at ad-feestatus@exeter.ac.uk.\nYou should only submit an appeal if one or both of the following apply:\nThe appeal will be reviewed by a panel comprising at least two members of staff:\nEach panel member will review the case independently before meeting to discuss their conclusions. The final decision will be communicated in writing to the applicant by the Admissions Fees, Funding and Finance Officer (or their representative).\nI expect my circumstances to change prior to the first day of the first academic year of the course. Will my fee status change?\nWe base our decisions on an applicant’s residence status at time of application and do not hold applications or make offers conditional on fee status. If you are classified as an international student but your situation changes before you have received a decision on your application or after receiving an offer we will conduct a fee reassessment. You will need to submit your new information before 1 September in the year the programme starts, e.g. evidence of British Citizenship or Indefinite Leave to Remain being granted.\nCan my fee status change after the course has started?\nThere are some circumstances where fee status can change in subsequent years, however this is very unusual.\nIf you think you have become entitled to ‘Home’ fees in time for the next year of your course please contact us at ad-feestatus@exeter.ac.uk giving full details of your updated status.\nThe full eligibility criteria can be found on the UK Council for International Student Affairs (UKCISA) website.\nInformation for Channel Islands/Isle of Man students\nFrom the 2021/22 academic year, new and continuing students living in the Crown Dependencies (the ‘Islands’), who come to England solely for the purposes of higher or further education study, will be eligible for home fee status, on the basis of 3 years’ residency in the UK or the Islands. The UK Government confirmed this eligibility in December 2020. For information on support available to you for tuition fees and living costs you should contact your island education offices.\nPlease visit our Student Finance webpage for Channel Islands students for more information.\nIn addition to tuition fees and living costs, your programme of study may have other costs associated with it, such as laboratory equipment or field trips.\nVisit our scholarships and funding website >>\nWhat if my programme lasts more than one year?\nIf the duration of your chosen programme of study spans more than one academic year, the tuition fees for future years are expected to rise by a modest amount to take account of inflationary pressures. You can view tuition fees for students already studying with us on our Student Finance web pages.\nWhen are my fees due?\nIf you receive an offer of a place on a full-time taught postgraduate programme you will need to pay a tuition fee deposit to confirm your place.\nTuition fees are typically payable in two 50% instalments, normally in September (at the start of your course) and January each year. See our student finance pages for more details.\nHow much will it cost?\nWhen you're studying for a Masters your tuition fee is only one part of the cost of doing a postgraduate degree: you also have to consider accommodation and living costs.\nAccommodation costs will vary depending on whether you live in private or University-owned accommodation. More details regarding accommodation, including costs, are available on our accommodation page.\nThe National Union of Students estimates student living costs, including accommodation, to be approximately £12,000 per year outside London.\nLiving costs are, to some extent, up to you.

The options available may depend on your fee status or other criteria.\nWe’ve provided the information below to help you get started on finding funding opportunities that are available to you.\nGovernment-backed loans for Masters programmes are making postgraduate study a realistic option for the first time in years.\nApply for postgraduate loan\nPhilanthropy, charities and trusts\nOur students have also had success securing funding from a range of local, national and international philanthropic sources, most usually charitable bodies. It's worth investigating parish churches, city councils, and other local bodies, many of which offer scholarships, grants, or bursaries of some kind.\nDetails of charitable trusts and other funding organisations can be found in a number of publications including the Grants Register, published by Palgrave Macmillan, and the Directory of Grant-Making Trusts. These can be found in libraries and university careers services. Most of these organisations make relatively small contributions towards the costs of your studies, but they can augment other sources.\nThe Alternative Guide to Postgraduate Funding Online\nWe have subscribed to the 'Alternative Guide to Postraduate Funding' online guide, which can help you find alternative sources of funding - especially charities - which can make awards (for fees, maintenance, or research costs) to any student regardless of subject, or nationality.\nThe guide contains a huge database of funding opportunities, comprehensive guidance, and numerous tools to help you prepare a winning grant application. The guide is free for all current University of Exeter students and staff; simply select 'logon automatically from campus'.\nLogin to the Alternative Guide to Postgraduate Funding >>\nCrowdfunding\nYou may have seen stories in the press about people crowdfunding to help pay their tuition fees. Crowdfunding services, such as www.studentfunder.com, www.indiegogo.com, or www.hubbub.net, allow you to raise monetary contributions from a large number of people, typically via the internet, and can help you fundraise directly towards the cost of your degree. It's worth researching the options available via these and other services to see if they suit your needs.\nOther websites to search for funding information and opportunities\nExternal funding sources\nThe list below outlines a variety of opportunities for external funding from charities, organisations, governments and businesses.

We may also ask for a tuition fee deposit for our Part-Time MSc Extreme Medicine programme.\nDeposit amounts for 2024/2025 entry\nUK postgraduate loan recipients*\n* Deposit amounts are determined by a number of factors including fee status and programme availability.\nDetails of your deposit amount and the deadline for payment will be included in your official offer from the University and is typically 8-weeks from the date of your offer being issued.\nIf you're applying for a UK postgraduate loan, we will automatically extend your deposit deadline until 31 July 2025. All you need to do is tell us this is the case. To do so please contact us via our enquiry form.\nDeposit refund policy\nOnce you have made your deposit payment there will be a 14-day cooling off period from the date the payment was made. Should your circumstances change during these 14 days you can request a deposit refund by contacting us via our enquiry form (please include your full name, programme and Exeter reference number in the email).\nBy making a deposit payment you are agreeing to the terms and conditions of the Deposit Refund Policy. If you have any queries about the deposit payment or refund policy please contact us via our enquiry form.\nAfter the 14-day cooling off period the University of Exeter policy on deposit refunds is that deposits are non-refundable except in cases where:\nDeposits may be refunded in other exceptional circumstances. This would include but is not limited to the following:\nFor all of the above, documentary proof may be required, and decisions are at the University’s entire discretion.\nAll deposit refunds must be requested in writing via our  enquiry form. The request must be submitted along with any evidence within 30 days of the official start date of your programme (start dates can be found on your University of Exeter offer letter).\nPlease note: If you are found to have provided fraudulent or incorrect documentation  in support of your University or UK visa application the above refund policy will not apply. In such circumstances any offer from the University will be invalidated and we will notify the UKVI and retain the deposit payment.\nInformation for applicants applying for a Tier 4 student visa\nUK visa regulations require applicants to demonstrate the ability to pay all costs incurred as a result of study overseas and payment of the deposit demonstrates commitment in this respect. Applicants who need to obtain a Tier 4 student visa will be emailed their Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies statement only when  the deposit and, if applicable, any academic or non academic conditions of our offer have been satisfied. The CAS statement will include both tuition fees due and any advance payments received at the date of issue. Applicants who wish to make larger deposit against their tuition fees can therefore do so at their own discretion but please note the comments below about processing times.\nHow can I pay?\nPlease visit the how to pay pages on our Student Finance website for the different methods of payment. Please note it can take up to 10 working days for your payment to be cleared and for confirmation of receipt to be sent by our Admissions Office.\nIf applicable, it can take a further 5 working days for us to update the UKVI system with the amount received. Offer-Holders needing to apply for a Student Visa should note that we will only send one CAS statement to you so should you wish to pay more than the compulsory deposit we recommend you do so at the same time or wait until you have obtained your Student Visa.\nPlease note that processing these transactions may be delayed at busy times such as around the deposit deadline and the start of term.\nDo I need to pay a deposit if I am sponsored?\nIf you are in receipt of an approved scholarship or studentship covering the full tuition fees and can provide documentary evidence of this, you will be exempt from paying a deposit.\nWill I be refunded my deposit if I defer?\nNo. Your deposit will be rolled over with your application to the next admissions cycle. If you apply to defer for a second year, you will need to reapply and your deposit will not be refunded unless there are extenuating circumstances.\nDo I need to pay a deposit if I am applying for a UK Student Loan?\nIf you're applying for a UK postgraduate loan we will automatically extend your deposit deadline until 31 July 2025. All you need to do is tell us this is the case. To do so please contact us via our enquiry form.\nPlease be aware that if you pay £1,000 of your deposit and subsequently apply for a UK postgraduate loan, that the deposit will be non-refundable except in cases that fall within the policy as outlined above.\nConnect with us\nInformation for:\nQuick links\nStreatham Campus\nSt Luke's Campus\nPenryn Campus\nTruro Campus\n• Current Students website\n• ELE\n• Email web access\n• Make a payment\n• MyExeter (student app)\n• Library\n• SID\n• Timetable\n• Programme and module information\n• Career Zone\n• Current staff website\n• PS Connect Portal\n• SID\n• Email web access\n• Room Bookings\n• Trent\n• Finance Helpdesk\n• IT Service Desk\n• Staff profile support and guidance\n• ELE\n• SRS\n• MI Hub\n• RIME\n• Accommodation\n• Alumni\n• Contacts\n• Graduation\n• Job vacancies\n• Sport\n• Temporary workers\n• Term dates\n• Future Leaders & Innovators Graduate Scheme\n• New students website\n• Returning Students Guide\n• Wellbeing services for students\n• Wellbeing services for staff\n• Equality, Diversity and Inclusion\n• Home\n• Study\n• Postgraduate Taught home\n• Tuition fees and funding\n• Tuition fee deposit\n• Postgraduate Taught home\n• Tuition fees and funding\n• Funding and scholarships\n• Tuition fee deposit\n• A Tier 4 General (Adult) Student visa has been refused.

The CAS statement will include both tuition fees due and any advance payments received at the date of issue. Applicants who wish to make larger deposit against their tuition fees can therefore do so at their own discretion but please note the comments below about processing times.\nHow can I pay?\nPlease visit the how to pay pages on our Student Finance website for the different methods of payment. Please note it can take up to 10 working days for your payment to be cleared and for confirmation of receipt to be sent by our Admissions Office.\nIf applicable, it can take a further 5 working days for us to update the UKVI system with the amount received. Offer-Holders needing to apply for a Student Visa should note that we will only send one CAS statement to you so should you wish to pay more than the compulsory deposit we recommend you do so at the same time or wait until you have obtained your Student Visa.\nPlease note that processing these transactions may be delayed at busy times such as around the deposit deadline and the start of term.\nDo I need to pay a deposit if I am sponsored?\nIf you are in receipt of an approved scholarship or studentship covering the full tuition fees and can provide documentary evidence of this, you will be exempt from paying a deposit.\nWill I be refunded my deposit if I defer?\nNo. Your deposit will be rolled over with your application to the next admissions cycle. If you apply to defer for a second year, you will need to reapply and your deposit will not be refunded unless there are extenuating circumstances.\nDo I need to pay a deposit if I am applying for a UK Student Loan?\nIf you're applying for a UK postgraduate loan we will automatically extend your deposit deadline until 31 July 2025.

Before you start:\nTip 2: Tailor it to the course\nNo-one wants to read a statement that feels like it’s a copied from a template so make sure you tailor your statement to the course.\nOur admissions tutors will be looking for:\nTip 3: Keep it simple\nGetting your points across clearly is much easier when you don’t overcomplicate things. The following tips should help:\nTip 4: Show your enthusiasm\nTell us what you love about your subject and the programme you’re applying for – we want to know why you’re the perfect candidate for the course. Make sure you cover:\nIf you're applying for a subject in a different field from your undergraduate degree, tell us why you’ve decided to change direction.\nTip 5: Give it some structure\nUse a tight structure and make sure each paragraph flows logically. You should:\nWhen you’re happy with it, submit your application online.

Please send as many of the required supporting documents as possible with your application; as a minimum to enable us to make an initial decision on your application, you will need to:\n(a) complete the Module Information section of the application form giving details of any outstanding modules and your expected date of completion;\n(b) send any interim transcripts that you have to support your application.\nIf you have not yet completed your academic or English language qualifications, if your academic profile meets our requirements, we will normally be able to make you an offer which is conditional on completing these qualification/s and supplying a reference. You will need to provide evidence that you have met these conditions before your offer can be considered unconditional.\nWe recommend uploading all supporting documents with your application as this makes the process much quicker and enables us to make a faster decision on your application.\nYou can apply before completing all of your academic qualifications but you will need to provide any interim transcripts that you have to support your application.\nIf you are an international student and you have not yet completed your academic or English language qualifications we will normally be able to make you an offer on condition on completing these and supplying any required references. You will need to provide documentary evidence that you have met these conditions before your offer can be considered unconditional.\nWe do not require original copies at the application stage and would not recommend that you send these during the application process. Please note that ALL international students will need to show original or certified copies of academic qualification/s and (if applicable) an English Language qualification at registration along with your current passport and (if appropriate) student visa.\nConnect with us\nInformation for:\nQuick links\nStreatham Campus\nSt Luke's Campus\nPenryn Campus\nTruro Campus\n• Current Students website\n• ELE\n• Email web access\n• Make a payment\n• MyExeter (student app)\n• Library\n• SID\n• Timetable\n• Programme and module information\n• Career Zone\n• Current staff website\n• PS Connect Portal\n• SID\n• Email web access\n• Room Bookings\n• Trent\n• Finance Helpdesk\n• IT Service Desk\n• Staff profile support and guidance\n• ELE\n• SRS\n• MI Hub\n• RIME\n• Accommodation\n• Alumni\n• Contacts\n• Graduation\n• Job vacancies\n• Sport\n• Temporary workers\n• Term dates\n• Future Leaders & Innovators Graduate Scheme\n• New students website\n• Returning Students Guide\n• Wellbeing services for students\n• Wellbeing services for staff\n• Equality, Diversity and Inclusion\n• Home\n• Study\n• Postgraduate Taught home\n• Entry requirements\n• Supporting documents\n• Postgraduate Taught home\n• Entry requirements\n• English language requirements\n• Supporting documents\n• Reference Form (Word Doc)‌\n• check the entry requirements on the website and research the course content thoroughly.\n• think about how undergraduate study has prepared you for a postgraduate course – perhaps through independent work, work placements or conferences that you've attended.\n• think about why this is the right course for you.\n• an explanation of how the course links your past and future\n• an insight into your abilities, and how they'll fit with the course – think about skills like research, critical thinking, communication, organisation, planning and time-management\n• evidence of your skills, commitment and enthusiasm\n• reasons why you want to study this course at the University of Exeter\n• your particular interest in the subject, perhaps including some academic references.\n• Stick to under 500 words in length\n• Keep your sentences short and clear\n• Consider using headings to break up the content - for example, 'Why the University of Exeter?'

We wish you the best of luck and hope you’ll be joining us at the University of Exeter soon!\n\n\n\n\n\nEssential documentation required for an initial decision on taught programme applications\nWe understand that you will want to receive a decision from us as soon as possible after sending your application but may not yet have completed all your academic and/or English language qualifications at the time of application and will also need time to contact your referee(s). Please send as many of the required supporting documents as possible with your application; as a minimum to enable us to make an initial decision on your application, you will need to:\n(a) complete the Module Information section of the application form giving details of any outstanding modules and your expected date of completion;\n(b) send any interim transcripts that you have to support your application.\nIf you have not yet completed your academic or English language qualifications, if your academic profile meets our requirements, we will normally be able to make you an offer which is conditional on completing these qualification/s and supplying a reference. You will need to provide evidence that you have met these conditions before your offer can be considered unconditional. \nCan I send my supporting documentation in after my application?\nWe recommend uploading all supporting documents with your application as this makes the process much quicker and enables us to make a faster decision on your application.\nYou can apply before completing all of your academic qualifications but you will need to provide any interim transcripts that you have to support your application.\nInternational students\nIf you are an international student and you have not yet completed your academic or English language qualifications we will normally be able to make you an offer on condition on completing these and supplying any required references. You will need to provide documentary evidence that you have met these conditions before your offer can be considered unconditional.\nWe do not require original copies at the application stage and would not recommend that you send these during the application process. Please note that ALL international students will need to show original or certified copies of academic qualification/s and (if applicable) an English Language qualification at registration along with your current passport and (if appropriate) student visa.\n1. A transcript\nWe will need a  transcript (in English or a certified translation) giving full details of subjects studied and grades/marks obtained.\nPlease send scanned or certified copies of transcripts and not the originals*; however, in order to apply for a UK student visa and register at the start of your programme, you will need to produce your original certificates and transcripts. \n*The University cannot guarantee the return of original documents, We therefore request that you do not send original documentation during the admissions process and should you choose send originals you do so at your own risk.\n2. English language proficiency results\nIf you are not a national of a majority English-speaking country you will need to submit evidence of your proficiency in English to the UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) and University's required standards.\n3. One completed reference\nThe following forms can be used but endorsed references will also be accepted (see below):\n\nReference Form (Word Doc)‌\n\nPlease check whether one or two references are required for the programme for which you are applying.\nYou should supply at least one reference from an academic referee who is in a position to comment on the standard of your academic work and suitability for postgraduate level study. Where this is not possible, we will accept references from other sources that provide evidence of your ability to undertake postgraduate study and suitability for your chosen programme (for example an employer or colleague). We cannot accept references from family members, partners or spouses.\nOnce you have your reference you can either upload via the online application system (if you have not yet submitted your application), via the Gateway if you have already submitted an application, or the reference can be posted to us. You can also send a reference via our enquiry form. If your referee emails your reference to us we can only accept this if it is sent from a university or company email address. Paper reference forms should be endorsed by an appropriate institution/company official stamp. Alternatively we can accept a letter of reference on official institution/company letterhead.\nPlease Note: that it is your responsibility to provide us with any reference that is required, either during the application process or following your receipt of a conditional offer. Postgraduate Admissions will not contact a Referee and make a request on your behalf.\nReferences for Postgraduate applications must be in pdf format, on headed paper, dated, signed/stamped and recommend you for your chosen programme. If your reference is coming direct from your referee, please ensure it comes direct from their institutional or company email address. This can be sent direct to the Admissions team at pg-ad@exeter.ac.uk, along with your student reference number, name and programme of study.\n4.
