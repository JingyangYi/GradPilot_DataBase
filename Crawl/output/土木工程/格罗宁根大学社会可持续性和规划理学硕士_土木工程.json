Our courses pay attention to the\nsocial, cultural, political, and economic environment in which\ndecision-making on spatial interventions takes place.\nThe emergence of self-organizing citizen collectives is a\ncritical change in today's societal strive for sustainable places\nand futures. SSP emphasizes the role of citizens in shaping places.\nWe interrogate why different stakeholders and social groups\nembrace, contest, or reject spatial changes, and how we can design\ntheir surroundings in such a way that it meets their diverse needs.\nWe present spatial justice is a leading principle to design cities\nof the future. Moreover, we pay explicit attention to the ways in\nwhich spatial planning can contribute to achieving the UN’s\nsustainable development goals, such as healthy ageing, a clean\nenvironment, and eliminating poverty, in collaboration with\ncitizens and civil society actors.\nOur programme highlights the social aspects of the global\ntransition towards a more sustainable society. Sustainability\nchallenges are interconnected with the communities that face them.\nAs such, our students learn to adopt new methodological and\ninteractive approaches to problem-solving in different contexts.\nThis exchange does not only take place outside of the classroom,\nbut also within our small-scale, international department.\nYou learn to analyze, develop and negotiate innovative\ninstitutional designs and policy solutions to support and lead\ncomplex transformations in light of international sustainability\nand planning debates. Core of our focus on the human factor in\nsociety, sustainability and planning is using real-life cases and\nworking with and engaging people in real-world living labs.\nThrough this framework, our graduates are able to utilize\nspatial planning in solving urgent social problems, such as\ninequality and climate change. Our alumni are critical and engaged\nconsultants and researchers, who are in high demand on the labour\nmarket. They are employed by NGOs, consultancies, governments, and\nbusinesses.\nIf you are looking for a two year programme and are interested\nin doing research, you can also integrate the master with our two\nyear top rated Research Master in Spatial Sciences.\nMore information can be found at https://www.rug.nl/frw/education/master-info-frw/courses-master-society-sustainability-planning\nAccess with research university, bachelor degree: Human\nGeography and Regional and Urban Planning, Spatial Planning and\nDesign, Urban studies, Land Use Planning and Management, Landscape\nArchitecture, Public Administration and Cultural Geography.

This research agenda focuses on the relationships between\nwellbeing of people (with different identity markers, backgrounds,\nvalues, wishes), institutional innovation (improved governance and\npolicy making), and spatial transformation (changing landscapes,\ncities and regions).\nThe emphasis in Society, Sustainability and Planning related\nresearch lies on the social side of planning.\n‘Ordinary’ people and local communities are often\nneglected by planners and the focus tends to be more dominantly on\npolicy, governance, strategic planning and legal frameworks.\nResearch conducted by researchers active in Socio-Spatial Planning\nprogram aims to understand the ‘HUMAN FACTOR’' in\nspatial planning: why different groups of people embrace, contest\nor reject spatial changes? how do they take the lead in shaping\ntheir own environment and how to align such initiatives with more\nformal plan- and policy-making? how do spatial interventions\ninfluence different stakeholders and their well-being? and how to\nengage society effectively in spatial transformations?\nThe core ambitions of the research that informs the teaching\nprogram of Master SSP are to:\nSome examples of recent research topics of the researchers\nclosely connected to the program of Socio-Spatial Planning\ninclude:\nThe articles written on the above topics by the staff members\nare often used as direct input for lectures and as key literature\nfor the core courses. The Department also facilitates connecting\nMaster thesis research to the ongoing research of staff\nmembers.\nThe motivation why I choose for the masters Society,\nSustainability and Planning (SSP) & Environmental &\nInfrastructure Planning (EIP) was to understand and counteract the,\nin my view, planning and design processes that enforce personal\nexamples of injustice and inequality in the spatial domain. I am\ninterested in giving all actors a voice and the instruments or\ntools to make the physical environment better for its users.\nThe different courses of the masters taught me\ndifferent theoretical and practical lenses of which I am still\ngrateful of and apply in my personal and working life.\nAt the moment I work as a consultant Smart Cities & Smart\nMobility for the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Water\nManagement. What is interesting is that I am most of the time busy\nwith making connections between people and programme’s. I\nbelieve that both masters enabled me to do so because you get to\nknow how the process of spatial planning works and you are aware of\nthe content with in-depth knowledge about sustainability, planning\nand stakeholder involvement. This may seem a bit odd, but in my\nexperience it appears to be a critical power and unique selling\npoint. Most of my colleagues do not have such a background and are\nnot always fully informed about the spatial consequences of their\nactions. A glimpse of programme’s I work on: 5G-Blueprint, a\npublic-private ecosystem for smart and sustainable urban\ndevelopment and the Dutch National Mobility Vision 2050.\nBesides, I started right after my master the company VRX which\nspecialises in using (Immersive) Virtual Reality (IVR) for\nco-creative spatial planning and design. VRX produces virtual\nenvironments where citizens can experience how for instance a\nplayground can look like based on different scenario’s.\nDuring design sessions with IVR we ask them to give their view on\nthe scenario’s so we are able to improve the scenario’s\nwhile working towards a final design.\nThe important thing about both masters is that they provide you\nwith a fruitful and professional knowledge base. After you finish\nyour master you can work in different working fields, for different\norganisations and connect them to each other (energy, water,\ntransport, housing, nature). I hope my personal experience after\nstudy and two years working underlines this and provides an\n(prospective) example for people interested in either or both\nmasters.\n- Roy Boertien\nIn June 2022, I obtained my bachelor degree in Human Geography\nand Planning at the University of Groningen. During my time as a\nbachelor student, I figured out that my interests in Planning are\nwithin the social aspects and how we can make neighborhoods and\ntherefore cities more and more sustainable. Therefore, in September\n2022, I started with the Master's program in Society,\nSustainability and Planning at the University of Groningen, and it\nhas been a thoroughly enjoyable experience since.\nDuring the course of the program, I have had the\nopportunity to study interesting topics such as how to maximize the\nlivability in neighborhoods, how to cope with the urge of cities\nbecoming more sustainable and the opportunity to follow courses\noutside of this master´s program. So far, I can conclude that\nthe program has been well-structured and all courses have been\ncarefully designed to help me gain a comprehensive understanding of\nthe complexities of the matters at hand. From discussions, lectures\nand the projects, I gained insight into the theories and practices\nthat lay under the surface of society, sustainability and planning.\nThe professors at the university are extremely knowledgeable about\nthe subject matter, and their guidance was valuable to develop a\ncomprehensive understanding of all the topics.\nOverall, I am satisfied with my decision to pursue the\nMaster’s program in Society, Sustainability and Planning at\nthe University of Groningen. It has so far been an invaluable\nexperience, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is\nlooking to deepen their knowledge on these topics.\n- Giovanni Kiewiet\nAs an advocate for public transport in a car dependent island,\nmy hometown Puerto Rico, I came to Groningen looking for a degree\nthat would offer a view into a change of planning paradigm. The\nMaster Socio-Spatial Planning has certainly offered me such an\nopportunity, starting with the complexity theory in the Planning\nTheory course and the validation of the sociological knowledge\naddressing the unequal power relations that generate social\ninjustice through the planning practice in City Matters.\nAlso, the study of Dutch planning tradition and\nthe inclusion of civic society in the design of public policies in\nEngaging Society for Spatial Transformation and Revitalizing\nNeighbourhoods courses has been very insightful.\nThe many workshops and excursion to various infrastructure\nprojects in and out of the Netherlands has also been an eye opener\ninto the many possibilities to consider as we create better living\nspaces.\nThis infographic shows in which workfield alumni of the master's\nprogramme ended up, and is based on alumni who graduated between\n2022 and 2024. As is visible, the majority of the alumni have found\na job relevant to their field of study within 6 months since\ngraduating.\nFor any questions about your study planning, choice of study and\npersonal circumstances that influence your study, you can contact\nthe study advisors of the Faculty of Spatial Sciences.

Taking this realization as a starting-point, the Master Socio-Spatial Planning helps you to understand the 'human factor' in spatial planning: why different groups of people embrace, contest or reject spatial changes, how they take the lead in shaping their own environment, how spatial interventions influence different stakeholders and how to engage society effectively in spatial transformations.\n> Master Society, Sustainability and Planning\nThe programme of the master Society, Sustainability and Planning consists of the following courses. Click on the course title to go to the full course description, information about lecturers, literature and time period. The courses in this programme have been scored against the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Find a general overview of how  all of our programmes relate to the SDGs.\nStudents will be asked to reflect on current societal issues which imply spatial planning interventions and are related to contemporary issues such as social innovation, active citizenship, innovative actor-constellations and self-organization in urban development and planning. This course enables students to build their own framework to develop and conduct theory-informed empirical research in new socio-geographical contexts and to propose ‘just’ planning interventions.\nRelated SDG: 1 no poverty, 3 good health and well-being, 10 reduced inequalities, 11 sustainable cities and communities, 16 peace, justice and strong institutions\nThe course aims to introduce students to key theories on the complex interaction between people, space and decision-makers. This course shows that spatial change in neighbourhoods must be understood as deeply social processes, with social causes and effects. The neighbourhood is the foundation for a community with social ties – a home stead for groups of people. That makes issues in neighbourhoods charged with intersubjective and emotional meaning, and a demographical origin.\nRelated SDG: 2 zero hunger, 3 good health and well-being, 10 reduced inequalities, 11 sustainable cities and communities, 12 responsible consumption and production\nThe aim of the planning theory course is to gain more in-depth knowledge of the theoretical background of planning in such a way that you can identify suitable existing planning and decision-making models for issues at hand.\nWe see the emergence of citizens and entrepreneurs who collectively take the lead in spatial transformation in the c0ntext of place-based development. Examples are initiatives in revitalizing of public space, self-governance in energy production, food, health-care, or landscape maintenance, or fostering social cohesion in neighborhoods and other meaningful everyday places. The course provides insight to understand these forms of self-governance from different perspectives.\nRelated SDG: 11 sustainable cities and communities, 13 climate action\nThe city is constantly in transition. This is to say that demands, tensions and opportunities are continuously changing, which lead to new societal challenges for policy makers. In the Revitalising Neighbourhoods course, youexplore the ‘state of the art’ of these societal challenges in neighbourhoods and reflect on urban renewal policies.\nRelated SDG: 3 good health and well-being, 10 reduced inequalities, 11 sustainable cities and communities\nStudents analyse spatial challenges and ambitions of a real-life case in order to formulate provocative yet viable and credible policy advice. Socio-spatial data, policy documents, interaction with the actual stakeholders, and location feed into your analysis. Students resulting policy advice presents the client with an appealing and authentic vision of its future and needs to show how to transform the location under investigation into a more sustainable place (people, planet, profit).\nYou can find an overview of the electives for Socioty, Sustainability and Planning in the course catalogue Ocasys.\nThe Master thesis involves an individual research project on issues relevant to socio-spatial planning. The aim of the project is to gain practical and comprehensive experience in doing scientific research.\n[HTML_TABLE]\nLaatst gewijzigd: | 21 september 2023 15:05\n[CARD]\nCourses master Society, Sustainability and Planning\n[CARD]\nFunctional\nFunctional\n\n                                Provides basic functions and uses anonymized cookies.\n[CARD]\nFunctional\nProvides basic functions and uses anonymized cookies.\n[CARD]\nFunctional\n[CARD]\nProvides basic functions and uses anonymized cookies.\n[CARD]\nStandard\nStandard\n\n                                Provides optimal operation and uses video cookies, among others.\n[CARD]\nStandard\nProvides optimal operation and uses video cookies, among others.\n[CARD]\nStandard\n[CARD]\nProvides optimal operation and uses video cookies, among others.\n[CARD]\nComplete\nComplete\n\n                                Provides personalized content and uses marketing cookies.\n[CARD]\nComplete\nProvides personalized content and uses marketing cookies.\n[CARD]\nComplete\n[CARD]\nProvides personalized content and uses marketing cookies.",

This programme allows the study of Spatial Sciences in\nthe broadest possible way and it trains students to become good\nresearchers.\nThe two-year Research Master in Spatial Sciences has two key\nfeatures. First, it allows students maximum scientific freedom to\nlearn and discover. Second, it lets students develop serious\nscientific research skills. Throughout the programme we take\ninspiration from Einstein's words: 'I have no special talents. I am\nonly passionately curious'. Research Master students don't have to\nbe extraordinarily talented or gifted. But students need to have a\npassionate curiosity about people and places. With this driving\ncuriosity the research master Spatial Sciences is a good\nchoice.\nMaximum scientific freedom to learn and\ndiscover\n\nStudents can design their own programme by choosing courses\naccording to their own interests. They can choose courses from all\nSpatial Sciences master programmes: environmental and\ninfrastructure planning, economic geography, population studies,\nsocio-spatial planning, or real estate studies and they may also\ninclude courses from other faculties.\nSerious development of research skills\n\nStudents become a good researcher by experiencing a series of\ncarefully designed research settings. They will participate in a\njoint multidisciplinary research challenge with other ReMa\nstudents. They will receive one-to-one individual research training\nfrom an URSI staff member involved in the tWIST research programme\nof our faculty. They will do a research internship at an\noutstanding research institute. The research experiences will be\nboth big and small: they will range from the final master thesis\ntaking several months to small half an hour researches as part of\nthe scientific diary. Students will be trained in a wide array of\nresearch methods.\nTrack\n\nIf you want to combine thorough training in scientific research\nwith a thematic specialization on islands and sustainability, we\noffer a track in Islands and Sustainability\nSpecializations\n\nThe Research Master offers a specialization option. Students\ncombine the courses of a one-year FSS master within the two-year\nResearch Master programme. They receive a formal specialization on\ntheir diploma supplement. Check all of our master's\nprogrammes to find your specialization.\nFor a top level education in geography and planning you choose\nGroningen!\nFor more information about the courses in this programme, please\nvisit https://www.rug.nl/frw/education/master-info-frw/courses-master-spatial-sciences\nIt is also possible to do the course Research Internship at a\nResearch Institute (RIRI) for 15 EC, where you replace a 5 EC part\nof Thematic Theoretical Specialization for 5 EC extra RIRI.\nStudents should have a Bachelor's degree in a discipline related\nto Regional Studies, such as Human Geography and Planning,\nEnvironment and Infrastructure Planning, or Urban Studies.

Its relevance is in addressing\nspatial aspects of the key societal challenges and emerging\ntechnological transitions of today.\nOur research programme is titled TRACE (TRAnsformations, Communities\nand Environments). Our ambition is to create scientific and\nsocietal impact by undertaking cutting-edge research at the\ninterface of people, places, and planning in rural and urban\nsettings, especially at local and regional scales, in the\nNetherlands, Europe and globally.\nThe Study Programme consists of different courses in the field\nof Spatial Sciences, related to the topics in TRACE. The specific\ncourses depend on the individual student’s interests.\nStudents have the opportunity to develop their own educational\npathway according to their preferences and motivations.\nTop researchers\nThe researchers who participate in the programme are actively\nworking on international and national research projects and bring\ntheir experiences to their teaching. For example:\nStudying the Research Master in Spatial Sciences at Groningen\nUniversity has been motivational. The research master is a two-year\nprogramme enabling you to deepen your knowledge of courses and\nmethodologies. In my case it has allowed me the time and the space\nto reflect on my interest within human geography and put this into\npractice through my research.\nThe standard of teaching at the Faculty of Spatial\nSciences is very high with staff who are understanding and\nprofessional. Having studied in Scotland for my bachelor, adjusting\nto a new education system had some challenges. I felt however that\nthe programme accommodated international students and their\ntransition to a new education system.\nOne of the highlights of this course was the opportunity to do\nan internship. I undertook this internship in Brussels with a\nresearch institute specialising in urban mobility. The internship\nwas a great experience in improving my collaboration skills with\nother researchers, while pushing me out of my comfort zone\nacademically. Working in the capital city of Europe allowed me to\nexplore the complexity and intersectional nature of urban\nmobility.\nThis master has encouraged me to pursue a career in mobility,\nand I am excited to start my thesis centered around this topic.\n- Sorcha Macintyre\nThis infographic shows in which workfield alumni of the master's\nprogramme ended up, and is based on alumni who graduated between\n2022 and 2024. As is visible, the majority of the alumni have found\na job relevant to their field of study within 6 months since\ngraduating.\nFor any questions about your study planning, choice of study and\npersonal circumstances that influence your study, you can contact\nthe study advisors of the Faculty of Spatial Sciences.
