Will admission into the program guarantee me some form of funding?\n[HEADING] Q. Is the GRE required?\n[HEADING] Q. Can I receive an application fee waiver?\n[HEADING] Q. How long should my Statement of Purpose be and what should be included?\n[HEADING] Q. Do I need to specify my committee chair or select a faculty member as part of the application?\n[HEADING] Q. What's the difference between a Master of Science and a Master of Engineering?\n[HEADING] Q. Can I go straight into the Ph.D. program directly from a bachelor's degree?\nTo be eligible for all teaching assistantships, research assistantships and fellowships, you must apply by December 15 for admission the following fall semester. Applications for the fall semester not seeking financial aid will continue to be accepted until April 15 for international applicants, and until July 15 for applicants who are U.S. residents or permanent residents. To be considered for all teaching assistantships, research assistantships and fellowships you must apply by June 1 for admission the following spring semester.\nNo. Admission and funding are separate issues. Students must be admitted to be considered for funding. But once admitted, students are automatically considered for all funding opportunities available.  There is no separate application necessary.\nThe Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) are no longer required. The English Language Proficiency requirement has not been waived for Fall 2022, and you must submit the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or International English Language Testing System (IELTS) scores. More information about requirements can be found here.\nUnfortunately, no. The application fee is set by EngineeringCAS and Texas A&M University.\nThe Statement of Purpose is your opportunity to tell the department why you are a good fit for the program and why the program is a good fit for you. Tell us about you, who you are and why you’d like to pursue this.  Talk about your professional plans and goals for the future and how pursuing this degree will help you achieve them. Remember that the admission committees review hundreds of applications every term, so try to keep your Statement of Purpose to no more than two pages unless there are factors and circumstances which would merit a longer explanation.\nNo. Students will be assigned an initial advisor once admitted but are free to change that after beginning their studies. Graduate chair committees will not be determined until a degree plan is filed. You will not have to decide who will chair your committee until you file a degree plan. Depending on the degree, students usually have at least two semesters to decide. This allows ample time to get to know professors and vice versa.\nThere are three different types of master's degrees: Master of Engineering (M.Eng); and Master of Science (M.S.) thesis or non-thesis options. The M.S. thesis includes research, while the M.Eng and M.S. non-thesis are not research degrees, all coursework. All three options require 30 completed semester credit hours (SCH).\nYes. You can apply directly to the Ph.D. program from your undergraduate degree without completing a master's degree. The degree will take longer, but it can be done. If you are denied admission into the Ph.D. program, your application will still be considered for the master's program.",
