My scholarship really drove me to do my best in all my subjects as well as to get the most out of uni life, hence all the clubs I joined where I met so many great people.\nExplorer Award\nGet as involved as possible! It is so easy to get caught up with study and just focus on your subjects, however, there are so many incredible opportunities available at UNSW which really develop you as a person.\nMagnitude Foundation Scholarship\nNew Colombo Plan Ambassador\nHaving grown up in Singapore, Australia, India and Indonesia, it was imperative that the university I chose to spend the next four years at, would continue to stimulate my global awareness and international exposure. Not only that, but as one of few young, driven women in a male-dominated field, I needed to know that I will be given equal opportunities and possibilities.\nTidswell Family Women in Engineering Scholarship\nDoing my Honours degree in ecology at UNSW provided me the opportunity to work with world class scientists to help save some of the most threatened species in Australia. Throughout my undergraduate, I have been taught to become more than just a researcher but also a communicator and educator at UNSW.\nSonja Huddle Award\nI elected to study Electrical Engineering for several reasons. Foremost was my strength in maths, physic and electrotechnology in high school, particularly in the electrical components of the latter two courses. I enjoyed these components so much that I asked my physics teacher to let me use the labs during breaks and after school - I'd bring in old TVs and microwaves, take them apart and use their parts in electrical circuits.\nFaculty of Engineering Rural Scholarship\nDepartment of Education and Training/UNSW Rural Assistance Scheme\nBeing able to hold a Ben Lexcen sporting scholarship has really helped my academic and sporting life. The access to the gym and pool on campus, as well as the support from the scholarship staff and UNSW sport clubs has really advanced my ability to train and balance my time.\nBen Lexcen Sports Scholarship\nThe support that scholarships offer in terms of helping students with the cost of their degrees and living expenses in Sydney is remarkable. Obviously it is nice for your personal efforts to be recognised\nAlumni Association Scholarship\nSam Cracknell Memorial Sports Scholarship\nI chose UNSW because of the inclusive atmosphere and because I felt it was really at the forefront of academics, research and innovation. I wanted a university that was looking to the future and presenting its students with exciting\nScientia Scholarship\nAcademic Achievement Awards (AAA)\nI am fortunate enough to study medicine. One aspect of medicine that appealed to me is that medicine presents the opportunity to positively contribute to the health and wellbeing of those around me. Also appealing to me was, the notion that medicine, by nature, is a dynamic degree, constantly evolving with advancements in knowledge every year.\nBalnaves Foundation Indigenous Medical Scholarship\nHaving a scholarship gave me the funds to be able to move into a college on campus! This has cut down my travel time by 3 hours, allowing me to get more work in and be more active in UNSW societies.\nDSTO Undergraduate Scholarship for Females in Science and Engineering\nHonourable Jack Beale Scholarship in Engineering\nMy other piece of advice is to remember that, on a philosophical level, success cannot exist without failure. When you make mistakes, and it is inevitable that you will, I’d really recommend that you reflect on them and to think about what you could do better next time.\nNew Colombo Plan Scholarship\nIslamic Society Scholarship\nAll-Rounder Scholarship\nAlumni Association Scholarship\nConnect with us\n• Home\n• About\n• Search & Apply\n• FAQs\n• Profiles\n• News\n• Contact us\n• Starting undergraduate study in Term 1 2026?\n \nMore information here\n• UNSW Equity Scholarships\n \nMore information here\n• UNSW Gateway Advantage Award & UNSW Gateway Award\nMore information here\n• Undergrad & Postgrad Coursework Scholarships\nScholarships for local and international students, including high school leavers, other future students and current UNSW students.\n• More information here\n• Postgraduate Research Scholarships\nContact the Graduate Research School\nMore information here\n• Search for scholarships\n• Register & login\n• Apply & complete your application\n• Submit online by the due date\n• To anyone that wants to pursue sport at an elite level whilst continuing their studies I can't recommend UNSW highly enough, it has far exceeded my expectations in the support and flexibility provided to Athletes whilst also providing an excellent academic program.\n\n\n\n \n Jack Adams \n Ben Lexcen Sports Scholarship\n• Receiving a scholarship was such a privilege and I really wanted to make the most of this opportunity.

I enjoyed these components so much that I asked my physics teacher to let me use the labs during breaks and after school - I'd bring in old TVs and microwaves, take them apart and use their parts in electrical circuits. \n\n\n\n \n Clarence  Harré  \n Faculty of Engineering Rural Scholarship\nDepartment of Education and Training/UNSW Rural Assistance Scheme\n• Being able to hold a Ben Lexcen sporting scholarship has really helped my academic and sporting life. The access to the gym and pool on campus, as well as the support from the scholarship staff and UNSW sport clubs has really advanced my ability to train and balance my time.\n\n\n\n \n Bryce Collins \n Ben Lexcen Sports Scholarship\n• The support that scholarships offer in terms of helping students with the cost of their degrees and living expenses in Sydney is remarkable. Obviously it is nice for your personal efforts to be recognised\n\n\n\n \n David  Abi-Hanna \n Alumni Association Scholarship\nSam Cracknell Memorial Sports Scholarship\n• I chose UNSW because of the inclusive atmosphere and because I felt it was really at the forefront of academics, research and innovation. I wanted a university that was looking to the future and presenting its students with exciting \n\n\n\n \n Nechama  Basserabie \n Scientia Scholarship\nAcademic Achievement Awards (AAA)\n• I am fortunate enough to study medicine. One aspect of medicine that appealed to me is that medicine presents the opportunity to positively contribute to the health and wellbeing of those around me. Also appealing to me was, the notion that medicine, by nature, is a dynamic degree, constantly evolving with advancements in knowledge every year. \n\n\n\n \n Benjamin  Jones \n Balnaves Foundation Indigenous Medical Scholarship\n• Having a scholarship gave me the funds to be able to move into a college on campus! This has cut down my travel time by 3 hours, allowing me to get more work in and be more active in UNSW societies.\n\n\n\n \n Jacqueline  Orme \n DSTO Undergraduate Scholarship for Females in Science and Engineering\nHonourable Jack Beale Scholarship in Engineering\n• My other piece of advice is to remember that, on a philosophical level, success cannot exist without failure. When you make mistakes, and it is inevitable that you will, I’d really recommend that you reflect on them and to think about what you could do better next time.\n\n\n\n \n James  Dunn \n New Colombo Plan Scholarship\nIslamic Society Scholarship\nAll-Rounder Scholarship \nAlumni Association Scholarship",

CSPs are available for a variety of postgraduate programs, spanning across all UNSW faculties. You could cultivate your thinking and get practical, hands-on skills for tomorrow’s workforce at UNSW – all at a reduced cost.\nWe're here to guide you through the application process and answer all of your questions about studying at UNSW.\nApply now to further your education journey, future-proof your skills and expand your career opportunities.\nA Commonwealth Supported Place is a spot at a university or higher education provider that's subsidised by the Australian Government. If you studied an undergraduate degree as a domestic student, chances are that you had one of these places. Although less common for postgraduate degrees, they’re just one of many assistance schemes offered to help you on your way to further study.\nYou’re eligible if you:\nStudents who receive a CSP don’t pay full course fees. Rather, the Australian Government pays one part and you pay the smaller ‘student contribution’ fee. This can make postgraduate study more affordable. If you choose to defer the remaining part through HECS-HELP, you may not have any upfront course fees.\nCSPs are competitive as there are limited places available. You won’t need to submit a separate application as all domestic applicants will be considered when applying for a CSP available degree through Apply Online. If you’re applying through UAC, you will need to list both the CSP and full-fee degree codes to be considered.\nThe following links can help you determine if your desired degree has CSP availability and whether you will need to apply via UAC. If you do need to apply via UAC, please do so as soon as you are able, as this application system is time sensitive.\nInvesting in yourself by pursuing a postgraduate degree can help you follow your passion or discover a new one. Postgraduate study can accelerate your career by bringing new skills, networks and more income. Furthering your studies will be a challenge, but the value is clear. Within three years of graduating, UNSW graduates earn the highest median salaries among graduates from the Group of Eight universities (QILT Graduate Outcomes Survey, medium-term - three years after graduating, 2023). Gaining a postgraduate qualification can increase your income considerably, with the Australian median salary of $85,300 for graduates with postgraduate qualifications, compared to $62,600 for bachelor degree graduates.\nIf your degree doesn’t offer CSPs or if you don’t receive an offer for a CSP, there are other schemes available to support you. Government-supported schemes such as FEE-HELP allow eligible domestic fee-paying students to defer part or all their tuition fees. Centrelink also has several allowance schemes available to help eligible students pay for living costs.\nUNSW scholarships also support thousands of students each year to make their goals of achieving further education more attainable. Find out what scholarships you might be eligible for and make sure you check the application deadline.\nApplicants who have been successful in obtaining a Commonwealth Supported Place will have this reflected onin their UNSW offer letter.\nIf you have applied directly to UNSW via Apply Online, we are issuing CSP offers every 3 weeks following this schedule:\nIf you have received a full fee-paying offer, you may still be eligible for a Commonwealth Supported Place in another round closer to the start of term. To ensure you do not miss out, we encourage you to accept your existing offer, which will be updated and re-issued if you are deemed eligible for a CSP nearer to the commencement of term.\nIf you have accepted a full fee-paying position at UNSW Sydney and are offered a Commonwealth Supported Place later, the subsidised offer will supersede your fee-paying position, once accepted.\nWe are currently issuing CSP offers for Term 3 on UAC’s offer round schedule for Postgraduate courses. If you have not received an offer for a CSP in this round, it is unlikely we would be able to issue you a CSP offer for Term 3 2025. To be considered for a Commonwealth Supported Place, you can update your preferences for Term 1 2026 entry, but it is important to note that this will incur a further UAC Application fee.\nWe are not currently issuing CSP offers for Term 1 2026 but expect to make a limited number of CSP offers beginning in November to eligible applicants.\nApplied via Apply Online: If you hold a CSP offer but do not accept it by the deadline, please contact UNSW Admissions to have your application reassessed in the final offer round. If places available and successful, a new CSP offer will be issued; otherwise, a full-fee paying offer will be provided.\nApplied via UAC: If you hold a CSP offer but do not accept it by the deadline, we are not able to re-issue you with a CSP offer for the same term. Hence, you will need to preference a full fee-paying place for the same term, or reapply to be considered in Term 1 2026, noting this will involve a further application fee.\nCurrent UNSW undergraduate students applying for postgraduate programs will be considered equally with all other applicants. Offers will be made in later rounds once UNSW results are released.\nCSP offers may be deferred for up to one year, in line with UNSW’s approved deferral policy. Eligible deferral requests will be processed as CSP deferrals into 2026.\nView our available postgraduate programs that have Commonwealth Supported Places (CSP).\nSign up to our newsletter - we'll keep you updated on degree information, scholarships and upcoming events.\nIf you have any questions about studying at UNSW or how you can make your studies work for you, contact us below.

Government-supported schemes such as FEE-HELP allow eligible domestic fee-paying students to defer part or all their tuition fees. Centrelink also has several allowance schemes available to help eligible students pay for living costs.\nUNSW scholarships also support thousands of students each year to make their goals of achieving further education more attainable. Find out what scholarships you might be eligible for and make sure you check the application deadline.\nFrequently asked questions\nHow will I know if I am successful in obtaining a Commonwealth Supported Place? \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplicants who have been successful in obtaining a Commonwealth Supported Place will have this reflected onin their UNSW offer letter. \nIf you have applied directly to UNSW via Apply Online, we are issuing CSP offers every 3 weeks following this schedule:\nT3 2025\n\nRound \nOffers issued\nOffer expires\n1\nTuesday 10 June\nTuesday 24 June\n2\nTuesday 1 July\nTuesday 15 July\n3\nTuesday 22 July\nTuesday 5 August\n4\nTuesday 12 August\nTuesday 26 August\nFinal\nTuesday 2 September\nSunday 14 September\n\n \nIf you have received a full fee-paying offer, you may still be eligible for a Commonwealth Supported Place in another round closer to the start of term.

We’re here to help.\n[GRID_TABLE]\nHow to apply\n                    \n\n                        We're here to guide you through the application process and answer all of your questions about studying at UNSW.\nApply now\n                    \n\n                        Apply now to further your education journey, future-proof your skills and expand your career opportunities.\n[GRID_TABLE]\nWhat is a Commonwealth Supported Place (CSP)?\nA Commonwealth Supported Place is a spot at a university or higher education provider that's subsidised by the Australian Government. If you studied an undergraduate degree as a domestic student, chances are that you had one of these places. Although less common for postgraduate degrees, they’re just one of many assistance schemes offered to help you on your way to further study.\nYou’re eligible if you:\n\nare an Australian or New Zealand citizen\nhold an Australian permanent residency visa\nhold an Australian permanent humanitarian visa\n\nStudents who receive a CSP don’t pay full course fees. Rather, the Australian Government pays one part and you pay the smaller ‘student contribution’ fee. This can make postgraduate study more affordable. If you choose to defer the remaining part through HECS-HELP, you may not have any upfront course fees.\nCSPs are competitive as there are limited places available. You won’t need to submit a separate application as all domestic applicants will be considered when applying for a CSP available degree through Apply Online. If you’re applying through UAC, you will need to list both the CSP and full-fee degree codes to be considered.\nThe following links can help you determine if your desired degree has CSP availability and whether you will need to apply via UAC. If you do need to apply via UAC, please do so as soon as you are able, as this application system is time sensitive.\nWhat does it mean for me?\nReceive a government subsidy for postgrad study, and reduce your education costs. You may also be able to defer upfront fees through HECS-HELP. \nQuickly enhance your qualifications (in as little as six to eight months) \nUpdate your knowledge, increase your employment opportunities to transition into a new field \nReduce the time it takes to complete a Master’s degree or further study.\nIs the investment worth it?\nInvesting in yourself by pursuing a postgraduate degree can help you follow your passion or discover a new one. Postgraduate study can accelerate your career by bringing new skills, networks and more income. Furthering your studies will be a challenge, but the value is clear. Within three years of graduating, UNSW graduates earn the highest median salaries among graduates from the Group of Eight universities (QILT Graduate Outcomes Survey, medium-term - three years after graduating, 2023). Gaining a postgraduate qualification can increase your income considerably, with the Australian median salary of $85,300 for graduates with postgraduate qualifications, compared to $62,600 for bachelor degree graduates.\nWhat other options are available?\nIf your degree doesn’t offer CSPs or if you don’t receive an offer for a CSP, there are other schemes available to support you. Government-supported schemes such as FEE-HELP allow eligible domestic fee-paying students to defer part or all their tuition fees. Centrelink also has several allowance schemes available to help eligible students pay for living costs.\nUNSW scholarships also support thousands of students each year to make their goals of achieving further education more attainable.

As a result, we expect that there may be longer visa processing times for students submitting visa applications to study at UNSW Sydney.\nTo avoid delays on your study plan, we encourage you to submit your visa application to the Australian Government as soon as you receive a Confirmation of Enrolment (COE) from us.\nFor more information about applying for an Australian Student Visa, please visit this page.\nUNSW will be making offers to eligible postgraduate programs on the basis of six out of eight or seven out of eight semesters studied. Students will need a weighted average mark (WAM) of 5 points above the advertised level to be eligible with 6/8 semesters studied, or a weighted average mark (WAM) of 2 points above the advertised level to be eligible with 7/8 or 5/6 semesters studied.\nApplicants who do not meet this rank will be placed on hold and may be made an offer once they upload their final results.\nWe have altered our policy around predicted grades to widen the qualifications that we accept and have improved the process of assessment. UNSW now accepts predicted grades for full offers for the following qualifications:\nStudents who are completing an approved external English language program can request an extension of their offer deadline until their course is finished.\nForecast results must be presented in the following format:\nStudents who meet program entry requirements based on their SAT, AP, or ACT results are now eligible to receive a full or conditional on English offer ahead of their final high school result and proof of and completion of high school studies. Results and proof of high school completion will be required no later than the UNSW term commencement date and must be submitted as soon as they become available. This change aims to support students in lodging timely visa applications and re-establishes opportunity to commence their undergraduate studies as planned.\nIn addition to sharing SAT/AP/ACT results with UNSW via the College Board portal, students must submit a letter from their school meeting the following minimum criteria:\nThis assessment policy is only available for students completing Year 12 high school qualifications recognised by UNSW for direct entry. It excludes:\nIf an application is incomplete by the final submission date for that term, it will not meet the requirements and will not be eligible for an offer, resulting in a denial.\nTo be eligible for consideration in a grouped offer round, applicants must meet the minimum entry requirements for the program as listed on the degree page for the program noting that these requirements are a guide only and do not guarantee an offer will be made.\nUpon assessment within each offer round, applicants will fall into one of three categories:\nUNSW is unable to provide estimated grouped offer round admissions cut-offs as these will be based on the quality of applicants within each offer round. Once the initial three rounds of grouped offers are complete for a program, we will publish indicative scores (including average and lowest scores for receiving an offer) on the relevant program’s degree page on the UNSW website.\nThe number of offers made during each round will be determined by program capacity. UNSW is unable to share this information with applicants.\nUNSW reserves the right to make ad-hoc offers to exceptional applicants outside of the grouped offer rounds. We will also continue to make offers via UAC for relevant students, with entry ranks reflecting grouped offer round cut-offs.\nIf you need to complete a 10-week or 15-week University English Entry Course (UEEC) offered by UNSW College and are looking to study one of the high-demand programs in 2026, please submit your complete application by the grouped round 1 application deadline of each term for your best opportunity to commence your study in that term.\nIf you require an English package and would like to defer, you will need to request a deferred offer from UNSW. Once you have the deferred offer, it should be provided to UNSW College Admissions, who can issue an updated offer for your English course. Please note, deferral requests are not guaranteed to be approved.\nUNSW expects to make a number of offers through UAC for International Students. The majority of these offers will be made in the UAC December Round 2 offer round for 2026 intake.\nUNSW will release conditional offers based on English language results during regular offer rounds. These offers will include an expiry deadline by which students must meet the conditions - either by submitting their English test results or enrolling in UNSW College’s UEEC program.\nStudents who are completing an approved external English language program can request an extension of their offer expiry deadline until their course is finished.\nStudents seeking to defer their offer to study at UNSW (before accepting) may submit an offer deferral request via the following channels:\nPlease note that offer deferral is not guaranteed and requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Where permitted, offers will only be able to be deferred for a period of up to one year.\nYou can find more about deferment and deferral here.\nMost UNSW international offer holders will have a personalised offer expiry date to accept, decline or defer their study at UNSW. The offer expiry will be active from the date that you receive your offer and your offer will lapse after the offer expiry date.\nOffer holders will have until 11:59 pm (AEDT) to accept their offer on the acceptance deadline date.\nThe following cohorts will not have an offer expiry:\nUAC International Offer Holders will also receive a personalised offer expiry and must accept within this period.\nConditional offer holders will have an offer expiry date that conditions must be met by in order to be issued a full, unconditional offer. Please note these full offers will also have an additional offer expiry date.\nFull offer holders\nFull offer holders will now have 21 days to accept their offer before it expires.\nConditional offer holders\nConditional offer holders will have 8 weeks (56 days) to meet the conditions of their offer, either by submitting English language results or confirming their enrolment in UNSW College’s UEEC program and accept their offer. Students who are completing an approved external English language program can request an extension of their offer expiry deadline until their course is finished.\nOnce the conditions are met and offer is accepted, students will receive a full offer, which will include our standard 21-day period to accept the offer.\nYou can see your offer expiry date on your offer letter and on UNSW Accept Online.\nYou will need to reapply to study at UNSW.\nUNSW will only approve for an extension on an offer under special circumstances. This also applies for UAC International students who have missed the deadline.\nThe below reasons are not accepted as reasons for extension of an offer:\nIf you have an extenuating circumstance, please contact your agent or UNSW regional representative.\nUNSW will only approve for an extension on an offer under extreme special circumstances. This also applies for UAC International students who have missed the deadline.\nYou will not receive another offer letter, however you can see the revised expiry date on UNSW Accept Online.\nMost UNSW offer holders will have a set time period to accept, decline or defer their study at UNSW. The personalised offer expiry is specified in the offer letter and UNSW Accept Online.\nIf you are in one of the following cohorts, you will not have a personalised offer expiry:\nUNSW will move to a new academic calendar in 2028.\nAs a global top 20 university and ranked number one in Australia for employment outcomes (2025 QS World University Rankings), this new academic calendar is designed to meet the changing needs of the broader educational landscape and follows extensive feedback from students, staff and the community over the past 18 months.\nThe new ‘flex-semester’ calendar is a semester structure for our undergraduate students and the majority of postgraduate students, centring on delivering the best learning experiences and outcomes for all our students throughout their lifelong education journey.\nFor further information on the new calendar and FAQs please visit our website.\nIf you can’t find the answer you’re looking for below, our Future Student Advisers are here to help.\nSign up to our newsletter - we'll keep you updated on degree information, scholarships and upcoming events.\n• Search\n• LinkedIn\n• Facebook\n• Instagram\n• TikTok\n• YouTube\n• Applications are prioritised according to academic merit and subject to program availability.\n• Issued offers will have a specified acceptance period.\n• Offer deferrals will no longer be automatically approved.\n• Change of program requests will only be considered with a new application.\n• Grouped offer rounds are used for high-demand programs.

apply to UNSW with incomplete academic results? \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUNSW will be making offers to eligible postgraduate programs on the basis of six out of eight or seven out of eight semesters studied. Students will need a weighted average mark (WAM) of 5 points above the advertised level to be eligible with 6/8 semesters studied, or a weighted average mark (WAM) of 2 points above the advertised level to be eligible with 7/8 or 5/6 semesters studied.\nApplicants who do not meet this rank will be placed on hold and may be made an offer once they upload their final results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Will UNSW accept predicted grades for full undergraduate offers?\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have altered our policy around predicted grades to widen the qualifications that we accept and have improved the process of assessment.

Students will need a weighted average mark (WAM) of 5 points above the advertised level to be eligible with 6/8 semesters studied, or a weighted average mark (WAM) of 2 points above the advertised level to be eligible with 7/8 or 5/6 semesters studied.\nApplicants who do not meet this rank will be placed on hold and may be made an offer once they upload their final results.\n• Will UNSW accept predicted grades for full undergraduate offers?\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have altered our policy around predicted grades to widen the qualifications that we accept and have improved the process of assessment. UNSW now accepts predicted grades for full offers for the following qualifications:\n\nInternational Baccalaureate (IB)\nA-Levels\nIndian CBSE\nSingapore A-levels\nNCUK\nSouth African NSC\n\nStudents who are completing an approved external English language program can request an extension of their offer deadline until their course is finished.\nKey considerations:\n\nA buffer of 2 points above the standard entry requirement is required for a full offer based on predicted grades.

Results and proof of high school completion will be required no later than the UNSW term commencement date and must be submitted as soon as they become available. This change aims to support students in lodging timely visa applications and re-establishes opportunity to commence their undergraduate studies as planned.\nAdditional requirement – enrolment or expected graduation letter\nIn addition to sharing SAT/AP/ACT results with UNSW via the College Board portal, students must submit a letter from their school meeting the following minimum criteria:\n\nprinted on official school letterhead\nbears the official seal of the school\nincludes the student’s full name and date of birth\nspecifies the current stage of study (e.g., Year 11/12)\nstates the expected graduation date\nspecifies the name of the final award or test (e.g., US High School Diploma, Chinese High School Graduation Certificate, Indonesian SMA Certificate)\n\nEligibility\nThis assessment policy is only available for students completing Year 12 high school qualifications recognised by UNSW for direct entry.

These offers will continue to be released on a rolling basis.  \nExisting conditional offers (English and GTE) remain valid, and we encourage these offer holders to meet the conditions of their offer as soon as possible.    \nExisting UNSW College students with a packaged offer to study in Term 3 2025 at UNSW remain unaffected.   \nAny 2025 applicants who fall outside the prioritised categories will now be assessed for the next available 2026 intake. Offers for eligible students will be released from Thursday, 26 June.  \nDeferments are only available for 2026 intakes \nLate acceptance extension requests will no longer be approved and we encourage students to accept their offer on time.  \nStudy abroad and non-award students are not impacted and processes and deadlines remain the same.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2026 Applications\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplications for general programs\nApplications for 2026 are open.

As a result, we expect that there may be longer visa processing times for students submitting visa applications to study at UNSW Sydney.  \nTo avoid delays on your study plan, we encourage you to submit your visa application to the Australian Government as soon as you receive a Confirmation of Enrolment (COE) from us.\nFor more information about applying for an Australian Student Visa, please visit this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAQs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Apply to UNSW\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Can I apply to UNSW with incomplete academic results? \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUNSW will be making offers to eligible postgraduate programs on the basis of six out of eight or seven out of eight semesters studied. Students will need a weighted average mark (WAM) of 5 points above the advertised level to be eligible with 6/8 semesters studied, or a weighted average mark (WAM) of 2 points above the advertised level to be eligible with 7/8 or 5/6 semesters studied.\nApplicants who do not meet this rank will be placed on hold and may be made an offer once they upload their final results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Will UNSW accept predicted grades for full undergraduate offers?\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have altered our policy around predicted grades to widen the qualifications that we accept and have improved the process of assessment. UNSW now accepts predicted grades for full offers for the following qualifications:\n\nInternational Baccalaureate (IB)\nA-Levels\nIndian CBSE\nSingapore A-levels\nNCUK\nSouth African NSC\n\nStudents who are completing an approved external English language program can request an extension of their offer deadline until their course is finished.\nKey considerations:\n\nA buffer of 2 points above the standard entry requirement is required for a full offer based on predicted grades. Offers will only be issued where this is met or exceeded and all other requirements have been met.\nStudents must provide final results when available, and no later than the UNSW term commencement date.\nIf final results do not meet program entry requirements, students may need to:\ntransfer to a program with lower requirements, or\nexplore pathway options such as UNSW College Diplomas, or\nseek study alternatives outside UNSW\n\n\n\nRequired documentation:\nForecast results must be presented in the following format:\n\nBe printed on official school letterhead and include the institution stamp and signature of the Principal, Registrar or Academic Director.\nBe dated after 1 May for Term 1 (February intake) and 1 November of the previous year for Term 3 (September intake).\nFor IB Forecast only: IB Forecast results have the total predicted score as well as the individual scores for each subject.\nThe total predicted aggregate must be the equivalent of 2 points higher than the total final aggregate required for admission.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                What are the eligibility criteria and additional requirements for UNSW applicants holding SAT, AP, or ACT results?\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents who meet program entry requirements based on their SAT, AP, or ACT results are now eligible to receive a full or conditional on English offer ahead of their final high school result and proof of and completion of high school studies. Results and proof of high school completion will be required no later than the UNSW term commencement date and must be submitted as soon as they become available. This change aims to support students in lodging timely visa applications and re-establishes opportunity to commence their undergraduate studies as planned.\nAdditional requirement – enrolment or expected graduation letter\nIn addition to sharing SAT/AP/ACT results with UNSW via the College Board portal, students must submit a letter from their school meeting the following minimum criteria:\n\nprinted on official school letterhead\nbears the official seal of the school\nincludes the student’s full name and date of birth\nspecifies the current stage of study (e.g., Year 11/12)\nstates the expected graduation date\nspecifies the name of the final award or test (e.g., US High School Diploma, Chinese High School Graduation Certificate, Indonesian SMA Certificate)\n\nEligibility\nThis assessment policy is only available for students completing Year 12 high school qualifications recognised by UNSW for direct entry.
