Its relevance is in addressing\nspatial aspects of the key societal challenges and emerging\ntechnological transitions of today.\nOur research programme is titled TRACE (TRAnsformations, Communities\nand Environments). Our ambition is to create scientific and\nsocietal impact by undertaking cutting-edge research at the\ninterface of people, places, and planning in rural and urban\nsettings, especially at local and regional scales, in the\nNetherlands, Europe and globally.\nExamples of research projects related to EIP\n‘Playing with Urban Complexity’ – Dr. Ir.\nKatherina Gugerell\nThis research project aims to foster the understanding of\ncomplex urban problems by combining participatory processes with\nserious games in a co-located setting. In particular, the project\nseeks to explore how game mechanics can be used to engage the actor\ngroup of young adults to make informed decisions that have an\nimpact on their respective urban carbon footprints.\n‘INTENSSS-PA’ – Christian\nZuidema\nThe INTENSSS-PA project is a EU funded Horizon 2020 project that\nstudies the integration of sustainable energy measures, land uses\nand technologies within the spatial and socio economic landscape.\nIt is focused on the process of institutional innovation needed for\ndeveloping integrated sustainable energy plans.\n‘SMART Campus Zernike Groningen’ – Dr. Elen-Maarja\nTrell\nA research project carried out in collaboration with RIO\nprojects and the Municipality of Groningen with support from Regio\nGroningen Assen and Zernike Campus.\nOverview of publications and other activities\nResearch\ndatabase Faculty of Spatial Sciences\nOverview\nstaff Department of Spatial Planning and Environment\nSustainable\nRoad Infrastructure publications\nResearchGate\nDepartment of Spatial Planning and Environment\nThe Master's in Environmental and Infrastructure Planning is a\nchallenging and motivating program for planners who, like myself,\naim to contribute towards creating better places to live in, hence,\nmore habitable and sustainable cities. Moreover, it encompasses\naccurate planning concepts, tools and knowledge to solve the many\ndifficulties our cities experience.\nI was captivated by the passion by which the professors educate\nthe students, and in the way they develop an increased interest and\nunderstanding in different aspects of urban planning. Being a RUG\nstudent, I have broadened my knowledge and skills as a planner. In\nparticular, I have realized the importance of holistic bottom-up\napproaches, involving all the parties linked to a program or\nproject, who stand to be affected either in a positive or negative\nway.\nPersonally, I have enjoyed my stay in Groningen and I met\namazing people. My Master’s degree in Environmental and\nInfrastructure Planning has definitely opened many doors within the\nworking environment of my city.\n- Mariá Costanza Almeida\nIn the summer of 2021, I finished my bachelor's degree in\nSpatial Planning and Design at the Faculty of Spatial Sciences.\nWhile I started out the bachelor with a great interest in the\ndesign-element of it, I ended up graduating with an even greater\ninterest in the policymaking-element of spatial planning.\nDuring the bachelor, the focus subjects concerned\nwater management, environmental issues and mobility &\ninfrastructure. I very much enjoyed these subjects, and together\nwith my interest in policymaking, the Environmental and\nInfrastructure Planning master felt like a good match. And so, I\nstarted with my master’s degree in September of 2021.\nEnvironmental and Infrastructure Planning is a great program for\nthose who are interested in sustainability, the energy transition,\nand their impacts on the living environment. The courses in the\nprogram provide a good mix of content-related courses (such as\nReinventing Environmental Planning) and research-related courses\n(such as Comparative Research and Planning Practice). The program\ninvolves a great deal of group projects, that help you figure out\nyour role while working in teams. Also, the program offers the\nfreedom to focus your projects and reading materials on the\nsubjects that you find most interesting.\nDuring the Graduate Research Day where I presented my thesis, I\nencountered an alumnus of the faculty, who has introduced me to the\njob I am doing now. I now work for a public transport authority as\na policy advisor on public transport development. My goal is to\nencourage people to choose more sustainable modes of transport!\n- Tess ten Have\nThe motivation why I choose for the masters Environmental &\nInfrastructure Planning (EIP) and Society, Sustainability and\nPlanning (SSP) was to understand and counteract the, in my view,\nplanning and design processes that enforce personal examples of\ninjustice and inequality in the spatial domain. I am interested in\ngiving all actors a voice and the instruments or tools to make the\nphysical environment better for its users.\nThe different courses of the masters taught me\ndifferent theoretical and practical lenses of which I am still\ngrateful of and apply in my personal and working life.\nAt the moment I work as a consultant Smart Cities & Smart\nMobility for the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Water\nManagement. What is interesting is that I am most of the time busy\nwith making connections between people and programme’s. I\nbelieve that both masters enabled me to do so because you get to\nknow how the process of spatial planning works and you are aware of\nthe content with in-depth knowledge about sustainability, planning\nand stakeholder involvement. This may seem a bit odd, but in my\nexperience it appears to be a critical power and unique selling\npoint. Most of my colleagues do not have such a background and are\nnot always fully informed about the spatial consequences of their\nactions. A glimpse of programme’s I work on: 5G-Blueprint, a\npublic-private ecosystem for smart and sustainable urban\ndevelopment and the Dutch National Mobility Vision 2050.\nBesides, I started right after my master the company VRX which\nspecialises in using (Immersive) Virtual Reality (IVR) for\nco-creative spatial planning and design. VRX produces virtual\nenvironments where citizens can experience how for instance a\nplayground can look like based on different scenario’s.\nDuring design sessions with IVR we ask them to give their view on\nthe scenario’s so we are able to improve the scenario’s\nwhile working towards a final design.\nThe important thing about both masters is that they provide you\nwith a fruitful and professional knowledge base. After you finish\nyour master you can work in different working fields, for different\norganisations and connect them to each other (energy, water,\ntransport, housing, nature). I hope my personal experience after\nstudy and two years working underlines this and provides an\n(prospective) example for people interested in either or both\nmasters.\n- Roy Boertien\nThis infographic shows in which workfield alumni of the master's\nprogramme ended up, and is based on alumni who graduated between\n2022 and 2024.

      "content": "[HEADING] Courses master Environmental & Infrastructure Planning\n[HEADING] What will you learn?\n[HEADING] Dilemmas in Infrastructure Planning (5 EC)\n[HEADING] EIP: Interactive Workshop (5 EC)\n[HEADING] Planning Theory (5 EC)\n[HEADING] Comparative Research and Planning Practice (5 EC)\n[HEADING] Reinventing Environmental Planning (5 EC)\n[HEADING] Transitions in Water Management (5 EC)\n[HEADING] Masterthesis (20 EC)\n[HEADING] Related elective (5 EC)\n[HEADING] Elective (5 EC)\nWould you like to learn more about the sustainable planning of infrastructural projects? Are you concerned about environmental issues? Then EIP or one of the related Double Degree Master's is the programme for you!\nThe programme of the master Environmental & Infrastructure Planning (EIP) consists of the following courses. Click on the course title to go to the full course description, information about lecturers, literature and time period. The courses in this programme have been scored against the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Find a general overview of how all of our programmes relate to the SDGs.\nThis course focuses on network and governance dilemmas that arise in the planning and realization of different kinds of infrastructure networks. This module examines planning approaches for various types of major infrastructure in three thematic blocks; waterway, road and energy infrastructure networks. The central theme of this module are the dilemmas, issues and tensions in infrastructure planning which relate to e.g.: development vs protection; short- vs long-term interests; local vs global issues, individual vs general interests, centralization vs decentralization, government vs market intervention, strategic vs operational decision-making; general regulations vs individual responsibility, rational technicalities vs communicative processes. These dilemmas will be illustrated by case studies in a series of lectures at the start of the course.\nRelated SDG: 9 industry, innovation and infrastructure, 11 sustainable cities and communities\nThe course engages students interactively with seminal texts within environmental and infrastructure planning and enhances critical thinking on contemporary planning debates in theory and practice. Topics include collaborative planning and governance, rationality and power, complexity theory and planning, institutions and institutional change.\nRelated SDG: 11 sustainable cities and communities\nYou will gain more in-depth knowledge of the theoretical background of planning in such a way that you can identify suitable existing planning and decision-making models for issues at hand. You will also be able to picture a planning issue within a theoretical frame, through which an approach and its consequences can be deducted.\nThe aim of this course is to compare planning systems, practices and cultures in different countries (with a focus on Europe and Asia) and to draw lessons from such comparisons. The course will provide an overview of related planning practices, systems and their institutional design. In order to set the context and to explain the history and development of a particular planning system, one individual country is at the focus of each lecture. Within the context of each country subsequently the key institutions, powers, limitations and strengths of the planning system are explored through an examination of particular tools, themes and techniques that operate within.\nThe aim of the course is to provide you with theories and concepts to critically reflect on recent changes in environmental planning towards more proactive and integrated approaches in various fields of environmental planning (such as energy, urban development, air policy, nature and climate change). After this course, you should understand the potentials and pitfalls of existing and recently emerging policy approaches and to understand the contextual conditions influencing these potentials and pitfalls. Based on this understanding, you should also be able to make well-argued choices between different planning strategies and measures when faced with different environmental issues and circumstances. In doing so, you should be able to use substantive information about environmental issues that they acquired during the course on several of the main environmental challenges that our 21st century societies face.\nRelated SDG: 7 affordable and clean energy, 8 decent work and economic growth, 11 sustainable cities and communities, 13 climate action, 14 life below water, 15 life on land\nThe aim of this course is to provide students with theories and concepts to describe and explain current water management issues, such as the introduction of the flood risk management approach, and related water management transitions. The course focuses in particular on the management of open water bodies or surface water in delta areas where rivers and coastal areas come together – on creating resilient delta areas. After following this course, students are able to suggest and develop possible water management strategies and measures to manage water transitions.\nRelated SDG: 9 industry, innovation and infrastructure, 11 sustainable cities and communities, 15 life on land\nThe Master thesis involves an individual research project on issues relevant to environmental, infrastructure, and water planning. The aim of the project is to gain practical and comprehensive experience in doing scientific research.\nImpact Assessment and Policy Evaluation \n\nThis course provides you with knowledge about the smart use of impact and evaluation studies in governance. ‘Smart’ relates to a high performance of methods in governance; the use of innovative methods and available open data and crowdsourced data.\nEIP: Living Lab\nIn the EIP Living Lab you team up in small groups of 4 to 5 students to address a real-world planning and design issue. The assignment for each team is different, as they will be set by clients from various organisations, such as local, regional or (inter)national governments, businesses, NGO’s or citizen groups. You are asked to use your knowledge, skills and experience to provide a cutting edge, viable and credible (policy) advice for your client.\nProject and Programme Management (ID)\nThis course focuses on the different management strategies that are used in planning practice. We use a framework which distinguishes both between output and outcome-oriented management strategies as well as between internal and external orientation.\nFor an overview of possible courses, please visit our course catalogue Ocasys\n• Master Environmental & Infrastructure Planning (EIP)\n• Double Degree Master: Water and Coastal Management\n• Double Degree Master: Sustainable Water Management\n• Double Degree Master: Development Planning and Infrastructure Management\n• Double Degree Master: Urban Planning, Environment and Infrastucture\n• Double Degree Master: Urban Governance within a Global Environment\n[HTML_TABLE]\nLast modified: | 01 October 2024 11.09 a.m.\n[CARD]\nCourses master Environmental & Infrastructure Planning\n[CARD]\nFunctional\nFunctional\n\n                                Provides basic functions and uses anonymized cookies.\n[CARD]\nFunctional\nProvides basic functions and uses anonymized cookies.\n[CARD]\nFunctional\n[CARD]\nProvides basic functions and uses anonymized cookies.\n[CARD]\nStandard\nStandard\n\n                                Provides optimal operation and uses video cookies, among others.\n[CARD]\nStandard\nProvides optimal operation and uses video cookies, among others.\n[CARD]\nStandard\n[CARD]\nProvides optimal operation and uses video cookies, among others.\n[CARD]\nComplete\nComplete\n\n                                Provides personalized content and uses marketing cookies.\n[CARD]\nComplete\nProvides personalized content and uses marketing cookies.\n[CARD]\nComplete\n[CARD]\nProvides personalized content and uses marketing cookies.",
