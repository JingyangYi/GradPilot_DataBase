Sc.\n[HEADING] What you'll learn for your future?\n[HEADING] Study Information\n[HEADING] Facts and Structure\n[HEADING] Pre-study Internship\n[HEADING] Course Content\n[HEADING] Application and Admission\nThe master's program in Computational Mechanics at the TUM School of Engineering and Design is structured along the disciplines of structural and fluid mechanics, mathematics and computer science. Based on mechanical fundamentals, it aims to incorporate mathematical principles, computational methods and software development.\nNowadays and even more in the future, the development of sustainable and efficient engineering systems and products relies on computational mechanics simulations. The degree program thus focuses on solving real-world engineering problems of interest to society using numerical modeling and simulation methods. The small cohort size and the diverse international background of the students make this program ideal for interdisciplinary exchange of ideas and building a strong network for your future career.\nOur program enables you to take advantage of the rapid increase in computing resources to enhance complex mechanical systems with sophisticated numerical analysis. This will also enable you to develop resource-efficient and sustainable products that support the technological changes of the 21st century.\nWe believe that a solid engineering education is based on a deep understanding of the fundamental principles of solid mechanics, fluid mechanics and mathematics. Therefore, the program provides you with key skills in continuum and fluid mechanics, finite element analysis, and computational materials modeling. The course content includes computational fluid or structural dynamics in engineering, artificial intelligence and machine learning. Create your own curriculum from a variety of electives.\nAs a methods-oriented discipline, you will be well-prepared for a career in engineering, such as civil, mechanical, automotive, or aerospace engineering. Our research-oriented master's program trains highly qualified professionals for industry and academia to advance engineering simulation. We consider it a valuable sign of our education quality that about one third of our graduates go on to pursue doctoral studies. Join us at TUM and let us shape the future of computational mechanics together!\nMore information on the M.Sc.

Have you forgotten your password?\nYou can choose to view the wizard in English using the “DE/EN” button in the upper right hand corner.\n[CARD]\nYou can apply for all degree courses which are currently open for application. Outside of these time frames an application is not possible. You can find more info on application deadlines on the info pages about our degree courses.\nPlease note that you must submit a separate application for each degree program.\n[CARD]\nYou can find a list of the required documents on the info pages about the degree courses. Depending on the degree course you wish to apply for, you will need to prepare some things beforehand - an essay, for example. \nThe online application wizard will then guide you through the application. Online application guides\n[CARD]\nYou made a mistake during the online application? Don’t panic: personal data like your name, address, nationality etc. cannot be changed once the registration in TUMonline is complete. So please be sure to check your input thoroughly. If you make a mistake or a typo nonetheless, we will correct it once we check your documents. In subsequent applications, i.e. if you have already sent at least one online applications beforehand, you can no longer change specific data. This includes your university entrance qualification as well as your academic background. We also review and correct this information once your documents are processed.  \"Start of course\" and \"degree program\" are special cases. They determine many other factors during your online application, and can only be changed until you confirm the data you have given. After this, you will have to start a completely new application if you want to modify either aspect.   Once you send the online application, replacing the documents you uploaded is not allowed. So please make sure you select the correct files to upload. Be sure to wait for your documents to be checked before you contact us about a mistake or a typo. If the error still persists after your application has been reviewed, please contact studium@tum.de\n[CARD]\nThe online application is the first step of your application for a degree program at TUM. For applications for summer semester 2020 or later, you no longer have to submit any hardcopies at this point. \nThe second step is enrollment. This takes place only after you have received admission and accepted your study place. For enrollment, you will have to upload  certain documents in a specific form – e.g. bearing signature and seal or providing the possibility of digital verification. As soon as you have received admission and accepted your study place, the relevant information will appear in your TUMonline account. You can find an overview of the necessary steps for enrollment here: Enrollment via TUMonline.\nCheck the status of your application regularly in your TUMonline account.

After admission to our program\nPleae go through the following paragraphs carefully. They contain all the relevant information about your application to the Compuatational Mechanics program at TUM.\nThe application procedure for all master's programs at TUM is similar.\nGeneral information about applications at TUM can be found on the TUM application info portal.\nThe following topics are covered on this page:\nTUM offers scholarships, exemptions, and waivers for international students who must pay tuition fees. Please find further information here.\nVisit us at TUM's Master's Days 2025:\nThe intake for the Master's program Computational Mechanics is in October for the winter term each year. We do not offer an intake in spring or at any other date.\nPlease note that the first semester of COME starts one week ahead of the official lecture period with a welCoMe-week including a comprehensive Introduction to C++-course.\nThe application period is from 1 January to 31 May. Your application has to be fully completed online within this period.\nPlease note that we select our students carefully and that this process will take some time.\nTherefore, we will split the selection process into two parts: In the first part we will handle all applications which are sent until 15 March, in the second one we will handle the remaining applications.\nThe selection will take approximately 2 month, i.e. the admission letters will be available approximately latest\nPlease note that depending on the number of applications these are only rough estimates.\nIf you need to apply for a visa we therefore recommend to apply until the earlier deadline, i.e. 15 March.\n \nPlease note: A visa must be applied for well in advance of your departure (at least 2 months ahead of time).\nYou will need to apply for your visa at the embassy / consulate of the Federal Republic of Germany in your home country.\nApplicants from EU/EWR nations as well as some other nations are exempt from this regulation. You can check this overview of visa requirements/exemptions for entry into the Federal Republic of Germany issued by the Federal Foreign Office.\nFurther information on the exact dates, periods and deadlines for your application can be found on the TUM webpage on Application Deadlines.\nAll applicants who did not obtain their qualification for postgraduate studies (usually a bachelor's degree) in Germany have to hand in documents additionally to uni-assist.\nThis TUM webpage describes the additional application step via uni-assist.\nThe deadlines for handing in documents to uni-assist are, in general, the same as for your application at TUM. However, uni-assist needs additional processing time (up to 6 weeks). TUM will start processing your application only after receiving the results of the document check from uni-assist.\nTherefore, we strongly recommend handing in documents to uni-assist 6 weeks before the application deadline (15 March or 31 May).\nYou can have your documents reviewed by uni-assist at any time of the year. If the portal for the desired semester has not yet been opened at uni-assist, simply select the current semester. It does not matter whether you apply for the summer semester or the winter semester at uni-assist. Please note, however, that the application deadline at TUM must be met.\nIf you applied for the VPD before the application deadline but did not receive it in time, please upload this document instead of your VPD to the application portal. This way, your application is temporarily complete at the end of the application deadline. You are then granted a grace period to hand in your real VPD. Please upload your VPD to the portal as soon as you receive it. Please note that handing in the VPD after the application deadline is only possible if all documents required for generating the VPD arrive at uni-assist before the application deadline on 31 May.\nFor admission to the Computational Mechanics program, several technical/scientific requirements have to be fulfilled. Please note that the COME master's program requires a strong background in engineering, structural and/or applied mechanics!\nEligibility for the Master’s Program in Computational Mechanics is demonstrated by:\nPlease also take notice of the additional conditions for applicants with a degree from and Indian or Chinese/Vietnamese/Mongolian university (see below).\nThe application is done thorugh TUM's online portal TUMonline. In order to apply, please register there and complete the application form. Useful instructions for TUMonline are available on TUM's information page for applicants and students .\nIn a first step, all documents are handed in electronically. In case of an admission, applicants must then send several documents to the TUM Center for Study and Teaching by post.\nIn the following we list the documents that you will need to upload in your TUMonline applicant account. Please also use our application documents checklist provided in the documents section.\nYou will have to provide one of the following proofs:\nThe transcript of records or semester mark sheets listing your subjects and grades. If the transcript is not issued in English or German, we also need an officially authenticated translation. Please note: If the final degree certificate and/or the final year transcripts are not yet available on the date of application, complete certification of the first degree coursework and examination results (transcript of records) issued by the responsible examination authority or the responsible university office must be submitted. The copy must include the aggregate mark or graduate average, including an explanation of the grading system (maximum grade, minimum passing grade, etc.).\nWe require a curriculum vitae in table Formatted as a table and written in the English language;\nThe motivation letter needs to be written in the English language (500 words at maximum). Applicants should demonstrate what qualifies explicitly them for the Master’s Program in Computational Mechanics. You should explain why particularly you are eligible for the Master's Program in Computational Mechanics.\nThe essay needs to be written in English (500 words at maximum). Applicants should address the topic given out by the examination board each year. The topic will be announced until 15 December at the latest (see below). In the essay, you should show your technical knowledge in Computational Mechanics and demonstrate scientific and method-oriented working skills.\nThe topic of the essay for the application period in 2025 is:\nWe would like to learn about your personal and academic development expectations. Discuss which course from the curriculum in Computational Mechanics at TUM offers a good means to reach those expectations. Also, please indicate which courses, projects, or other activities from your Bachelor studies relate to the contents of that course.\nYou have to provide one letter of reference. Please use the appropriate  form (available in .pdf  in the download section). Please fill in your name, sign the form, and give this form to a professor or other person who is well acquainted with your academic work (no job reference). The recommender should use his or her own institutional letter paper to write the recommendation letter. Upload the filled out form and the letter.\nIf the recommender does not want to hand out the recommendation letter to you, he/she can also send it to come@tum.de.

For students starting until 2020, please refer to the corresponding curriculum page.\nTUM organizes it's studies via modules, which are separate units for which you will receive credits. Each module contains a set of lectures, tutorials, seminars, ... and (usually) one exam. Upon passing the exams in that module you will be rewarded the credits for the module.\nEach module has its own description, which can be accessed through the small book symbol in TUMonline:. You can check this page for more information about how modules, lectures and exams are organized in TUMonline.\nEach student has to complete 120 credits in total for the CoMe program, 90 credits from modules (course work) and 30 credits from the Master´s thesis. The 90 credits achieved through modules are divided into 4 parts.\nThe official study regulations as well as the study program documentation with a detailed course structure description in the documents section.\nFor more courses and extra-curricular events, please check out our additional further offers page.\nIn the following we give a detailed overview over the coursework in the Master's program Computational Mechanics.\nAll of the following six modules have to be succesfully passed. Please note that you have to have passed one of the following modules after the second semester\nWe offer the two core elective catalogues 'Mechanics' and 'Computation' with four elective subjects each. All modules give 6 ECTS. Out of each of the two core elective catalogues, 12 credits have to be obtained.\n*The part Theory of Plates can also be taken in the third semester, however, we recommend taking it in the first semester for didactic reasons.The exam is conducted as a single exam covering both parts. You have to make sure to register for exam BGU32033. It's not possible to take the two parts separately.The exams BGU32027P1 and BGU32027P2 are not valid for students with study start 2021 and later.\n**Theis module consist of two lectures. If you want to include this module in your Mechanics electives, make sure to register for the corresponding exam. It's not possible to account for this module by passing the individual subjects. If you're in doubt about these regulations, please do not hesitate to contact us at come@tum.de.\n*Interested students are welcome to join the Python course for engineers and scientists (LV-Nr: 0000003544) offered by Dr. Jithender Timothy in the lecture-free period before the summer and winter term. This will help you in the lectures and tutorials on AI in COME. No credits can be offered, however, a certificate will be issued for each participant completing the course.Participation is highly recommended. For further questions about the course, please contact Dr. Timothy (jithender.timothy@tum.de).\n**These modules consist of two lectures. If you want to include these modules in your Computation electives, make sure to register for the corresponding exam. It's not possible to account for these modules by passing the individual subjects. If you're in doubt about these regulations, please do not hesitate to contact us at come@tum.de.\n27 credits of elective modules during the second and third semester distributed according to the individual study plan, to be chosen from numerous module offers.\nAll (not selected) compulsory elective modules can alternatively be choosen as elective modules.\nNote that the range of elective modules might change from year to year dependent on the availability of guest lecturers.\n* Please contact Vijaya Holla (vijaya.holla@tum.de) in case you are interested to this course on a self-study basis. He will enroll you into the corresponding Moodle-course.** Currently offered by the Chair of Structural Analysis and Dynamics.\nThe Engineering Risk Analysis group offers the course \"Introduction to Random Vibration\" (ED130006, 6 ECTS) as an individual elective course in the summer term. If you're interested in the course, please contact your course coordinator (you can find our current contact information here in this wiki, so please do not hesitate to contact us).\n*Offered as an online, self-study course.\nDuring your studies, you can include a study project in your curriculum. Study projects are offered depending on availability and are often agreed upon between a supervisor and a student individually.\nIf you're interested in doing a study project, you can reach out to a professor or research assistant in COME whose research and topics you're interested in and ask whether there are topics for study projects.\nIn case you're in doubt, do not hesitate us via come@tum.de for further questions.\nStudent research project on Finite Elements in Simulation and Design\nAt least 17 out of the 27 elective credits have to be gained with modules from the official curriculum. That means we can accredit up to 10 credits from individually chosen modules (like courses in the ATHENS Program, modules offered by other departments in the TUM School of Engineering and Design (such as mechanical engineering), which are not listed in the official curriculum, etc.). You can find a list of individual elective courses that have been accepted in the past here. However, this list does not contain all courses that could be accepted as individual electives since there are too many courses that could be accredited as individual elecitve courses to list all of them. Generally, we can accredit most courses that either improve your knowledge in the theories behind methods of computational mechanics or deal with applications of computational mechanics. However, fundamental modules from bachelor studies or modules with contents very similar to modules from the COME curriculum are excepted from the accreditation.\nIf you want to take an individual elective course, please ask the course coordinator whether it can be accredited as an individual elective. This is also necessary in case the course is listed in the above file. The reason for this procedure is that individual elective courses are not part of your curriculum but must be added to it manually. This is done by the examination administrator, who requires a confirmation from the course coordinator in order to add this course to your curriculum.\nFor the registration, please select free registration in TUM online since the individual elective courses are initially not part of your curriculum. As soon as you passed the exam, please inform the examination administrator so that the individual elective course gets accredited and added to your curriculum.\nIf you, for example, want to gain further knowledge in aerospace, you could take the courses \"Aeroelasticity\" (MW2228) and \"Aircraft Performance\" (MW0832). Both courses are worth 5 ECTS each. Therefore, you would have excatly 10 ECTS of individual electives. Within the categroy of electives, you then need at least 17 ECTS from the CoMe curriculum. Since most courses in CoMe are either worth 3 or 6 ECTS, you will probably not achieve excatly 17 ECTS but overshoot and achieve for example 18 ECTS. However, this is not a problem at all since you can finish your program also with more than 120 ECTS.\nAnother example: If you want to take more courses about machine leraning and deep learning, you could take the course \"Introduction to Deep Learning\" (IN2346). This course is worth 6 ECTS. Please note here, that we cannot cut the credits of modules so that they fit excatly 10 ECTS! Therefore, you could not take \"Advanced Deep Learning for Physics\" (IN2298) additionally to \"Introduction to Deep Learning\" because both courses are worth 12 ECTS together. Instead, you could only take a further course worth maximum 4 ECTS. However, you also don't have to take exactly 10 ECTS of individual electives, so you could also just take one of the two courses and then require at least 21 ECTS of elective courses from the CoMe curriculum.\n3 credits of general elective modules, to be chosen from numerous module offers.\nDue to the large number of module offers, you won't find specific modules in the curriculum in TUMonline. We will announce more modules in time and fill the list with standard offers. If you found a module that you are interested, please do not hesitate to contact us.\nLanguage courses can be accounted for within the general education modules. You can find a list of offers on the website of the language center and in TUMonline.\nThe following rules apply:\nIf a specific course is not linked to our curriculum in TUMonline, please write an e-mail to come@tum.de.\nA lot of general education courses and workshops are offered by the Center of Key Competencies. You will find all the information about their courses on the website and the corresponding Wiki.\nA lot of seminars and workshops can also be found at the TUM School of Social Sciences and Technology within the Science ⋈ Technology ⋈ Society (Kontextlehre WTG) program.\nMost of the courses that are offered in English are linked to our curriculum in TUMonline. If a specific course is missing, please write an e-mail to come@tum.de.\nThe Virtuelle Hochschule Bayern (VHB) is a joint institution connecting universities across Bavaria. It offers a variety of online courses that can be taken by students enrolled at a Bavarian university.\nYou can check the current course offers in the VHB course catalog. Recognition within the general electives profile is granted upon request. Please write an informal mail stating the course title to come@tum.de and ask for recognition of the specific course.\nCourses from VHB are not linked to the curriculum in TUMonline.\nAfter the successful completion of the program (120 credits), students are awarded a Master of Science. Additionally, highly qualified students can join the Bavarian Graduate School of Computational Engineering and follow the honours program described here.\nEligible candidates are then also entitled to study towards a doctoral degree without having to meet additional academic requirements.\n• Pages\n• Blog\n• Boards\n• Remove Read Confirmation\n             \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Attachments (4)\n             \n\n\n\n\n                                Page History\n             \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Page Information\n             \n\n\n\n\n                                Resolved comments\n             \n\n\n\n\n                                View in Hierarchy\n             \n\n\n\n\n                                View Source\n             \n\n\n\n\n                                Export to PDF\n             \n\n\n\n\n                                Export to Word\n             \n\n\n\n\n                                Export to PDF\n             \n\n\n\n\n                                Export to Word\n• Remove Read Confirmation\n• Attachments (4)\n• Page History\n• Page Information\n• Resolved comments\n• View in Hierarchy\n• View Source\n• Export to PDF\n• Export to Word\n• Export to PDF\n• Export to Word\n• Remove Read Confirmation\n• Attachments (4)\n• Page History\n• Page Information\n• Resolved comments\n• View in Hierarchy\n• View Source\n• Export to PDF\n• Export to Word\n• Export to PDF\n• Export to Word\n• Jira links\n• Workflow\n• Read Confirmation\n• Languages\n• Translate page\n• Created by  Felix Schneider, last updated on 23.
