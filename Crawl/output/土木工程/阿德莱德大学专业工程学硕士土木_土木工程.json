geotechnics, transportation, water resource management, consulting, project management, and more.   \nYou could design earthquake-resistant buildings, improving safety for people living in areas prone to frequent seismic activity. Maybe you’ll facilitate a city’s transition to 100% renewable energy through the development of offshore wind farms, solar energy parks, or hydroelectric dams.   \nNo matter your career goals, there’s a path for you. You could work in a wide range of sectors including:    \nConstruction  Transportation   Water resources  Environmental engineering  Geotechnical engineering  Structural engineering  Urban planning and development.  \n Industry trends \nAdoption of smart technologies including building information modelling (BIM), Internet of Things (IoT) devices, digital twins and application of artificial intelligence and machine learning are driving digital transformation in the civil engineering sector. These technologies are being utilised to enable more sustainable, efficient and resilient infrastructure development. Civil engineers with the expertise to leverage these technologies are in high demand by employers. \nGlobally and in Australia, there is an engineering skills shortage. Demand for qualified engineers across all sectors continues to outstrip supply (Engineers Australia, 2023).  \n Major public infrastructure spend is projected to reach $230 billion by 2027 in Australia alone. This, combined with a projected shortfall of 229,000 full-time infrastructure workers, makes civil engineers the most in demand engineering specialist by industry (Infrastructure Australia, 2023).  \nAccreditation\nThis program is currently undergoing assessment for accreditation by Engineers Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReady to apply?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Check your eligibility\n    \nBefore you begin, find the degree you wish to study and check you meet the academic entry requirements and English language requirements.\n\n\n\n        Entry requirements \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Gather your relevant documents\n    \nEnsure you have all supporting documentation needed at the time of application to avoid delays.\n\n\n\n        How to apply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Complete and send your application\n    \nApply through one of the University’s official agency partners, or via our online application system.\n\n\n\n        Apply now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that a non-refundable application fee of AUD$150 applies for every application submitted to Adelaide University.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to apply\n\nApplications for international students are open now, to begin your studies in 2026.\nApply through one of the University’s official Education Agents, or via our International Application System.\nFind an Education Agent\nDepending on your country of citizenship, you may be required to apply through one of our Education Agents.\n\n\n\n                                        Find an education agent in your country\n                                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAQs\nExplore answers to some of our most frequently asked questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen can I apply to study at Adelaide University as a domestic student? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplications for Australian students to study at Adelaide University will open in August 2025. Applications will be via SATAC for most undergraduate and postgraduate coursework programs. \nApplications to study a 100% online degree will open in July 2025 via a direct application process. \nIn the meantime, you could start your studies at UniSA or the University of Adelaide in 2025 and continue on to Adelaide University in 2026.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat campuses and facilities does Adelaide University have?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdelaide University is South Australia’s largest university with seven campuses across the state.

geotechnics, transportation, water resource management, consulting, project management, and more.   \nYou could design earthquake-resistant buildings, improving safety for people living in areas prone to frequent seismic activity. Maybe you’ll facilitate a city’s transition to 100% renewable energy through the development of offshore wind farms, solar energy parks, or hydroelectric dams.   \nNo matter your career goals, there’s a path for you. You could work in a wide range of sectors including:    \nConstruction  Transportation   Water resources  Environmental engineering  Geotechnical engineering  Structural engineering  Urban planning and development.  \n Industry trends \nAdoption of smart technologies including building information modelling (BIM), Internet of Things (IoT) devices, digital twins and application of artificial intelligence and machine learning are driving digital transformation in the civil engineering sector. These technologies are being utilised to enable more sustainable, efficient and resilient infrastructure development. Civil engineers with the expertise to leverage these technologies are in high demand by employers. \nGlobally and in Australia, there is an engineering skills shortage. Demand for qualified engineers across all sectors continues to outstrip supply (Engineers Australia, 2023).  \n Major public infrastructure spend is projected to reach $230 billion by 2027 in Australia alone. This, combined with a projected shortfall of 229,000 full-time infrastructure workers, makes civil engineers the most in demand engineering specialist by industry (Infrastructure Australia, 2023).  \nAccreditation\nThis program is currently undergoing assessment for accreditation by Engineers Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReady to apply?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Check your eligibility\n    \nBefore you begin, find the degree you wish to study and check you meet the academic entry requirements and English language requirements.\n\n\n\n        Entry requirements \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Gather your relevant documents\n    \nEnsure you have all supporting documentation needed at the time of application to avoid delays.\n\n\n\n        How to apply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Complete and send your application\n    \nApply through one of the University’s official agency partners, or via our online application system.\n\n\n\n        Apply now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that a non-refundable application fee of AUD$150 applies for every application submitted to Adelaide University.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to apply\n\nApplications for international students are open now, to begin your studies in 2026.\nApply through one of the University’s official Education Agents, or via our International Application System.\nFind an Education Agent\nDepending on your country of citizenship, you may be required to apply through one of our Education Agents.\n\n\n\n                                        Find an education agent in your country\n                                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAQs\nExplore answers to some of our most frequently asked questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen can I apply to study at Adelaide University as a domestic student? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplications for Australian students to study at Adelaide University will open in August 2025. Applications will be via SATAC for most undergraduate and postgraduate coursework programs. \nApplications to study a 100% online degree will open in July 2025 via a direct application process. \nIn the meantime, you could start your studies at UniSA or the University of Adelaide in 2025 and continue on to Adelaide University in 2026.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat campuses and facilities does Adelaide University have?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdelaide University is South Australia’s largest university with seven campuses across the state.

geotechnics, transportation, water resource management, consulting, project management, and more.   \nYou could design earthquake-resistant buildings, improving safety for people living in areas prone to frequent seismic activity. Maybe you’ll facilitate a city’s transition to 100% renewable energy through the development of offshore wind farms, solar energy parks, or hydroelectric dams.   \nNo matter your career goals, there’s a path for you. You could work in a wide range of sectors including:    \nConstruction  Transportation   Water resources  Environmental engineering  Geotechnical engineering  Structural engineering  Urban planning and development.  \n Industry trends \nAdoption of smart technologies including building information modelling (BIM), Internet of Things (IoT) devices, digital twins and application of artificial intelligence and machine learning are driving digital transformation in the civil engineering sector. These technologies are being utilised to enable more sustainable, efficient and resilient infrastructure development. Civil engineers with the expertise to leverage these technologies are in high demand by employers. \nGlobally and in Australia, there is an engineering skills shortage. Demand for qualified engineers across all sectors continues to outstrip supply (Engineers Australia, 2023).  \n Major public infrastructure spend is projected to reach $230 billion by 2027 in Australia alone. This, combined with a projected shortfall of 229,000 full-time infrastructure workers, makes civil engineers the most in demand engineering specialist by industry (Infrastructure Australia, 2023).  \nAccreditation\nThis program is currently undergoing assessment for accreditation by Engineers Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReady to apply?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Check your eligibility\n    \nBefore you begin, find the degree you wish to study and check you meet the academic entry requirements and English language requirements.\n\n\n\n        Entry requirements \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Gather your relevant documents\n    \nEnsure you have all supporting documentation needed at the time of application to avoid delays.\n\n\n\n        How to apply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Complete and send your application\n    \nApply through one of the University’s official agency partners, or via our online application system.\n\n\n\n        Apply now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that a non-refundable application fee of AUD$150 applies for every application submitted to Adelaide University.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to apply\n\nApplications for international students are open now, to begin your studies in 2026.\nApply through one of the University’s official Education Agents, or via our International Application System.\nFind an Education Agent\nDepending on your country of citizenship, you may be required to apply through one of our Education Agents.\n\n\n\n                                        Find an education agent in your country\n                                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAQs\nExplore answers to some of our most frequently asked questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen can I apply to study at Adelaide University as a domestic student? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplications for Australian students to study at Adelaide University will open in August 2025. Applications will be via SATAC for most undergraduate and postgraduate coursework programs. \nApplications to study a 100% online degree will open in July 2025 via a direct application process. \nIn the meantime, you could start your studies at UniSA or the University of Adelaide in 2025 and continue on to Adelaide University in 2026.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat campuses and facilities does Adelaide University have?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdelaide University is South Australia’s largest university with seven campuses across the state.

covering construction, geotechnics, transportation, water resource management, consulting, project management, and more.   \nYou could design earthquake-resistant buildings, improving safety for people living in areas prone to frequent seismic activity. Maybe you’ll facilitate a city’s transition to 100% renewable energy through the development of offshore wind farms, solar energy parks, or hydroelectric dams.   \nNo matter your career goals, there’s a path for you. You could work in a wide range of sectors including:    \nConstruction  Transportation   Water resources  Environmental engineering  Geotechnical engineering  Structural engineering  Urban planning and development.  \n Industry trends \nAdoption of smart technologies including building information modelling (BIM), Internet of Things (IoT) devices, digital twins and application of artificial intelligence and machine learning are driving digital transformation in the civil engineering sector. These technologies are being utilised to enable more sustainable, efficient and resilient infrastructure development. Civil engineers with the expertise to leverage these technologies are in high demand by employers. \nGlobally and in Australia, there is an engineering skills shortage. Demand for qualified engineers across all sectors continues to outstrip supply (Engineers Australia, 2023).  \n Major public infrastructure spend is projected to reach $230 billion by 2027 in Australia alone. This, combined with a projected shortfall of 229,000 full-time infrastructure workers, makes civil engineers the most in demand engineering specialist by industry (Infrastructure Australia, 2023).  \nAccreditation\nThis program is currently undergoing assessment for accreditation by Engineers Australia.\nCheck your eligibility\n    \nBefore you begin, find the degree you wish to study and check you meet the academic entry requirements and English language requirements.\n\n\n\n        Entry requirements \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Gather your relevant documents\n    \nEnsure you have all supporting documentation needed at the time of application to avoid delays.\n\n\n\n        How to apply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Complete and send your application\n    \nApply through one of the University’s official agency partners, or via our online application system.\n\n\n\n        Apply now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that a non-refundable application fee of AUD$150 applies for every application submitted to Adelaide University.\nCheck your eligibility\n    \nBefore you begin, find the degree you wish to study and check you meet the academic entry requirements and English language requirements.\n\n\n\n        Entry requirements \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Gather your relevant documents\n    \nEnsure you have all supporting documentation needed at the time of application to avoid delays.\n\n\n\n        How to apply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Complete and send your application\n    \nApply through one of the University’s official agency partners, or via our online application system.\n\n\n\n        Apply now\nCheck your eligibility\n    \nBefore you begin, find the degree you wish to study and check you meet the academic entry requirements and English language requirements.\n\n\n\n        Entry requirements \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Gather your relevant documents\n    \nEnsure you have all supporting documentation needed at the time of application to avoid delays.\n\n\n\n        How to apply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Complete and send your application\n    \nApply through one of the University’s official agency partners, or via our online application system.\n\n\n\n        Apply now\nCheck your eligibility\n    \nBefore you begin, find the degree you wish to study and check you meet the academic entry requirements and English language requirements.\n\n\n\n        Entry requirements\nCheck your eligibility\n    \nBefore you begin, find the degree you wish to study and check you meet the academic entry requirements and English language requirements.\n\n\n\n        Entry requirements\nGather your relevant documents\n    \nEnsure you have all supporting documentation needed at the time of application to avoid delays.\n\n\n\n        How to apply\nGather your relevant documents\n    \nEnsure you have all supporting documentation needed at the time of application to avoid delays.\n\n\n\n        How to apply\nComplete and send your application\n    \nApply through one of the University’s official agency partners, or via our online application system.\n\n\n\n        Apply now\nComplete and send your application\n    \nApply through one of the University’s official agency partners, or via our online application system.\n\n\n\n        Apply now\nPlease note that a non-refundable application fee of AUD$150 applies for every application submitted to Adelaide University.\nFAQs\nExplore answers to some of our most frequently asked questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen can I apply to study at Adelaide University as a domestic student? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplications for Australian students to study at Adelaide University will open in August 2025. Applications will be via SATAC for most undergraduate and postgraduate coursework programs. \nApplications to study a 100% online degree will open in July 2025 via a direct application process. \nIn the meantime, you could start your studies at UniSA or the University of Adelaide in 2025 and continue on to Adelaide University in 2026.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat campuses and facilities does Adelaide University have?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdelaide University is South Australia’s largest university with seven campuses across the state.

geotechnics, transportation, water resource management, consulting, project management, and more.   \nYou could design earthquake-resistant buildings, improving safety for people living in areas prone to frequent seismic activity. Maybe you’ll facilitate a city’s transition to 100% renewable energy through the development of offshore wind farms, solar energy parks, or hydroelectric dams.   \nNo matter your career goals, there’s a path for you. You could work in a wide range of sectors including:    \nConstruction  Transportation   Water resources  Environmental engineering  Geotechnical engineering  Structural engineering  Urban planning and development.  \n Industry trends \nAdoption of smart technologies including building information modelling (BIM), Internet of Things (IoT) devices, digital twins and application of artificial intelligence and machine learning are driving digital transformation in the civil engineering sector. These technologies are being utilised to enable more sustainable, efficient and resilient infrastructure development. Civil engineers with the expertise to leverage these technologies are in high demand by employers. \nGlobally and in Australia, there is an engineering skills shortage. Demand for qualified engineers across all sectors continues to outstrip supply (Engineers Australia, 2023).  \n Major public infrastructure spend is projected to reach $230 billion by 2027 in Australia alone. This, combined with a projected shortfall of 229,000 full-time infrastructure workers, makes civil engineers the most in demand engineering specialist by industry (Infrastructure Australia, 2023).  \nAccreditation\nThis program is currently undergoing assessment for accreditation by Engineers Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReady to apply?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Check your eligibility\n    \nBefore you begin, find the degree you wish to study and check you meet the academic entry requirements and English language requirements.\n\n\n\n        Entry requirements \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Gather your relevant documents\n    \nEnsure you have all supporting documentation needed at the time of application to avoid delays.\n\n\n\n        How to apply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Complete and send your application\n    \nApply through one of the University’s official agency partners, or via our online application system.\n\n\n\n        Apply now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that a non-refundable application fee of AUD$150 applies for every application submitted to Adelaide University.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to apply\n\nApplications for international students are open now, to begin your studies in 2026.\nApply through one of the University’s official Education Agents, or via our International Application System.\nFind an Education Agent\nDepending on your country of citizenship, you may be required to apply through one of our Education Agents.\n\n\n\n                                        Find an education agent in your country\n                                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAQs\nExplore answers to some of our most frequently asked questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen can I apply to study at Adelaide University as a domestic student? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplications for Australian students to study at Adelaide University will open in August 2025. Applications will be via SATAC for most undergraduate and postgraduate coursework programs. \nApplications to study a 100% online degree will open in July 2025 via a direct application process. \nIn the meantime, you could start your studies at UniSA or the University of Adelaide in 2025 and continue on to Adelaide University in 2026.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat campuses and facilities does Adelaide University have?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdelaide University is South Australia’s largest university with seven campuses across the state.

Maybe you’ll facilitate a city’s transition to 100% renewable energy through the development of offshore wind farms, solar energy parks, or hydroelectric dams.   \nNo matter your career goals, there’s a path for you. You could work in a wide range of sectors including:    \nConstruction  Transportation   Water resources  Environmental engineering  Geotechnical engineering  Structural engineering  Urban planning and development.  \n Industry trends \nAdoption of smart technologies including building information modelling (BIM), Internet of Things (IoT) devices, digital twins and application of artificial intelligence and machine learning are driving digital transformation in the civil engineering sector. These technologies are being utilised to enable more sustainable, efficient and resilient infrastructure development. Civil engineers with the expertise to leverage these technologies are in high demand by employers. \nGlobally and in Australia, there is an engineering skills shortage. Demand for qualified engineers across all sectors continues to outstrip supply (Engineers Australia, 2023).  \n Major public infrastructure spend is projected to reach $230 billion by 2027 in Australia alone. This, combined with a projected shortfall of 229,000 full-time infrastructure workers, makes civil engineers the most in demand engineering specialist by industry (Infrastructure Australia, 2023).  \nAccreditation\nThis program is currently undergoing assessment for accreditation by Engineers Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReady to apply?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Check your eligibility\n    \nBefore you begin, find the degree you wish to study and check you meet the academic entry requirements and English language requirements.\n\n\n\n        Entry requirements \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Gather your relevant documents\n    \nEnsure you have all supporting documentation needed at the time of application to avoid delays.\n\n\n\n        How to apply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Complete and send your application\n    \nApply through one of the University’s official agency partners, or via our online application system.\n\n\n\n        Apply now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that a non-refundable application fee of AUD$150 applies for every application submitted to Adelaide University.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to apply\n\nApplications for international students are open now, to begin your studies in 2026.\nApply through one of the University’s official Education Agents, or via our International Application System.\nFind an Education Agent\nDepending on your country of citizenship, you may be required to apply through one of our Education Agents.\n\n\n\n                                        Find an education agent in your country\n                                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAQs\nExplore answers to some of our most frequently asked questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen can I apply to study at Adelaide University as a domestic student? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplications for Australian students to study at Adelaide University will open in August 2025. Applications will be via SATAC for most undergraduate and postgraduate coursework programs. \nApplications to study a 100% online degree will open in July 2025 via a direct application process. \nIn the meantime, you could start your studies at UniSA or the University of Adelaide in 2025 and continue on to Adelaide University in 2026.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat campuses and facilities does Adelaide University have?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdelaide University is South Australia’s largest university with seven campuses across the state.

covering construction, geotechnics, transportation, water resource management, consulting, project management, and more.   \nYou could design earthquake-resistant buildings, improving safety for people living in areas prone to frequent seismic activity. Maybe you’ll facilitate a city’s transition to 100% renewable energy through the development of offshore wind farms, solar energy parks, or hydroelectric dams.   \nNo matter your career goals, there’s a path for you. You could work in a wide range of sectors including:    \nConstruction  Transportation   Water resources  Environmental engineering  Geotechnical engineering  Structural engineering  Urban planning and development.  \n Industry trends \nAdoption of smart technologies including building information modelling (BIM), Internet of Things (IoT) devices, digital twins and application of artificial intelligence and machine learning are driving digital transformation in the civil engineering sector. These technologies are being utilised to enable more sustainable, efficient and resilient infrastructure development. Civil engineers with the expertise to leverage these technologies are in high demand by employers. \nGlobally and in Australia, there is an engineering skills shortage.

This, combined with a projected shortfall of 229,000 full-time infrastructure workers, makes civil engineers the most in demand engineering specialist by industry (Infrastructure Australia, 2023).  \nAccreditation\nThis program is currently undergoing assessment for accreditation by Engineers Australia.\nCheck your eligibility\n    \nBefore you begin, find the degree you wish to study and check you meet the academic entry requirements and English language requirements.\n\n\n\n        Entry requirements \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Gather your relevant documents\n    \nEnsure you have all supporting documentation needed at the time of application to avoid delays.\n\n\n\n        How to apply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Complete and send your application\n    \nApply through one of the University’s official agency partners, or via our online application system.\n\n\n\n        Apply now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that a non-refundable application fee of AUD$150 applies for every application submitted to Adelaide University.\nCheck your eligibility\n    \nBefore you begin, find the degree you wish to study and check you meet the academic entry requirements and English language requirements.\n\n\n\n        Entry requirements \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Gather your relevant documents\n    \nEnsure you have all supporting documentation needed at the time of application to avoid delays.\n\n\n\n        How to apply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Complete and send your application\n    \nApply through one of the University’s official agency partners, or via our online application system.\n\n\n\n        Apply now\nCheck your eligibility\n    \nBefore you begin, find the degree you wish to study and check you meet the academic entry requirements and English language requirements.\n\n\n\n        Entry requirements \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Gather your relevant documents\n    \nEnsure you have all supporting documentation needed at the time of application to avoid delays.\n\n\n\n        How to apply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Complete and send your application\n    \nApply through one of the University’s official agency partners, or via our online application system.\n\n\n\n        Apply now\nCheck your eligibility\n    \nBefore you begin, find the degree you wish to study and check you meet the academic entry requirements and English language requirements.\n\n\n\n        Entry requirements\nCheck your eligibility\n    \nBefore you begin, find the degree you wish to study and check you meet the academic entry requirements and English language requirements.\n\n\n\n        Entry requirements\nGather your relevant documents\n    \nEnsure you have all supporting documentation needed at the time of application to avoid delays.\n\n\n\n        How to apply\nGather your relevant documents\n    \nEnsure you have all supporting documentation needed at the time of application to avoid delays.\n\n\n\n        How to apply\nComplete and send your application\n    \nApply through one of the University’s official agency partners, or via our online application system.\n\n\n\n        Apply now\nComplete and send your application\n    \nApply through one of the University’s official agency partners, or via our online application system.\n\n\n\n        Apply now\nPlease note that a non-refundable application fee of AUD$150 applies for every application submitted to Adelaide University.\nFAQs\nExplore answers to some of our most frequently asked questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen can I apply to study at Adelaide University as a domestic student? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplications for Australian students to study at Adelaide University will open in August 2025. Applications will be via SATAC for most undergraduate and postgraduate coursework programs. \nApplications to study a 100% online degree will open in July 2025 via a direct application process. \nIn the meantime, you could start your studies at UniSA or the University of Adelaide in 2025 and continue on to Adelaide University in 2026.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat campuses and facilities does Adelaide University have?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdelaide University is South Australia’s largest university with seven campuses across the state.

geotechnics, transportation, water resource management, consulting, project management, and more.   \nYou could design earthquake-resistant buildings, improving safety for people living in areas prone to frequent seismic activity. Maybe you’ll facilitate a city’s transition to 100% renewable energy through the development of offshore wind farms, solar energy parks, or hydroelectric dams.   \nNo matter your career goals, there’s a path for you. You could work in a wide range of sectors including:    \nConstruction  Transportation   Water resources  Environmental engineering  Geotechnical engineering  Structural engineering  Urban planning and development.  \n Industry trends \nAdoption of smart technologies including building information modelling (BIM), Internet of Things (IoT) devices, digital twins and application of artificial intelligence and machine learning are driving digital transformation in the civil engineering sector. These technologies are being utilised to enable more sustainable, efficient and resilient infrastructure development. Civil engineers with the expertise to leverage these technologies are in high demand by employers. \nGlobally and in Australia, there is an engineering skills shortage. Demand for qualified engineers across all sectors continues to outstrip supply (Engineers Australia, 2023).  \n Major public infrastructure spend is projected to reach $230 billion by 2027 in Australia alone. This, combined with a projected shortfall of 229,000 full-time infrastructure workers, makes civil engineers the most in demand engineering specialist by industry (Infrastructure Australia, 2023).  \nAccreditation\nThis program is currently undergoing assessment for accreditation by Engineers Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReady to apply?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Check your eligibility\n    \nBefore you begin, find the degree you wish to study and check you meet the academic entry requirements and English language requirements.\n\n\n\n        Entry requirements \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Gather your relevant documents\n    \nEnsure you have all supporting documentation needed at the time of application to avoid delays.\n\n\n\n        How to apply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Complete and send your application\n    \nApply through one of the University’s official agency partners, or via our online application system.\n\n\n\n        Apply now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that a non-refundable application fee of AUD$150 applies for every application submitted to Adelaide University.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to apply\n\nApplications for international students are open now, to begin your studies in 2026.\nApply through one of the University’s official Education Agents, or via our International Application System.\nFind an Education Agent\nDepending on your country of citizenship, you may be required to apply through one of our Education Agents.\n\n\n\n                                        Find an education agent in your country\n                                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAQs\nExplore answers to some of our most frequently asked questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen can I apply to study at Adelaide University as a domestic student? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplications for Australian students to study at Adelaide University will open in August 2025. Applications will be via SATAC for most undergraduate and postgraduate coursework programs. \nApplications to study a 100% online degree will open in July 2025 via a direct application process. \nIn the meantime, you could start your studies at UniSA or the University of Adelaide in 2025 and continue on to Adelaide University in 2026.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat campuses and facilities does Adelaide University have?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdelaide University is South Australia’s largest university with seven campuses across the state.

geotechnics, transportation, water resource management, consulting, project management, and more.   \nYou could design earthquake-resistant buildings, improving safety for people living in areas prone to frequent seismic activity. Maybe you’ll facilitate a city’s transition to 100% renewable energy through the development of offshore wind farms, solar energy parks, or hydroelectric dams.   \nNo matter your career goals, there’s a path for you. You could work in a wide range of sectors including:    \nConstruction  Transportation   Water resources  Environmental engineering  Geotechnical engineering  Structural engineering  Urban planning and development.  \n Industry trends \nAdoption of smart technologies including building information modelling (BIM), Internet of Things (IoT) devices, digital twins and application of artificial intelligence and machine learning are driving digital transformation in the civil engineering sector. These technologies are being utilised to enable more sustainable, efficient and resilient infrastructure development. Civil engineers with the expertise to leverage these technologies are in high demand by employers. \nGlobally and in Australia, there is an engineering skills shortage. Demand for qualified engineers across all sectors continues to outstrip supply (Engineers Australia, 2023).  \n Major public infrastructure spend is projected to reach $230 billion by 2027 in Australia alone. This, combined with a projected shortfall of 229,000 full-time infrastructure workers, makes civil engineers the most in demand engineering specialist by industry (Infrastructure Australia, 2023).  \nAccreditation\nThis program is currently undergoing assessment for accreditation by Engineers Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReady to apply?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Check your eligibility\n    \nBefore you begin, find the degree you wish to study and check you meet the academic entry requirements and English language requirements.\n\n\n\n        Entry requirements \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Gather your relevant documents\n    \nEnsure you have all supporting documentation needed at the time of application to avoid delays.\n\n\n\n        How to apply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Complete and send your application\n    \nApply through one of the University’s official agency partners, or via our online application system.\n\n\n\n        Apply now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that a non-refundable application fee of AUD$150 applies for every application submitted to Adelaide University.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to apply\n\nApplications for international students are open now, to begin your studies in 2026.\nApply through one of the University’s official Education Agents, or via our International Application System.\nFind an Education Agent\nDepending on your country of citizenship, you may be required to apply through one of our Education Agents.\n\n\n\n                                        Find an education agent in your country\n                                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAQs\nExplore answers to some of our most frequently asked questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen can I apply to study at Adelaide University as a domestic student? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplications for Australian students to study at Adelaide University will open in August 2025. Applications will be via SATAC for most undergraduate and postgraduate coursework programs. \nApplications to study a 100% online degree will open in July 2025 via a direct application process. \nIn the meantime, you could start your studies at UniSA or the University of Adelaide in 2025 and continue on to Adelaide University in 2026.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat campuses and facilities does Adelaide University have?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdelaide University is South Australia’s largest university with seven campuses across the state.

covering construction, geotechnics, transportation, water resource management, consulting, project management, and more.   \nYou could design earthquake-resistant buildings, improving safety for people living in areas prone to frequent seismic activity. Maybe you’ll facilitate a city’s transition to 100% renewable energy through the development of offshore wind farms, solar energy parks, or hydroelectric dams.   \nNo matter your career goals, there’s a path for you. You could work in a wide range of sectors including:    \nConstruction  Transportation   Water resources  Environmental engineering  Geotechnical engineering  Structural engineering  Urban planning and development.  \n Industry trends \nAdoption of smart technologies including building information modelling (BIM), Internet of Things (IoT) devices, digital twins and application of artificial intelligence and machine learning are driving digital transformation in the civil engineering sector. These technologies are being utilised to enable more sustainable, efficient and resilient infrastructure development. Civil engineers with the expertise to leverage these technologies are in high demand by employers. \nGlobally and in Australia, there is an engineering skills shortage. Demand for qualified engineers across all sectors continues to outstrip supply (Engineers Australia, 2023).  \n Major public infrastructure spend is projected to reach $230 billion by 2027 in Australia alone. This, combined with a projected shortfall of 229,000 full-time infrastructure workers, makes civil engineers the most in demand engineering specialist by industry (Infrastructure Australia, 2023).  \nAccreditation\nThis program is currently undergoing assessment for accreditation by Engineers Australia.\nCheck your eligibility\n    \nBefore you begin, find the degree you wish to study and check you meet the academic entry requirements and English language requirements.\n\n\n\n        Entry requirements \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Gather your relevant documents\n    \nEnsure you have all supporting documentation needed at the time of application to avoid delays.\n\n\n\n        How to apply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Complete and send your application\n    \nApply through one of the University’s official agency partners, or via our online application system.\n\n\n\n        Apply now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that a non-refundable application fee of AUD$150 applies for every application submitted to Adelaide University.\nCheck your eligibility\n    \nBefore you begin, find the degree you wish to study and check you meet the academic entry requirements and English language requirements.\n\n\n\n        Entry requirements \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Gather your relevant documents\n    \nEnsure you have all supporting documentation needed at the time of application to avoid delays.\n\n\n\n        How to apply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Complete and send your application\n    \nApply through one of the University’s official agency partners, or via our online application system.\n\n\n\n        Apply now\nCheck your eligibility\n    \nBefore you begin, find the degree you wish to study and check you meet the academic entry requirements and English language requirements.\n\n\n\n        Entry requirements \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Gather your relevant documents\n    \nEnsure you have all supporting documentation needed at the time of application to avoid delays.\n\n\n\n        How to apply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Complete and send your application\n    \nApply through one of the University’s official agency partners, or via our online application system.\n\n\n\n        Apply now\nCheck your eligibility\n    \nBefore you begin, find the degree you wish to study and check you meet the academic entry requirements and English language requirements.\n\n\n\n        Entry requirements\nCheck your eligibility\n    \nBefore you begin, find the degree you wish to study and check you meet the academic entry requirements and English language requirements.\n\n\n\n        Entry requirements\nGather your relevant documents\n    \nEnsure you have all supporting documentation needed at the time of application to avoid delays.\n\n\n\n        How to apply\nGather your relevant documents\n    \nEnsure you have all supporting documentation needed at the time of application to avoid delays.\n\n\n\n        How to apply\nComplete and send your application\n    \nApply through one of the University’s official agency partners, or via our online application system.\n\n\n\n        Apply now\nComplete and send your application\n    \nApply through one of the University’s official agency partners, or via our online application system.\n\n\n\n        Apply now\nPlease note that a non-refundable application fee of AUD$150 applies for every application submitted to Adelaide University.\nFAQs\nExplore answers to some of our most frequently asked questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen can I apply to study at Adelaide University as a domestic student? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplications for Australian students to study at Adelaide University will open in August 2025. Applications will be via SATAC for most undergraduate and postgraduate coursework programs. \nApplications to study a 100% online degree will open in July 2025 via a direct application process. \nIn the meantime, you could start your studies at UniSA or the University of Adelaide in 2025 and continue on to Adelaide University in 2026.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat campuses and facilities does Adelaide University have?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdelaide University is South Australia’s largest university with seven campuses across the state.

geotechnics, transportation, water resource management, consulting, project management, and more.   \nYou could design earthquake-resistant buildings, improving safety for people living in areas prone to frequent seismic activity. Maybe you’ll facilitate a city’s transition to 100% renewable energy through the development of offshore wind farms, solar energy parks, or hydroelectric dams.   \nNo matter your career goals, there’s a path for you. You could work in a wide range of sectors including:    \nConstruction  Transportation   Water resources  Environmental engineering  Geotechnical engineering  Structural engineering  Urban planning and development.  \n Industry trends \nAdoption of smart technologies including building information modelling (BIM), Internet of Things (IoT) devices, digital twins and application of artificial intelligence and machine learning are driving digital transformation in the civil engineering sector. These technologies are being utilised to enable more sustainable, efficient and resilient infrastructure development. Civil engineers with the expertise to leverage these technologies are in high demand by employers. \nGlobally and in Australia, there is an engineering skills shortage. Demand for qualified engineers across all sectors continues to outstrip supply (Engineers Australia, 2023).  \n Major public infrastructure spend is projected to reach $230 billion by 2027 in Australia alone. This, combined with a projected shortfall of 229,000 full-time infrastructure workers, makes civil engineers the most in demand engineering specialist by industry (Infrastructure Australia, 2023).  \nAccreditation\nThis program is currently undergoing assessment for accreditation by Engineers Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReady to apply?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Check your eligibility\n    \nBefore you begin, find the degree you wish to study and check you meet the academic entry requirements and English language requirements.\n\n\n\n        Entry requirements \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Gather your relevant documents\n    \nEnsure you have all supporting documentation needed at the time of application to avoid delays.\n\n\n\n        How to apply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Complete and send your application\n    \nApply through one of the University’s official agency partners, or via our online application system.\n\n\n\n        Apply now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that a non-refundable application fee of AUD$150 applies for every application submitted to Adelaide University.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to apply\n\nApplications for international students are open now, to begin your studies in 2026.\nApply through one of the University’s official Education Agents, or via our International Application System.\nFind an Education Agent\nDepending on your country of citizenship, you may be required to apply through one of our Education Agents.\n\n\n\n                                        Find an education agent in your country\n                                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAQs\nExplore answers to some of our most frequently asked questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen can I apply to study at Adelaide University as a domestic student? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplications for Australian students to study at Adelaide University will open in August 2025. Applications will be via SATAC for most undergraduate and postgraduate coursework programs. \nApplications to study a 100% online degree will open in July 2025 via a direct application process. \nIn the meantime, you could start your studies at UniSA or the University of Adelaide in 2025 and continue on to Adelaide University in 2026.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat campuses and facilities does Adelaide University have?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdelaide University is South Australia’s largest university with seven campuses across the state.

covering construction, geotechnics, transportation, water resource management, consulting, project management, and more.   \nYou could design earthquake-resistant buildings, improving safety for people living in areas prone to frequent seismic activity. Maybe you’ll facilitate a city’s transition to 100% renewable energy through the development of offshore wind farms, solar energy parks, or hydroelectric dams.   \nNo matter your career goals, there’s a path for you. You could work in a wide range of sectors including:    \nConstruction  Transportation   Water resources  Environmental engineering  Geotechnical engineering  Structural engineering  Urban planning and development.  \n Industry trends \nAdoption of smart technologies including building information modelling (BIM), Internet of Things (IoT) devices, digital twins and application of artificial intelligence and machine learning are driving digital transformation in the civil engineering sector. These technologies are being utilised to enable more sustainable, efficient and resilient infrastructure development. Civil engineers with the expertise to leverage these technologies are in high demand by employers. \nGlobally and in Australia, there is an engineering skills shortage. Demand for qualified engineers across all sectors continues to outstrip supply (Engineers Australia, 2023).  \n Major public infrastructure spend is projected to reach $230 billion by 2027 in Australia alone. This, combined with a projected shortfall of 229,000 full-time infrastructure workers, makes civil engineers the most in demand engineering specialist by industry (Infrastructure Australia, 2023).  \nAccreditation\nThis program is currently undergoing assessment for accreditation by Engineers Australia.\nCheck your eligibility\n    \nBefore you begin, find the degree you wish to study and check you meet the academic entry requirements and English language requirements.\n\n\n\n        Entry requirements \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Gather your relevant documents\n    \nEnsure you have all supporting documentation needed at the time of application to avoid delays.\n\n\n\n        How to apply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Complete and send your application\n    \nApply through one of the University’s official agency partners, or via our online application system.\n\n\n\n        Apply now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that a non-refundable application fee of AUD$150 applies for every application submitted to Adelaide University.\nCheck your eligibility\n    \nBefore you begin, find the degree you wish to study and check you meet the academic entry requirements and English language requirements.\n\n\n\n        Entry requirements \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Gather your relevant documents\n    \nEnsure you have all supporting documentation needed at the time of application to avoid delays.\n\n\n\n        How to apply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Complete and send your application\n    \nApply through one of the University’s official agency partners, or via our online application system.\n\n\n\n        Apply now\nCheck your eligibility\n    \nBefore you begin, find the degree you wish to study and check you meet the academic entry requirements and English language requirements.\n\n\n\n        Entry requirements \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Gather your relevant documents\n    \nEnsure you have all supporting documentation needed at the time of application to avoid delays.\n\n\n\n        How to apply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Complete and send your application\n    \nApply through one of the University’s official agency partners, or via our online application system.\n\n\n\n        Apply now\nCheck your eligibility\n    \nBefore you begin, find the degree you wish to study and check you meet the academic entry requirements and English language requirements.\n\n\n\n        Entry requirements\nCheck your eligibility\n    \nBefore you begin, find the degree you wish to study and check you meet the academic entry requirements and English language requirements.\n\n\n\n        Entry requirements\nGather your relevant documents\n    \nEnsure you have all supporting documentation needed at the time of application to avoid delays.\n\n\n\n        How to apply\nGather your relevant documents\n    \nEnsure you have all supporting documentation needed at the time of application to avoid delays.\n\n\n\n        How to apply\nComplete and send your application\n    \nApply through one of the University’s official agency partners, or via our online application system.\n\n\n\n        Apply now\nComplete and send your application\n    \nApply through one of the University’s official agency partners, or via our online application system.\n\n\n\n        Apply now\nPlease note that a non-refundable application fee of AUD$150 applies for every application submitted to Adelaide University.\nFAQs\nExplore answers to some of our most frequently asked questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen can I apply to study at Adelaide University as a domestic student? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplications for Australian students to study at Adelaide University will open in August 2025. Applications will be via SATAC for most undergraduate and postgraduate coursework programs. \nApplications to study a 100% online degree will open in July 2025 via a direct application process. \nIn the meantime, you could start your studies at UniSA or the University of Adelaide in 2025 and continue on to Adelaide University in 2026.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat campuses and facilities does Adelaide University have?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdelaide University is South Australia’s largest university with seven campuses across the state.

covering construction, geotechnics, transportation, water resource management, consulting, project management, and more.   \nYou could design earthquake-resistant buildings, improving safety for people living in areas prone to frequent seismic activity. Maybe you’ll facilitate a city’s transition to 100% renewable energy through the development of offshore wind farms, solar energy parks, or hydroelectric dams.   \nNo matter your career goals, there’s a path for you. You could work in a wide range of sectors including:    \nConstruction  Transportation   Water resources  Environmental engineering  Geotechnical engineering  Structural engineering  Urban planning and development.  \n Industry trends \nAdoption of smart technologies including building information modelling (BIM), Internet of Things (IoT) devices, digital twins and application of artificial intelligence and machine learning are driving digital transformation in the civil engineering sector. These technologies are being utilised to enable more sustainable, efficient and resilient infrastructure development. Civil engineers with the expertise to leverage these technologies are in high demand by employers. \nGlobally and in Australia, there is an engineering skills shortage.

This, combined with a projected shortfall of 229,000 full-time infrastructure workers, makes civil engineers the most in demand engineering specialist by industry (Infrastructure Australia, 2023).  \nAccreditation\nThis program is currently undergoing assessment for accreditation by Engineers Australia.\nCheck your eligibility\n    \nBefore you begin, find the degree you wish to study and check you meet the academic entry requirements and English language requirements.\n\n\n\n        Entry requirements \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Gather your relevant documents\n    \nEnsure you have all supporting documentation needed at the time of application to avoid delays.\n\n\n\n        How to apply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Complete and send your application\n    \nApply through one of the University’s official agency partners, or via our online application system.\n\n\n\n        Apply now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that a non-refundable application fee of AUD$150 applies for every application submitted to Adelaide University.\nCheck your eligibility\n    \nBefore you begin, find the degree you wish to study and check you meet the academic entry requirements and English language requirements.\n\n\n\n        Entry requirements \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Gather your relevant documents\n    \nEnsure you have all supporting documentation needed at the time of application to avoid delays.\n\n\n\n        How to apply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Complete and send your application\n    \nApply through one of the University’s official agency partners, or via our online application system.\n\n\n\n        Apply now\nCheck your eligibility\n    \nBefore you begin, find the degree you wish to study and check you meet the academic entry requirements and English language requirements.\n\n\n\n        Entry requirements \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Gather your relevant documents\n    \nEnsure you have all supporting documentation needed at the time of application to avoid delays.\n\n\n\n        How to apply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Complete and send your application\n    \nApply through one of the University’s official agency partners, or via our online application system.\n\n\n\n        Apply now\nCheck your eligibility\n    \nBefore you begin, find the degree you wish to study and check you meet the academic entry requirements and English language requirements.\n\n\n\n        Entry requirements\nCheck your eligibility\n    \nBefore you begin, find the degree you wish to study and check you meet the academic entry requirements and English language requirements.\n\n\n\n        Entry requirements\nGather your relevant documents\n    \nEnsure you have all supporting documentation needed at the time of application to avoid delays.\n\n\n\n        How to apply\nGather your relevant documents\n    \nEnsure you have all supporting documentation needed at the time of application to avoid delays.\n\n\n\n        How to apply\nComplete and send your application\n    \nApply through one of the University’s official agency partners, or via our online application system.\n\n\n\n        Apply now\nComplete and send your application\n    \nApply through one of the University’s official agency partners, or via our online application system.\n\n\n\n        Apply now\nPlease note that a non-refundable application fee of AUD$150 applies for every application submitted to Adelaide University.\nFAQs\nExplore answers to some of our most frequently asked questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen can I apply to study at Adelaide University as a domestic student? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplications for Australian students to study at Adelaide University will open in August 2025. Applications will be via SATAC for most undergraduate and postgraduate coursework programs. \nApplications to study a 100% online degree will open in July 2025 via a direct application process. \nIn the meantime, you could start your studies at UniSA or the University of Adelaide in 2025 and continue on to Adelaide University in 2026.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat campuses and facilities does Adelaide University have?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdelaide University is South Australia’s largest university with seven campuses across the state.

This immersive experience reinforces theoretical knowledge with the practical application of engineering concepts, tools, and practices. The course focuses on learners critically reviewing their engagement with professional practice, which includes in-curricular, extra-curricular, and in-industry experiences, and how these have helped them develop and apply the Engineers Australia Competencies of a professional engineer. It links academic learning with life and industry experiences, deepening understanding of engineering challenges and solutions, and prepares learners to become professional engineers.\n• Demonstrate the ability to perform engineering tasks under supervision using appropriate methods, tools, and techniques across areas such as operations, facilities, and design, and demonstrate meeting the compliance requirements of the engagement with professional practice\n• Demonstrate professional conduct and communication skills, and the ability to work both autonomously and within a team, adapting to leadership roles as necessary and contributing effectively to team dynamics\n• Analyse and articulate the broad range of competencies required of a professional engineer, encompassing both technical and professional skills\n• Analyse and discuss the roles and responsibilities of engineers and managers within an organisation, including the structure, purpose, and operations of an engineering enterprise. and how engineers interact with internal and external stakeholders\n• Reflect on the influence of organisational culture on workplace functionality, considering aspects such as ethics, diversity, inclusivity and the integration of First Nations considerations, alongside the impact of the external environment on the performance of an engineering enterprise\n• Critically review professional conduct, reflect on professional development and the development of Engineers Australia Stage 1 Competencies at the professional engineer level, and assess ethical behaviours and decision-making in engineering practices\n[GRID_TABLE]\nMasters Professional Engineer Engagement with Professional Practice\n    \n\n\n\nPostgraduate | 2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse information\n\n\n\n\nCurrent student enquiry\n\n\n\n\n\nFuture student enquiry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArea/Catalogue\n\nENGI 5901\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse ID\n\n202128\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel of study\n\nPostgraduate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnit value\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse level\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInbound study abroad and exchange\nMore info\n\n\n\nInbound study abroad and exchange\n\n\n\nThe fee you pay will depend on the number and type of courses you study.\n\n\n\n\n\nYes\nDiscipline group B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity-wide elective course\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSingle course enrolment\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n\n                        Course data is interim and subject to change\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Course overview\n                \n\nThe aim of this course is to provide learners with direct exposure to the engineering field through structured, real-world engagements.

The minimum English language requirement for entry to an Adelaide University undergraduate program is an International English Language Testing System (IELTS) Academic overall score of 6.0 or equivalent. However, English language entry requirements are degree specific, and some degrees have higher English language requirements. This means the exact requirement will depend upon the degree you are applying to. Please visit the degree page for more information.\nYou can demonstrate your level of English language proficiency by providing the results of an accepted English language test (e.g. IELTS, PTE), taken within the last two years prior to admission. In some cases, you can also meet minimum language requirements using your previous academic qualifications (e.g. a Diploma completed in Australia) or through practical application of your English skills in a professional environment. Where previous study/work experience was conducted in English, the application must be accompanied by certified documentation from the educational institution/employer certifying that the language of instruction/employment was English.\nIf you don’t meet the minimum English language requirements, you can still apply for a program and if you meet the academic eligibility requirements for admission, we can send you a conditional offer packaged with an English language preparatory program from our English Language Centre.\nProof of English language proficiency, in addition to the academic entry requirements, does not guarantee a place at Adelaide University. Applications are considered on an individual basis and selection is competitive.\nFor a comprehensive list of all English language tests accepted by Adelaide University, please visit the English language proficiency page.\nThe Genuine Student (GS) requirement is an Australian Government integrity measure that applies to all student visa applicants. It considers whether the individual circumstances of a student indicate that their intention is to stay in Australia specifically for study.\nAll applicants for a student visa must be a genuine applicant for entry. They must stay as a student and be able to show an understanding that studying in Australia is the primary reason of their student visa. The GS requirement is intended to include students who, after studying in Australia, develop skills Australia needs and who then go on to apply for permanent residence.\nYour offer may include a condition requiring satisfaction of Adelaide University’s Genuine Student requirement. We will undertake further checks of your application and you may be asked to book and complete an interview as part of this process.\nAdelaide University must also be satisfied that you are able to financially support yourself and your accompanying family (if you have dependants) while you are studying. This means that you must be able to meet the cost of tuition fees and your living expenses, and that you understand that you will not be able to ask the University to waive your tuition fees, or pay any of your costs while you are living in Australia.\nView non-tuition fees\n• Prerequisites\n• Assumed knowledge.\n• A completed bachelor degree from a recognised higher education institution or equivalent; or\n• A completed graduate diploma from a recognised higher education institution; or\n• A completed graduate certificate from a recognised higher education institution.\n[GRID_TABLE]\nInternational entry requirements\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow menu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntry requirements for international students\nThe following information provides a general overview of the international entry requirements, English language requirements, Genuine Student requirements and financial capacity requirements that must be satisfied for entry into one of our undergraduate or postgraduate degrees. \nPlease note these provide a general guide only and should be read in conjunction with the specific entry requirement information for your chosen degree.\n\n\n\n\nFind your degree\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcademic entry requirements \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUndergraduate degree programs\n\nIn alignment with the Admissions Policy and Procedure, applicants are required to meet one of the following criteria with a competitive result and demonstrate that they fulfil any prerequisite requirements and essential requirements for admission: \nRecent secondary education \nCompletion of a secondary education qualification equivalent to SACE, such as an interstate year 12 or international qualification. \nHigher education study \nSuccessful completion of at least six months full-time study (or equivalent part-time) of a bachelor program (Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF) level 7), or higher, at a recognised higher education institution. \nOverseas qualifications considered by Adelaide University as equivalent to the above Australian qualifications may be accepted however English language requirements will also apply. \nVocational Education and Training (VET) \nCompletion of an award from a registered training organisation (RTO) at Certificate IV (Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF) level 4), or higher. \nAnd the following essential program requirements for Admission: \n\nPrerequisites  Assumed knowledge. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nPostgraduate degree programs\n\nPostgraduate applicants are required to have one of the following: \nA completed bachelor degree from a recognised higher education institution or equivalent; orA completed graduate diploma from a recognised higher education institution; orA completed graduate certificate from a recognised higher education institution. \nOverseas qualifications considered by Adelaide University as equivalent to the above Australian qualifications may be accepted however English language requirements will also apply.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnglish language proficiency\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo be admitted to a coursework program at Adelaide University, International students from non-English speaking backgrounds must meet our minimum English language requirements.

The minimum English language requirement for entry to an Adelaide University undergraduate program is an International English Language Testing System (IELTS) Academic overall score of 6.0 or equivalent. However, English language entry requirements are degree specific, and some degrees have higher English language requirements. This means the exact requirement will depend upon the degree you are applying to. Please visit the degree page for more information. \nYou can demonstrate your level of English language proficiency by providing the results of an accepted English language test (e.g. IELTS, PTE), taken within the last two years prior to admission. In some cases, you can also meet minimum language requirements using your previous academic qualifications (e.g. a Diploma completed in Australia) or through practical application of your English skills in a professional environment. Where previous study/work experience was conducted in English, the application must be accompanied by certified documentation from the educational institution/employer certifying that the language of instruction/employment was English.  \nIf you don’t meet the minimum English language requirements, you can still apply for a program and if you meet the academic eligibility requirements for admission, we can send you a conditional offer packaged with an English language preparatory program from our English Language Centre.\nProof of English language proficiency, in addition to the academic entry requirements, does not guarantee a place at Adelaide University. Applications are considered on an individual basis and selection is competitive.\nMore information   \nFor a comprehensive list of all English language tests accepted by Adelaide University, please visit the English language proficiency page.\n[CARD]\nThe Genuine Student (GS) requirement is an Australian Government integrity measure that applies to all student visa applicants. It considers whether the individual circumstances of a student indicate that their intention is to stay in Australia specifically for study. \nAll applicants for a student visa must be a genuine applicant for entry. They must stay as a student and be able to show an understanding that studying in Australia is the primary reason of their student visa. The GS requirement is intended to include students who, after studying in Australia, develop skills Australia needs and who then go on to apply for permanent residence. \nYour offer may include a condition requiring satisfaction of Adelaide University’s Genuine Student requirement. We will undertake further checks of your application and you may be asked to book and complete an interview as part of this process.\n[CARD]\nAdelaide University must also be satisfied that you are able to financially support yourself and your accompanying family (if you have dependants) while you are studying. This means that you must be able to meet the cost of tuition fees and your living expenses, and that you understand that you will not be able to ask the University to waive your tuition fees, or pay any of your costs while you are living in Australia.\nView non-tuition fees",
