It is intended for graduates who wish to gain advanced engineering skills and stay at the forefront of developments in the structural engineering field.\nThis is a unique one-year full-time MSc programme focused on industry-relevant skills, with the opportunity to gain specialist knowledge via one of the two curated pathways, ‘Composite Materials and Sustainable Design’ and ‘Asset Management and Digital Transformation’, which are carefully designed to adapt you to the changing requirements of the future structural/civil engineer as highlighted by professional bodies like the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) and the Institution of Structural Engineers (IStructE).\nYou will learn from world-leading experts and benefit from state-of-the-art research facilities, including the Heavy and Light Structures Lab, the Bristol Composites Institute Lab, and the Soil-Foundation-Structure-Interaction Lab.\nYou will gain advanced skills in construction materials, analysis, and civil infrastructure design with the core units of the MSc programme. With the pathway ‘Composite Materials and Sustainable Design’, you will develop specialist knowledge in new materials like fibre-reinforced polymers, structural retrofitting, and sustainability criteria in the design process. With the pathway ‘Asset Management and Digital Transformation’, you will specialise in asset and data management in civil infrastructure using systems-level thinking and mathematical and sustainability approaches.\nYou will develop knowledge of practical civil engineering design and learn from invited guest lecturers from industry and academia. Two additional unique features of this MSc programme are (i) a field trip that will enhance your learning in construction procedures and manufacturing workflows and (ii) a summer design project that simulates real-life conditions in an engineering company, working with academic and industrial supervisors to strengthen the skills necessary for a successful career in the industry.\nHear directly from an academic giving you a deeper insight into this programme.\nThe MSc course is a 12-month full-time programme with subject areas relevant to structural/civil engineering and emerging technologies and materials in the profession's future. A strong set of core engineering units will provide a common platform of underpinning skills and knowledge at a postgraduate level in advanced structural analysis, including finite element methodologies and dynamic loadings like earthquakes, and advanced structural materials and design. You will benefit from a series of seminars, as part of the Research and Professional Skills unit, learning the most recent advances in structural engineering from distinguished invited academic and industry experts.\nYou will select one of the two curated pathways, ‘Composite Materials and Sustainable Design’ or ‘Asset Management and Digital Transformation’, to gain specialisation in ‘new’ materials and sustainable design or in systems thinking approach and digital tools, respectively. Depending on your optional units, you may design and retrofit civil engineering structures like bridges with composite materials, create a project brief and assess solutions against sustainability criteria, debate state-of-the-art digital technologies for the delivery of integrated infrastructure and asset health monitoring, use mathematical modelling towards the achievement of UN sustainable development goals.\nAs part of your programme, you are also required to attend a field trip within the UK to visit construction and manufacturing sites.\nHaving successfully completed the taught component, you will develop a RIBA (Royal Institute of British Architects) stage 2 project, working in groups and independently, to be submitted at the end of the academic year.\nVisit our programme catalogue for full details of the structure and unit content.\nThe University of Bristol is ranked fifth for research in the UK (Times Higher Education).\n94% of our research assessed as world-leading or internationally excellent.\nYou will typically need an upper second-class honours degree or an international equivalent in:\nOther Engineering subjects will also be considered on a case-by-case basis.\nWe will also consider other non-Engineering degree subjects if you have at least one of the following:\nIf this is the case, please include your CV (curriculum vitae / résumé) when you apply, showing details of your relevant qualifications.\nSee international equivalent qualifications on the International Office website.\nRead the programme admissions statement for important information on entry requirements, the application process and supporting documents required.\nIf English is not your first language, you will need to reach the requirements outlined in our profile level E.\nFurther information about English language requirements and profile levels.\nFees are subject to an annual review. For programmes that last longer than one year, please budget for up to an 8% increase in fees each year.\nMore about tuition fees, living costs and financial support.\nUniversity of Bristol students and graduates can benefit from a 25% reduction in tuition fees for postgraduate study. Check your eligibility for an alumni discount.\nFees for the field trip are included in the postgraduate-taught fees. Fees are subject to an annual review.\nFurther information on funding for prospective UK and international postgraduate students.\nAs a graduate of the MSc in Structural Engineering, you will be better equipped to tackle challenging engineering problems with a holistic approach and make a difference within the sector. You can find yourself working for engineering design and construction firms in the UK or worldwide or, alternatively, for non-governmental organisations in the field of sustainability. You will also be equipped with unique skills that will support you in roles in the sector of composites engineering, data management, digitalisation, finance, and decision-making. Graduates may also choose to pursue a career in academia and expand their knowledge in an exciting topic of their interest.\nWhatever you choose, you will develop a range of transferable skills, such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and teamwork, and you will have a number of professional contacts to draw on.\nApply via our online application system.

Why is it so important?\n[HEADING] How can structural engineering have a positive impact on people and planet?\n[HEADING] What recent engineering breakthroughs or trends do you find promising or exciting?\n[HEADING] Tell us about your personal journey into engineering?\n[HEADING] Can you tell us some more about the new MSc?\n[HEADING] Are there any practical elements to the course?\n[HEADING] What kind of career could graduates go into after studying this programme?\n[HEADING] Your final piece of advice for aspiring sustainable engineers?\n[HEADING] Useful links\nStructural Engineers have a vital role to play in the future of the built environment. They translate vision into reality, providing safe, sustainable and cost-effective solutions that, in some cases, can transform lives and communities.\nEleni Toumpanaki’s love for engineering began with her exploring the foundations of her childhood home. Here, she reflects on the importance of structural engineering, the development of new materials and technologies and offers an insight into our new MSc in Structural Engineering.\nWhat I find truly fascinating in structural engineering is the creative design process and the co-design approach with various stakeholders, including architects and mechanical engineers. We can make the impossible possible by realising architects’ aspirations and finding optimum, realistic and cost-effective solutions while ensuring that what is delivered is structurally safe, resilient, and sustainable.\nAs a Structural Engineer, you might be involved in designing the tallest skyscraper or the longest bridge, tackling grand challenges. Yet, you can equally contribute by working on a timber bridge in a local community in Rwanda, enhancing access to water resources and improving the lives of residents. While our focus as engineers often gravitates towards technical details, it’s essential to recognise the social and environmental effects of our profession.\nThe structural and civil engineering sectors can transform lives in many ways. For example, there are whole-house retrofit projects aimed at improving the living standards of occupants and addressing fuel poverty, as well as providing seismic retrofit solutions using local materials and resources in schools in Nepal to enhance seismic safety and resilience. Then there are large-scale projects, such as the Panama Canal, which can transform economies while reducing risks and time associated with shipping trade.\nMeanwhile, adopting new technologies, like 3D-printed concrete houses, can further advance the industry by utilising high-performance, efficient materials through modern construction methods.\nMy own research focuses on using timber from sustainably managed forests and implementing regenerative design approaches with biobased local resources in construction, ensuring environmental and social responsibility for future generations.\nProfessional bodies like the Institution of Civil Engineers and the Institution of Structural Engineers have highlighted emerging trends that will disrupt the structural engineering sector. These are high-performance and sustainable materials, adopting a systems-level thinking approach, given the increasing complexity of engineering projects and data management, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of things\nStructural engineers should be equipped with the skills to adapt to the requirements of a changing world. However, core engineering principles of problem-solving skills, creative and critical thinking, and developing solutions from first principles – beyond codified approaches- are timeless. Bristol’s new MSc in Structural Engineering is designed with the current and future needs of the structural engineering sector in mind, encompassing all these aspects of advanced engineering skills.\nAs a kid, I enjoyed building things (e.g. Lego), breaking things apart to see how they work, or attempting to fix things (e.g. intercom) in most cases successfully. The first seeds of my interest in structural engineering were planted when I observed the construction of our home, from the excavation of the foundations to the casting of the concrete slabs. You could say that I had my first site visit as a prospective structural engineer at the age of 14!\nI’m now a Senior Lecturer in Civil Engineering at the University of Bristol, where I have been since November 2019. I hold a Diploma in Civil Engineering from the National Technical University of Athens and an MSc in Steel Design and Sustainable Development from Imperial College London. I’ve spent most of my career in academia, focusing on both teaching and research. I dedicated six years as a researcher at the University of Cambridge and two years as a Structural Engineer at Foster + Partners in London.\nI really like Bristol because the size of the city is manageable and not as chaotic as London. You can enjoy a nice, quiet walk in Clifton or by the Harbourside. You can easily commute on foot and experience the vibrant life of a big city. Plus, the University of Bristol is among the best in the country for both teaching and research in civil engineering sector.\nI chose research engineering paths because I could better satisfy my engineering curiosity. It is like a detective job – trying to find answers and solutions to problems and interpreting experimental results.\nMy research focuses on sustainable construction materials, particularly timber, with an emphasis on durability and structural resilience. I enjoy teaching and engaging with students, prompting them to challenge their thinking and inspiring them to think creatively. It’s incredibly rewarding to see the students’ progress. You plant the seeds, and in a few years, you see them succeeding as Structural Engineers, delivering talks at the University of Bristol, and sharing their work experiences and insights with the next generation.\nWe’ve designed this programme to make sure that there’s a degree of interdisciplinary, offering transferrable skills and flexibility in career paths. So, when you apply, you can choose from two pathways depending on the area you want to specialise in, either Composite Materials and Sustainable Design or Asset Management and Digital Transformation.\nOne of the key features of this programme is the final design project, which, unlike other MSc programmes, is delivered instead of a research dissertation. It’s intended to help students develop industry-relevant skills by working on a real-world engineering project (e.g. a footbridge in London).\nStudents will also be able to showcase their skills via a group poster session, lab report, final design report and individual coursework where they can work independently to develop one aspect of their project.\nWe also ask students to submit a Personal Development Plan to help them understand future chartership requirements.\nAs well as from the final design project, which simulates workflows in a design office, there’s also a the field trip, which offers the opportunity to gain hands-on learning in construction and opportunities to gain lab experience and exposure to our state-of-the-art facilities.\n\nFor example, you could work on our 3m x 3m shaking table at the Earthquake lab as part of the lab report in the Advanced Structural Analysis unit. You’d test a scaled-down version of a three-storey building under various seismic excitations, record accelerations, and evaluate its performance.\nThe summer group design project also has a group lab component, where you will develop an understanding of how research is embedded in the design and the principles of the performance design approach.\nMSc graduates can pursue careers in structural, civil, and construction engineering. Depending on the chosen pathway and optional units, students will also have the opportunity to broaden their skills in the design and construction of composite materials or mathematical modelling for engineering applications.\nEngineering is an exciting job for problem solvers. Think out of the box! You are shaping the next generation of engineers, and your actions can lead the way to a more sustainable future in construction.\n*The course information and statements contained within this blog are correct at time of publication.\n• Learn more about MSc Structural Engineering\n• More on the University of Bristol’s environmental research\n[CARD]\nUseful links\n\nLearn more about MSc Structural Engineering\nMore on the University of Bristol’s environmental research",
