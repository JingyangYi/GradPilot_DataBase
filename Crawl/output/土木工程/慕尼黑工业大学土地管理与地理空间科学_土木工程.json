Students of the Master’s program learn to analyze conflicting requirements and develop solutions for sustainable land use.\nCourse Homepage\nWinter semester: 01.01. – 31.05.\nIncreasing urbanization, growing demand for land in agriculture, and precarious land tenure, particularly in developing countries, highlight the urgent need for functional land management systems. Students of the English-taught Master’s degree program in Land Management and Geospatial Science (M.Sc.) learn to analyze conflicting requirements and develop solutions for socially, ecologically, and economically sustainable land use.\nThe program focuses on various aspects of the use of land, water, and forests, especially in developing countries. It teaches concepts, theories, and techniques of land management as well as geosciences. Students deal with the analysis and development of responsible land management systems, with the interactions between urban and rural areas, with questions of land valuation, land taxation, land allocation, and land development in to establish a system of adequate land management and secure land tenure. They have the opportunity to specialize in the areas of Systems of Land Rights and Land Use, Systems of Geospatial Engineering for Land, Water and Forestry Management, or Systems of Planning, Policy and Governance.\nGraduates of the degree program are specialists in the development of fair and sustainable land use systems. They are able to apply land and space-related concepts with theoretical knowledge, socio-economic and legal competence, and in a situation-specific manner in order to meet global challenges resulting from insecure ownership, shifts in land use, and volatile social and ecological conditions. This makes them particularly well qualified for work in international development cooperation organizations, but also for continuing their scientific work within the framework of a dissertation.\nFor a comprehensive description of the program, please refer to the degree program documentation:\nThe degree program comprises 4 semesters and 120 CP in total. Within the first two semesters the students gain skills in land management sciences, in geospatial engineering sciences and in policy, governance, management and research sciences. In the third semester the students choose one of three areas of concentration (1. Land management skills, 2. Usage of geospatial methods and techniques, and 3. Political and organizational aspects of land and geospatial interventions) enabling students to select combinations of modules based on their specific interests, which also offers a good opportunity for international mobility, and finalize their studies in the fourth semester in writing their master’s thesis.\nRequired language skills for admission:\nYou need sufficient English language skills if you wish to apply for this program. Evidence of your language proficiency has to be submitted before the end of the application deadline. Learn more about recognized certificates and other ways to prove your English language skills.\nThis evidence of your language proficiency confirms that you comply with the minimum language requirements for admission to the program. Depending on the program and your individual background, it may be necessary for you to keep working on your language skills during your studies. Be sure to take a look at the services of our Language Center.\nLanguage of instruction:\nThe language of instruction for this program is English.\nMinimum requirements to apply for a Master's program at TUM are a recognized undergraduate degree (e.g. a bachelor’s) and the successful completion of the aptitude assessment procedure. Aptitude assessment allows the TUM school or department to which you are applying the opportunity to evaluate your individual talents and motivation for study.\nDuring the application period, you must apply through the TUMonline application portal and upload your application documents.\nHere you will find detailed information on the requirements for the documents you need to upload for application and admission to TUM.\nGenerally, applicants with a qualification for postgraduate studies (e.g. a Bachelor’s) obtained outside of Germany must have their documents reviewed in advance through uni-assist (Preliminary Documentation).\nWe may require additional documents depending on your educational background and your country of origin. Complete the online application to receive a comprehensive list of the required documents.\nWe may require additional documents depending on the type of educational background you earned and your country of origin. After accepting an offer of admission in TUMonline, you will receive a list of documents you must submit to TUM in hardcopy for enrollment.\nApplication period for winter semester: 01.01. – 31.05.\nInformation about applying for a higher subject semester\nDuring the application period, you must apply through the TUMonline application portal and upload your application documents. Please be aware that we can only process your application if you upload all required documents within the application period.\nWe will review your application as soon as it is complete. Please check your TUMonline account regularly, to see if we have any queries to your documents or if you have to amend one or more documents.\nAfter receiving admission, you will see in TUMonline which documents you have to submit for enrollment, and in which form.\nWe recommend that you submit the documents for enrollment as soon as possible after receiving admission. If individual documents are not available by then, you can submit them up to 5 weeks after the start of the lecture period. You will, however, only be enrolled once we have received all documents.\nYou can check the status of your application at any time in your TUMonline account.\nThe program is aimed at applicants which are capable of handling complex problems in land matters which usually only tend to have customized and contextually relevant solutions. In addition, applicants should demonstrate good command of the English language, and should have good communication skills. Therefore, applicants are subject to aptitude assessment.\nIn the initial stages, the grades obtained by the applicant during the bachelor's program, as well as the provided written documents, will be evaluated using a point system. Depending on the amount of points accumulated, applicants are either rejected or provisionally admitted subject to the qualification assessment of the second stage. The interview represents the second stage of the procedure and helps determine whether the applicant is capable of successfully completing the desired course of study. One by one oral interviews are conducted in person or by telephone. The results of preliminary assessments and interviews leads to the ranking of candidates to be presented to a selection committee, consisting of the Dean of Studies, Program Director and Program Coordinator. It is the committee that determines who is finally accepted or rejected for admission.\nQuestions about application and admission\nstudium@tum.de  +49 89 289 22245  Arcisstr. 21, Room 0144\nContact hours\nGeneral Student Advising\nAppointments by arrangement in advance\nWalter Dachaga\nlmgs@bole.lrg.tum.de  +49 89 289 25789  Arcisstr. 21, 80333 München\n• Show convenient version of this site\n• Don't show this message again\n• Full Time\n• 4\n\t\t\t\tsemesters\n• 120 ECTS\n• Munich\n• Aptitude Assessment for Master\n• Winter Semester (October)\n• Student Fees:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t85.00 €\n• English\n• Degree program documentation for the Master’s program in Land Management and Geospatial Science (PDF)\n• Overwiew degree program structure\n• Information on exams\n• Information on studying abroad\n• General Academic and Examination Regulations\n• Academic and Examination Regulations\n• All regulations and legal framework concerning studies\n• Applying for a master’s program: Application, admission requirements and more\n• Important information about your application from the TUM school or department\n• Degree Certificate and Diploma or Subject and Grade Transcript of Studies to Date\n• Transcript of Records\n• Statement of purpose (Letter of Motivation)\n• Proof of English Language Proficiency\n• Complete and Current Résumé\n• Passport\n• Preliminary Documentation (VPD) if the qualification for graduate studies (e.g. a Bachelor’s) was obtained outside Germany)\n• Application for Enrollment (signed)\n• Degree Certificate and Diploma (authentic document)\n• Transcript of Records (authentic document)\n• Most Current Photo (as for ID)\n• Digital notification of your health insurance status from a German public health insurance provider (requested by applicant)\n• Aptitude Assessment for Master\n• Description of the aptitude assessment\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t(PDF 154 KB)\n[CARD]\nType of Study\n\t\t\n\nFull Time\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tStandard Duration of Studies\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\tsemesters\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tCredits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t120 ECTS\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tMain Locations\n\t\t\n\n\nMunich\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tApplication Period\n\t\t\nWinter semester: 01.01. – 31.05.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAdmission Category\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nAptitude Assessment for Master\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tStart of Degree Program\n\t\t\n\nWinter Semester (October)\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tCosts\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tStudent Fees:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t85.00 €\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n            Required Language Proficiency\n        \n\n\nEnglish\n[CARD]\nIncreasing urbanization, growing demand for land in agriculture, and precarious land tenure, particularly in developing countries, highlight the urgent need for functional land management systems.

To do this, you need a credit transfer report.\nIn any case, be sure to contact your departmental student academic advisor before applying to a higher subject semester (Fachsemester). You can find the respective contact person in the search field at the bottom of this page.\nThe recognition process depends on your previous course of study:\nIf you apply for a degree program at TUM and have already completed courses in an identical or related program, your previous study periods will be officially recognized and you will be automatically assigned to the corresponding semester at TUM. After enrolling, you must apply for the recognition of your previously earned credits at your department.\nIf you apply for a degree program at TUM and have already completed courses in another, non-related program, you can make an application to have these courses recognized. If courses or previously earned credits are recognized to a certain amount, you will be placed in a higher subject semester (Fachsemester) of the degree program at TUM.\nThe recognition of credits is defined by the Bavarian University Law and the General Academic and Examination Regulations of TUM.\nPeriods of study from identical or related degree programs will be officially recognized. This means that at TUM you will be enrolled in the semester corresponding your previous study times. After your enrollment at TUM, you additionally have to apply for the recognition of your previously earned credits at your school.\nCredits from other, non-related degree programs can only be recognized if there is no essential difference between the acquired learning outcomes and those required in your TUM degree program. This can only be assessed after an in-depth review at the school upon application.\nStudy periods from identical or related degree programs will be recognized automatically. At TUM you will be enrolled in the semester corresponding to your previous study times. After your enrollment, you additionally have to apply for the recognition of your previously earned credits at your school. Please make sure to contact your departmental academic student advisor early on! You can search for the corresponding contact in the right margin column under “Departmental Student Advising”.\nIf you apply for a degree program at TUM and have already completed courses in another, non-related program, there are two different application processes to a higher subject semester (Fachsemester): the upstream and the downstream process. Please check the list below for the relevant process concerning your application.\nThe upstream process starts with a mandatory advising session at the school before the online application. There, you will discuss your previously earned credits with a representative of the school. You fill in the application form to a higher subject semester (Fachsemester) during the advising session. With the signature of the school, the application form turns into a credit transfer report. You can then apply online, and submit the credit transfer report together with the other application documents.\nThe downstream process starts with you applying directly via TUMonline. You fill in the application for the credit transfer report yourself and upload it together with the module descriptions and the grading system (not necessary if the German grading system was used) as one PDF-document during the online application. The relevant school then processes your application and decides whether sufficient credits can be recognized to place you in a higher subject semester (Fachsemester). Please contact the responsible departmental student advisor in advance, who will also be able to tell you the application deadlines.\nImportant: The credit transfer report should not be confused with the official procedure for recognizing previously earned credits, which can only be initiated once you have actually enrolled. The credit transfer report is always preliminary (except for programs with restricted admission) and the result may be changed after the official recognition process.\nLearn more about the recognition of previously earned credits\nPlease note: If you need to provide a Preliminary Documentation (VPD) from uni-assist for your application, please still apply for it for the first subject semester (Fachsemester).\nIn this list you will see how your school handles the recognition of credits. Be sure to contact the departmental student academic advisor of your desired program in any case.\nPlease consult with the contact persons for M.Sc. Radiation Biology and M.Sc. Biomedical Neuroscience.\nStudents of Medicine can find all information on how to apply at www.tum.de/en/studies/application/medical-studies/medicine-clinical-work.\nYou will have to submit\nYou have to submit these documents to the Admissions and Enrollment Office by the end of the application deadline for the desired program to the school for application and admission, just like the rest of your application documents. Please contact the responsible departmental student advisors as early as possible; they will also be able to tell you the application deadlines.\nImportant: Enrollment at TUM in a higher subject semester (Fachsemester) is not possible without the credit transfer report! Make sure to contact your departmental student academic advisor early on.\nFor degree programs with restricted admission (numerus clausus), the credit transfer report has to be completed by the end of the application period, even if it is a downstream process. So please be sure to contact your school early on in order to allow for the review of your application to be completed in time. Also, for degree programs with restricted admission, the result of the credit transfer report is binding.\nApplications from the first subject semester (Fachsemester) to the second subject semester (Fachsemester) are not possible in all schools. Please be sure to contact your departmental student academic advisor in advance to find out whether applying from the first to the second subject semester is generally possible, and if so, which documents you need to supply.\nBe sure to check the rules concerning progress monitoring in the General Academic and Examination Regulations and the Academic and Examination Regulations of the desired degree program.\nThese define the amount of credits you have to have acquired at the end of a certain subject semester (Fachsemester).

This means that at TUM you will be enrolled in the semester corresponding your previous study times. After your enrollment at TUM, you additionally have to apply for the recognition of your previously earned credits at your school. \nCredits from other, non-related degree programs can only be recognized if there is no essential difference between the acquired learning outcomes and those required in your TUM degree program. This can only be assessed after an in-depth review at the school upon application.\n[CARD]\nStudy periods from identical or related degree programs will be recognized automatically. At TUM you will be enrolled in the semester corresponding to your previous study times. After your enrollment, you additionally have to apply for the recognition of your previously earned credits at your school. Please make sure to contact your departmental academic student advisor early on! You can search for the corresponding contact in the right margin column under “Departmental Student Advising”.\nIf you apply for a degree program at TUM and have already completed courses in another, non-related program, there are two different application processes to a higher subject semester (Fachsemester): the upstream and the downstream process. Please check the list below for the relevant process concerning your application. \nThe upstream process starts with a mandatory advising session at the school before the online application. There, you will discuss your previously earned credits with a representative of the school. You fill in the application form to a higher subject semester (Fachsemester) during the advising session. With the signature of the school, the application form turns into a credit transfer report. You can then apply online, and submit the credit transfer report together with the other application documents. \nThe downstream process starts with you applying directly via TUMonline. You fill in the application for the credit transfer report yourself and upload it together with the module descriptions and the grading system (not necessary if the German grading system was used) as one PDF-document during the online application. The relevant school then processes your application and decides whether sufficient credits can be recognized to place you in a higher subject semester (Fachsemester). Please contact the responsible departmental student advisor in advance, who will also be able to tell you the application deadlines.\nImportant: The credit transfer report should not be confused with the official procedure for recognizing previously earned credits, which can only be initiated once you have actually enrolled. The credit transfer report is always preliminary (except for programs with restricted admission) and the result may be changed after the official recognition process. \nLearn more about the recognition of previously earned credits\nPlease note: If you need to provide a Preliminary Documentation (VPD) from uni-assist for your application, please still apply for it for the first subject semester (Fachsemester).\n[CARD]\nIn this list you will see how your school handles the recognition of credits.

Yet, land administration systems and practices do not cater to the complexity of land issues, including urban sprawl, land tenure insecurity, and climate change.\nDeriving solutions to these challenges requires a combination of contextual insights, technical-methodological instruments, and communication skills to accelerate land rights documentation, land tenure security, and sustainable land use. It requires responsible governance of land tenure and fit-for-purpose land information systems to document people-land relationships in a politically, legally, and socio-culturally sensitive manner.\nThe Land Management and Geospatial Science program combines two inter-connected scientific domains: Land Management and Geospatial Science. The aim of the master’s program is to train land professionals who can apply land and spatial-related concepts and tools to analyze international contemporary land issues and have the executive soft skills to carry out land administration functions to solve these land issues.\nStudents explore land management from a multidisciplinary perspective, applying methods and techniques from geospatial engineering and land management sciences to evaluate and implement spatial development and land policy responsibly and sustainably.\nGraduates of the Land Management and Geospatial Science program are specialized generalists with a broad overview of land management and geospatial science topics and approaches. They work at the interface of politics and technology, applying existing land tools or designing new policies and interventions for documenting, administering, or protecting land tenure in specific socio-legal contexts. Their expertise is crucial in developing creative, innovative, and sustainable solutions to complex and contextual spatial problems. They also contribute their technical-methodological expertise to developing land and geospatial information systems that can capture, monitor, store, and query multi-dimensional information on land use, land tenure, and natural resource rights. Finally, they apply their interrelated geospatial, social, and legal skills to reconcile different and competing stakeholder interests in land.\nYou can find more information about the M.Sc.

      "content": "[HEADING] Master's Degree Programs at TUM\nTUM offers over 100 master’s degree programs from a variety of fields. Find out here what master’s programs there are and how to apply.\nMaster’s degree programs are graduate studies. That means, you have to complete an undergraduate degree to qualify, for example a bachelor’s degree program.\nDepending on the program, TUM awards the following master’s degrees: Master of Science (M.Sc.), Master of Arts (M.A.), Master of Business Administration (MBA), Master of Education (M.Ed.) and Master of Science with honors (M.Sc. with honors). As a rule, students with master's degrees are entitled to pursue a doctorate.\nIf you have completed your studies outside of Germany and would now like to know what options you have with your degree with respect to master's degree programs in germany, the anabin-database can provide orientation.\nA master's program can build on an undergraduate degree or it can be used to pursue a new field of study. In either case, these are referred to as consecutive master’s programs. Other master’s programs are particularly aimed at prospective students with professional experience. These are referred to as continuing education master’s programs. Contact the Student Advisory Office to learn how the TUM bachelor's programs align with the TUM master's programs or visit Master’s Day, which takes place annually.\nView Master's Degree Programs at TUM\nConsecutive master’s programs are often structured on a bachelor's program of the same name. They are designed to deepen and expand the knowledge acquired during the undergraduate program. TUM offers at least one consecutive master's program for each bachelor's program.\nSome master's programs are not structured on the basis of specific bachelor's programs. Instead, they can be pursued by students who hold bachelor's degrees from a range of different fields. While these programs require certain fundamental knowledge, this can be acquired through various bachelor's programs.  Example: TUM graduates with a Bachelor's in mechanical engineering can apply for a Master's in aerospace, mechanical engineering or robotics, cognition, intelligence, to name a few.\nAs a rule, continuing education master’s programs require candidates to have at least one year of work experience. In some cases, the programs may be attended while holding gainful employment. Duration of studies varies accordingly. Special tuition fees also apply.  Example: Students with a Bachelor's or undergraduate degree in electrical engineering and information technology have the option of pursuing continuing education master's programs like an Executive MBA.\nTUM also offers double degree programs. Double degree programs give you the opportunity to receive a degree from both TUM and one of its partner universities.\nHere you will find further information on double degree programs.\nMaster degree programs are subject to a two-step aptitude assessment procedure. Once an application has been received, the first step involves evaluating the application documents based on a point system. Depending on the number of points accumulated, candidates are then immediately accepted, rejected or invited to a selection interview. Some programs also use a written test instead of the selection interview. Consult the Academic and Examination Regulations  of the desired program for further information regarding the required documentation and criteria.\nLecture period, lecture-free days, or enrollment periods – all semester dates and deadlines at a glance.\nFind answers to the most frequently asked questions.\nEverything you need to know about documents required for application\n+49 89 289 22245  Monday to Friday, 9:00 a.m. – 12:00 p.m.   studiumspam prevention@tum.de Please observe the e-mail etiquette.\nFind all the info on our services here.\nPersonal advising sessions with General Student Advising by appointment.\nCampus Munich, Arcisstraße 21, Room 0144, 80333 München\nMonday, Wednesday, Friday: 9 a.m. – 12 p.m.\nTuesday and Thursday, 1 p.m. – 4 p.m. (Student Information only)\n• Show convenient version of this site\n• Don't show this message again\n[CARD]\nDates and Deadlines\nDates and Deadlines\n\n\nLecture period, lecture-free days, or enrollment periods – all semester dates and deadlines at a glance.\n[CARD]\nDates and Deadlines\nDates and Deadlines\n[CARD]\nDates and Deadlines\n[CARD]\nLecture period, lecture-free days, or enrollment periods – all semester dates and deadlines at a glance.\n[CARD]\nFAQs about your studies at TUM\nFAQs about your studies at TUM\n\n\nFind answers to the most frequently asked questions.\n[CARD]\nFAQs about your studies at TUM\nFAQs about your studies at TUM\n[CARD]\nFAQs about your studies at TUM\n[CARD]\nFind answers to the most frequently asked questions.\n[CARD]\nGlossary of Documents\nGlossary of Documents\n\n\nEverything you need to know about documents required for application\n[CARD]\nGlossary of Documents\nGlossary of Documents\n[CARD]\nGlossary of Documents\n[CARD]\nEverything you need to know about documents required for application\n[CARD]\nStudent Advising and Information Services\nStudent Advising and Information Services\n\n\n +49 89 289 22245  Monday to Friday, 9:00 a.m. – 12:00 p.m.   studiumspam prevention@tum.de Please observe the e-mail etiquette.\nFind all the info on our services here.\nPersonal advising sessions with General Student Advising by appointment.\n[CARD]\nStudent Advising and Information Services\nStudent Advising and Information Services\n[CARD]\nStudent Advising and Information Services\n[CARD]\n+49 89 289 22245  Monday to Friday, 9:00 a.m. – 12:00 p.m.   studiumspam prevention@tum.de Please observe the e-mail etiquette.\nFind all the info on our services here.\nPersonal advising sessions with General Student Advising by appointment.\n[CARD]\nService Desk\nService Desk\n\n\n Campus Munich, Arcisstraße 21, Room 0144, 80333 München\nMonday, Wednesday, Friday: 9 a.m. – 12 p.m.\nTuesday and Thursday, 1 p.m. – 4 p.m. (Student Information only)\n[CARD]\nService Desk\nService Desk\n[CARD]\nService Desk\n[CARD]\nCampus Munich, Arcisstraße 21, Room 0144, 80333 München\nMonday, Wednesday, Friday: 9 a.m. – 12 p.m.\nTuesday and Thursday, 1 p.m. – 4 p.m. (Student Information only)",

On this page you'll find everything you need to know when it comes to proving your language skills.\nCourses at TUM are offered in two languages of instruction: German and English. There are degree programs in which all courses are offered either entirely in German or in English. In some degree programs, you can or must take courses or modules in both German and English. Depending on the degree program and the focus of your studies, you will therefore need different language skills.\nThe options listed here are sufficient to comply with the minimum language requirements needed for admission. Depending on the program and your individual background it may, however, be necessary for you to keep working on your language skills during your studies. Be sure to check out the services of our Language Center.\nFor information on what credentials you need to provide when applying for a specific degree program, please see our degree program pages.\nNot sure what to use as proof of your language skills when applying? Our Language Skill Navigator can help you narrow down your options.\nGood command of German is an important prerequisite to successfully complete your studies at TUM. Proof of sufficient German language skills must be submitted before the end of the application period for all degree programs whose language of instruction is German.\nApplicants holding a German university entrance qualification do not require verification of their German language skills. German citizens with an international higher education entrance qualification who have spent at least two school years at a German-speaking school may submit two annual school certificates of this school as proof of their German language proficiency.\nPlease also note the information on the requirements of the Standing Conference of the Ministers of Education in Germany (KMK) regarding proof of German language proficiency.

So please be sure the documents will be issued in time, i.e. before the application deadline. Additionally, the documents submitted must show the proportion of your entire degree program that was taught in German.\nPreliminary certificates, transcripts etc. are not sufficient. If the final graduation documents are not available in time, you need to submit a different proof of language proficiency.\nIf you have successfully passed the Advanced Placement Exam (AP) in German, please upload your AP scores as a PDF file under “Other language certificate recognized within the KMK ‘Framework for German Language Examinations for Study at German Universities’”.\nPlease note:\nAs a rule, proof of sufficient English language skills must be submitted before the end of the application period for all degree programs whose language of instruction is English.\nIn these cases, please upload valid proof of your english language skills to the online application form.

Please refer to the Academic and Examination Regulations of your degree program (FPSO) for specific details. Please also be aware of the Collective Amendment concerning the proof of English language proficiency (PDF, 143 KB)\nEnglish language proficiency may no longer be proven by school grades (e.g. in the Abitur). An exception may apply to individual Bachelor’s degree programs for which language skills verification is carried out as part of the aptitude assessment.\nFor Master's degree programs, English language proficiency cannot be proven by school grades in any case.\nYou can prove your English language skills through the language of instruction in your previous school or academic education – for example, completed a full secondary school education in English (secondary school leaving certificate must open up direct access to higher education in Germany) or if the language of instruction in a Bachelor’s or Master’s degree program was English – by submitting your transcript of records or your degree certificate as evidence. The language of instruction needs to have been English in at least 50% of the program.\nIf the language of instruction is not stated in these documents, you can submit an official confirmation issued by your prior university.\nFor some Master’s degree programs, a sufficient amount of credits acquired in English modules during your undergraduate studies is accepted as proof of your English language proficiency as well. The information whether this option is valid for a certain degree program and, if so, how many credits you need to have completed in English modules, can be found in the Academic and Examination Regulations of a degree program.\nIf this option is given for a certain degree program, you need to submit your transcript of records or your degree certificate as evidence, as well as the form for verification of English-language proficiency through English-language modules in the undergraduate degree program (PDF, 175 KB).\nFor some Master’s degree programs, for example at the TUM School of Computation, Information and Technology, it is also possible to prove your English-language proficiency by submitting an English-language Bachelor’s thesis. Please note that the thesis must already have been submitted and graded. The English title must be noted in the transcript as a passed credit requirement and the transcript must indicate that the thesis was written in English; otherwise, a separate certificate from the university stating the language of the bachelor's thesis must be submitted. If the Bachelor’s thesis has not yet been graded, it cannot be used as a proof of English language proficiency.\nSemesters spent in an exchange program or internship are not sufficient.\nIn the Bachelor’s degree programs\nEnglish language skills verification is carried out as part of the aptitude assessment.\nIn this process, it is assessed whether the language skills you have acquired at school are sufficient for your studies. For this purpose, proof of your English language skills as provided by your higher education entrance qualification (e.g. Abitur) is checked. Alternatively, the necessary language skills can be verified during the aptitude interview\nThe regulations for your degree program can be found in the corresponding Regulations on Aptitude Assessment.\nA GMAT with a score higher than 600 is accepted as proof of english skills for some master's programs offered by the TUM School of Management.

We will attempt to verify your PTE Academic certificate online.\n[CARD]\nYou can prove your English language skills through the language of instruction in your previous school or academic education – for example, completed a full secondary school education in English (secondary school leaving certificate must open up direct access to higher education in Germany) or if the language of instruction in a Bachelor’s or Master’s degree program was English – by submitting your transcript of records or your degree certificate as evidence. The language of instruction needs to have been English in at least 50% of the program.\nIf the language of instruction is not stated in these documents, you can submit an official confirmation issued by your prior university.\nFor some Master’s degree programs, a sufficient amount of credits acquired in English modules during your undergraduate studies is accepted as proof of your English language proficiency as well. The information whether this option is valid for a certain degree program and, if so, how many credits you need to have completed in English modules, can be found in the Academic and Examination Regulations of a degree program.\nIf this option is given for a certain degree program, you need to submit your transcript of records or your degree certificate as evidence, as well as the form for verification of English-language proficiency through English-language modules in the undergraduate degree program (PDF, 175 KB).\nFor some Master’s degree programs, for example at the TUM School of Computation, Information and Technology, it is also possible to prove your English-language proficiency by submitting an English-language Bachelor’s thesis. Please note that the thesis must already have been submitted and graded. The English title must be noted in the transcript as a passed credit requirement and the transcript must indicate that the thesis was written in English; otherwise, a separate certificate from the university stating the language of the bachelor's thesis must be submitted. If the Bachelor’s thesis has not yet been graded, it cannot be used as a proof of English language proficiency.\nSemesters spent in an exchange program or internship are not sufficient.\n[CARD]\nIn the Bachelor’s degree programs Aerospace Information Engineering Management and Data Science Management and Technology (at Munich Campus) Political Science Sustainable Management and Technology English language skills verification is carried out as part of the aptitude assessment.\nIn this process, it is assessed whether the language skills you have acquired at school are sufficient for your studies. For this purpose, proof of your English language skills as provided by your higher education entrance qualification (e.g. Abitur) is checked. Alternatively, the necessary language skills can be verified during the aptitude interview\nThe regulations for your degree program can be found in the corresponding Regulations on Aptitude Assessment.\n[CARD]\nA GMAT with a score higher than 600 is accepted as proof of english skills for some master's programs offered by the TUM School of Management. For more information, please refer to the Academic and Examination Regulations (FPSO).\n[CARD]\nNotes on Verification and Validity\nWe cannot process any requests for verification of language certificates before you complete an online application via TUMonline. Language certificates sent directly from the providers by mail will also not be considered if there is no complete online application. Please upload your language certificate in PDF format during the online application. \t  Older recognized language certificates will also be accepted if they are uploaded in PDF format.

      "content": "Admission to degree programs at TUM is handled in several different ways. This page provides an overview of the admission procedures.\nBe sure to inform yourself about the details of the procedure for a specific program in the academic and examination regulations or the regulations on the aptitude assessment or aptitude recommendation.\nApplicants will be granted admission to a program with unrestricted admission when\nCertain programs require that an internship be completed before the start of studies. When applying for a Master's program, the applicant's Bachelor's degree will be checked to confirm that it is accredited. This is especially true if the applicant is transferring from another university.\nUnrestricted degree programs\nFirst, the applicant’s grade point average and subject-specific grades will be evaluated using a point system. Which grades are evaluated and how they are weighted depends on the applicant’s chosen degree program. Each program has a set of statutes that define the formula to be used. Depending on the degree program and the amount of points accumulated, applicants are either immediately admitted or invited to an admissions interview or written test carried out by the school. The interview or test helps determine if the applicant is capable of successfully completing the desired degree program. For certain programs, the interview or written test is also intended to determine whether the necessary language requirements are met. For some programs, applicants below a certain point threshold may be rejected without an interview or written test.\nPlease note: In contrast to the Numerus Clausus programs, the number of spots available (capacity limit) is not fixed. We accept all applicants we feel are qualified. As such, no lotteries will be held after final selections have been made, and there will be no list of alternatives for unsuccessful applicants to claim unwanted spots.\nDegree programs subject to aptitude assessment\nOur Aptitude recommendation supports students in choosing the degree program best suited to their interests and abilities.\nFirst, the applicant’s grade point average and subject-specific grades will be evaluated using a point system. Which grades are evaluated and how they are weighted depends on the applicant’s chosen degree program. Each program has a set of statues that defines the formula to be used. Depending on the amount of points accumulated, applicants are either immediately admitted or invited to a  mandatory, 20 minute interview carried out by the school. The interview helps determine if the applicant is capable of successfully completing the desired course of study. There is no written test.\nThe result of the interview determines whether the applicant receives a recommendation for the degree program. The purpose of the recommendation is to help students select the right program – it is, however, no mandatory requirement for admission.\nNC degree programs have a fixed number of spots available, awarded primarily based on the applicant's grade point average and the amount of time the student has been waiting for a spot. This amount of time is defined as the number of semesters that have elapsed since completion of secondary studies and in which the applicant has not been admitted to a German university. Periods in which the applicant audited classes or studied abroad also count as waiting time. Applicants who are not admitted are automatically put on an alternatives list. These students may be admitted at a later date in the event a spot is not accepted by another student.\nNC program eligibility will be based solely on the results of the past years. The grade point average of the last person to have been admitted constitutes the current NC standard. Since the number of applicants and their criteria (grades, waiting time, etc.) are unpredictable, it is still possible to apply with a lower grade point average than the current NC grades.\nDegree programs with restricted admission\nPlease note: The application and admission for NC programs is coordinated via the dialogue-oriented service procedure.\nIn the initial stage of this procedure, the grades you obtained during your Bachelor’s program, as well as your written documents, will be evaluated using a point system.\nFor some degree programs, the first stage of the aptitude assessment differs for applicants who have obtained their Bachelor’s degree in a country outside the scope of the “Lisbon Convention”: They have to take an online test. You can find out whether this applies to your desired degree program on the respective program page in the section “How do I apply?”.\nDepending on the number of points accumulated, applicants are either immediately admitted, rejected, or invited to a 20 minute admissions interview carried out by the school. In some cases interviews by telephone or video for international students are common. The interview helps determine if the applicant is capable of successfully completing the desired course of study. For some programs offered by the TUM School of Engineering and Design and the TUM School of Management a written test or the assessment of your academic qualification and your essay replace the interview.\nLecture period, lecture-free days, or enrollment periods – all semester dates and deadlines at a glance.\n+49 89 289 22245  Monday to Friday, 9:00 a.m. – 12:00 p.m.   studiumspam prevention@tum.de Please observe the e-mail etiquette.\nFind all the info on our services here.\nPersonal advising sessions with General Student Advising by appointment.\nCampus Munich, Arcisstraße 21, Room 0144, 80333 München\nMonday, Wednesday, Friday: 9 a.m. – 12 p.m.\nTuesday and Thursday, 1 p.m. – 4 p.m. (Student Information only)\n• Show convenient version of this site\n• Don't show this message again\n• Unrestricted degree programs\n• Aptitude assessment for Bachelor’s degree programs\n• Aptitude recommendation (SOV) for Bachelor’s degree applicants\n• Restricted degree programs (Numerus Clausus, NC)\n• Aptitude assessment for Master’s degree applicants\n• the online application was submitted in time and complete with all required documents,\n• and your documents have been reviewed.\n[CARD]\nDates and Deadlines\nDates and Deadlines\n\n\nLecture period, lecture-free days, or enrollment periods – all semester dates and deadlines at a glance.\n[CARD]\nDates and Deadlines\nDates and Deadlines\n[CARD]\nDates and Deadlines\n[CARD]\nLecture period, lecture-free days, or enrollment periods – all semester dates and deadlines at a glance.\n[CARD]\nStudent Advising and Information Services\nStudent Advising and Information Services\n\n\n +49 89 289 22245  Monday to Friday, 9:00 a.m. – 12:00 p.m.   studiumspam prevention@tum.de Please observe the e-mail etiquette.\nFind all the info on our services here.\nPersonal advising sessions with General Student Advising by appointment.\n[CARD]\nStudent Advising and Information Services\nStudent Advising and Information Services\n[CARD]\nStudent Advising and Information Services\n[CARD]\n+49 89 289 22245  Monday to Friday, 9:00 a.m. – 12:00 p.m.   studiumspam prevention@tum.de Please observe the e-mail etiquette.\nFind all the info on our services here.\nPersonal advising sessions with General Student Advising by appointment.\n[CARD]\nService Desk\nService Desk\n\n\n Campus Munich, Arcisstraße 21, Room 0144, 80333 München\nMonday, Wednesday, Friday: 9 a.m. – 12 p.m.\nTuesday and Thursday, 1 p.m. – 4 p.m. (Student Information only)\n[CARD]\nService Desk\nService Desk\n[CARD]\nService Desk\n[CARD]\nCampus Munich, Arcisstraße 21, Room 0144, 80333 München\nMonday, Wednesday, Friday: 9 a.m. – 12 p.m.\nTuesday and Thursday, 1 p.m. – 4 p.m. (Student Information only)",
