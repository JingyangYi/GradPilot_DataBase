The pace strains the built environment, with our shared civic infrastructure — our bridges, dams, airports, and highways, among other resources — nearing capacity levels. Civil engineers respond to the issue by improving existing systems and designing projects that answer the new challenges raised by modern society.\nOur MS program in Civil Engineering trains you to join their ranks. You can specialize in any of the following concentrations:\nOur program is flexible, and you may elect for a more general course of study by taking 2 courses in 3 areas of concentration.\nAdmission to this program requires you to hold a bachelor’s degree in civil engineering from a program accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET). You also need to have a 3.0 GPA or better. Applicants lacking a BS from an ABET-accredited program in civil engineering (including those possessing undergraduate degrees in other engineering disciplines, engineering science, engineering technology and architecture, or from a foreign university) will have their qualifications reviewed by a graduate adviser. Admission may be granted and may include the requirement for additional undergraduate courses to correct deficiencies. These additional courses are not counted toward the MS degree, nor are undergraduate courses included in computing graduate grade-point averages.\nFind out more about Admission Requirements.\nMS students are required to submit transcripts along with the syllabi for any courses they wish to transfer. Only courses with 3 or more credits are eligible for transfer. Please refer to the transcript credit request form here.\nA maximum of 9 credits of approved graduate work may be transferred and applied to your degree requirements. They would be awarded on a course-by-course basis and must be approved by the academic adviser, the graduate coordinator, and the department head.\nThe program requires the completion of 30 credits. Students must complete either the single area of concentration or general program requirements as described in the NYU Bulletin.\nProgram Requirements\nSample Course Schedule\nTo earn an MS degree from the School of Engineering, you must maintain a B average (3.0 GPA) or better in\nPoor scholastic performance (under 3.0 GPA) may lead to being placed on graduate probation.

Specific program objectives are to provide the skills and knowledge necessary to:\nStudents are afforded the opportunity to specialize in one of the following six tracks or take courses from each of the six:\nTo apply for admission to any Tandon graduate program, please contact the Office of Graduate Admissions.\nStudents seeking admission to the MS program should hold a bachelor’s degree in civil engineering from a program accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) and have a 3.0 GPA or better. Applicants lacking a BS from an ABET-accredited program in civil engineering (including those possessing undergraduate degrees in other engineering disciplines, engineering science, engineering technology and architecture, or from a foreign university) have their qualifications reviewed by a graduate adviser. Admission may be granted and may include the requirement for additional undergraduate courses to correct deficiencies. These additional courses are not counted toward the MS degree, nor are undergraduate courses included in computing graduate grade-point averages.\nThe program requires the completion of 30 credits. Students must either follow the General Plan or the Single Track Plan as described below:\nDepending on the track chosen, students will either be free to choose the remaining two courses (6 credits) on their own, or the graduate adviser may ask them to take certain technical courses. If students choose courses outside of Tandon, these courses must be at least 3 credits each. Courses cannot be selected from the School of Professional Studies.\nStudents are responsible for following the rules outlined in this bulletin for Tandon graduate students. While academic advisers consult with and advise students, students are responsible for ensuring that all degree requirements are fulfilled and for submitting all proper forms and applications. Students must meet with an academic adviser when they first enroll. Students must have a detailed program of study formally approved by an academic adviser before registration.\nThe academic adviser also handles requests for waivers of certain degree requirements, where warranted. Such waivers must be in writing and must be entered into the student’s departmental record. Where specific courses are waived, approval of the course instructor may also be required. When waivers are granted, students may be required to take other specific courses in their place; otherwise, the student may take other courses of their choosing. Students registering for guided studies (readings, projects, theses) are assigned advisers for each such activity. To register for guided study, students must submit written proposals for the topic(s) to be covered to such advisers before registration. To register, students must obtain written approval of the project adviser and the academic adviser.\nUpon successful completion of the program, graduates will have:\nTo earn any MS degree from NYU Tandon School of Engineering, students must maintain a B average or higher -- or a 3.0 cumulative grade point average (GPA) or higher -- in all graduate courses taken. Poor scholastic performance (under 3.0 GPA) will lead to the student being placed on academic probation. If the student’s GPA does not rise to 3.0 after two terms on probation, the student will be disqualified from further graduate study at Tandon.\nIn the event that a student is required to take undergraduate prerequisite courses as a condition of admission, a grade of B- or better is required for every prerequisite course taken, and the cumulative GPA of all required prerequisite courses must be at least 3.0.\nStudents may transfer up to 6 credits of acceptable courses toward the MS degree, subject to their academic adviser’s approval. To be transferred, the course(s) must relate to the student’s program and be from an accredited institution. A grade of B or better is required for granting of transfer credit. Courses graded on a pass/fail basis are not considered for transfer unless accompanied by a detailed written evaluation by the course instructor. All transfer requests must be accompanied by an official transcript from the transferring institution. Applications for transfer credits must be submitted for consideration before the end of the first semester of matriculation. Validation credits by examination may not be used toward any civil engineering graduate degree program.\nUniversity-wide policies can be found on the New York University Policy pages.\nAdditional academic policies can be found on the Tandon academic policy page.\nSend Page to Printer\nPrint this page.\nDownload Page (PDF)\nThe PDF will include all information unique to this page.\n• Program Description\n• AdmissionsDesired Background\n• Desired Background\n• Desired Background\n• Specialize in one of the primary subdisciplines (or tracks) of civil engineering or to achieve depth across a number of the subdisciplines;\n• Design and analyze civil engineering infrastructure;\n• Understand civil engineering materials, technologies and processes as applied to modern civil engineering infrastructure;\n• Obtain civil engineering project management skills; and\n• Provide a basis for continued, lifelong learning in the civil engineering profession.\n• Construction Management and Engineering\n• Structural Engineering\n• Geotechnical Engineering\n• Environmental and Water Resources Engineering\n• Urban Systems Engineering and Management\n• Highway and Traffic Engineering\n• Program Requirements\n• Tracks\n• Advising\n• Developed in-depth expertise in at least one subdiscipline of civil engineering or to achieve depth across a number of the subdisciplines,\n• Learned the design and analysis of civil engineering infrastructure,\n• Understood civil engineering materials, technologies, and processes as applied to modern civil engineering infrastructure,\n• Obtained civil engineering project management skills,\n• Gained a basis for continued, lifelong learning in the civil engineering profession.\n• Program Policies\n• NYU Policies\n• Tandon Policies\n• Send Page to Printer\nPrint this page.\n• Download Page (PDF)The PDF will include all information unique to this page.\n[HTML_TABLE]\nCourse | Title | Credits\nCore Courses | \nSelect four courses (12 credits) from the following: | 12\nCE-GY 6023 | Materials for Civil Engineers | \nCE-GY 6073 | Instrumentation, Monitoring and Condition Assessment of Civil Infrastructure | \nCE-GY 7673 | Environmental Impact Assessment | \nCE-GY 7843 | Urban Infrastructure Systems Management | \nCE-GY 8253 | Project Management for Construction | \nCE-GY 8283 | Risk Analysis | \nTrack Courses | \nStudents will select 18 credits of track courses, following either the General Plan or the Single Track Plan outlined below. | 18\nGeneral Plan | \nStudents following the General Plan will select two courses from three of the tracks below -- two courses from each one of their three chosen tracks. | \nSingle Track Plan | \nStudents following the Single Track Plan will choose four courses (12 credits) from one of the tracks below.
