The student is also required to acquire proficiency in the subject matter listed in paragraphs IA and IIA, and in elective subject matter covered in at least xix additional graduate courses listed in this syllabus. The student is expected to acquire this knowledge in at least four of the seven topics contained in the syllabus. Each student must submit to the Departmental Graduate Advisor, a Proposal of Fields of Study for the Ph.D. Degree containing a list of the required subject matter.\nEach student in this major field will be required to pass a closed book written examination based on the subject matter contained in the prerequisite courses, C&EE 235A, C&EE 237A, and any three elective graduate courses from her os his major field. The format of the examination is contained in the Appendix. Additional detail are available from the Chair of the Structures Ph.D. Field Committee.\nBreadth Requirements\nEach student selecting Structures as his/her major field will be held responsible for the body of knowledge contained in two independent PH.D. Minor Fields which complement the Structures Ph.D. Major Field. Each Minor Field is defined by a body of knowledge contained in three courses, at least two of which are at the graduate level. (Fields other than established Minor Fields in the School of Engineering and Applied Science are subject to the approval of the Structures Ph.D. Field Committee.) One of these Minor Fields may be selected from one of the seven topics contained in this Syllabus, provided the selected topical area is clearly distinct from the subject matter specified in the major field. The breadth requirement is satisfied by earning a 3.25 GPA in the courses listed in each of the Minor Fields.The student may petition the Structures Ph.D. Field Committee for permission to show proficiency in a body of knowledge which differs from the above recommended norm.\nMinor Field Requirements\nA student selecting Structures as his/her Minor Field will be held responsible for the body of knowledge contained in C&EE 235A and C&EE 237A and any other course listed in this Syllabus (including prerequisite courses).Students who select any of the courses listed in the Syllabus to satisfy requirements of a field other than Structures may not use that course as part of the Structures Minor Field.Students who wish to satisfy the Minor Field written examination requirement by grades in courses must achieve at least a 3.25 GPS in the courses used to satisfy Minor Field requirements.Students may petition the Structures PhD Field Committee for permission to show proficiency in a body of knowledge which differs from the above recommended norm.\nList of References\n\nPrerequisites\nP.1 Beer, F.P., and Johnston, E.R., Vector Mechanics for Engineers Statics and Dynamics, McGraw-Hill, 1972.P.2 Popov, E.P., Engineering Mechanics of Solids, McGraw-Hill, 1990.P.3 Ferguson, P., Breen, J., and Jirsa, J., Reinforced Concrete Fundamentals,5th Ed, Wiley, 1988.P.4 Norris, C.H., Wilbur, J.B., and Utku, S., Elementary Structural Analysis, McGraw-Hill, 1976.P.5 Salmon, C.G. and Johnson, J.E., Steel Structures: Design and Behavior, Intext Education Publisher, Current Edition.P.6 Timoshenko, S.P., Young, D.H., and Weaver, W., Jr., Vibration Problems in Engineering, Wiley, 1974.P.7 Ugural, A.C. and Fenster, S.K., Advanced Strength and Applied Elasticity, Elsevier, 1981.\n\nI.   Static Analysis\nI.1 Bathe, K-J. and Wilson, E.L., Numerical Methods in Finite Element Analysis, Prentice Hall, 1976.I.2 Boley, B.O. and Weiner, J.G., Theory of Thermal Stresses, R.
