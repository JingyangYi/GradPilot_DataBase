For this reason, tools and methods from all engineer­ing sciences, from computer science and mathematics, but also from biology and physics are used to work on and solve important problems in the analysis and development of new complex integrated systems and innovative products.\nThe content of the Master is built around a core of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and computer science, which can be supplemented with course content from mathematics, biology, physics and computer-based sciences. The education can also include lectures from the fields of product development as well as technology and inno­vation management. The specialist scientific training is supplemented by freely selectable courses from the humanities, social and political sciences.\nGraduates with knowledge in a range of engineering disciplines are highly sought after by the high-tech industry worldwide. Creating intelligent robots and systems requires skills from a broad range of subjects. It poses fundamental questions about the design, physical modeling and control of complex and highly interactive systems. Furthermore, it deals with various perception principles that enable the students to see and analyze their envi­ronment, reason about it and take appropriate actions toward the given goal.\n90 ECTS | 1.5 years\nMaster of Science ETH in Robotics, Systems and Control\nBachelor's degree:\nDownload MSc Robotics, Systems and Control (PDF, 180 KB)\nMaster’s degree programme in Robotics, Systems and Control\nETH Zurich\n                    Department of Mechanical and Process Engineering\n                    Leonhardstrasse 21\n                LEE K 208\n                8092 \n                Zurich\n            Switzerland\n• Homepage\n• Navigation\n• Search\n• Content\n• Footer\n• Contact\n• Sitemap\n• Electrical Engineering and Information Technology\n• Mechanical Engineering\n• Computer Science\n• Phone\n                        +41 44 632 24 57\n[CARD]\nContact\nMaddalena Velonà\n\n\n\nPhone\n                        +41 44 632 24 57\n\n\n\n\n\n            ETH Zurich\n                    Department of Mechanical and Process Engineering\n                    Leonhardstrasse 21\n                LEE K 208\n                8092 \n                Zurich\n            Switzerland\n\n\n\n\n\n              Show more\n\n              Show less\n[CARD]\nContact\n[CARD]\nMaddalena Velonà\n\n\n\nPhone\n                        +41 44 632 24 57\n\n\n\n\n\n            ETH Zurich\n                    Department of Mechanical and Process Engineering\n                    Leonhardstrasse 21\n                LEE K 208\n                8092 \n                Zurich\n            Switzerland\n\n\n\n\n\n              Show more\n\n              Show less\n[CARD]\nMaddalena Velonà\n[CARD]\nPhone\n                        +41 44 632 24 57\n[CARD]\nETH Zurich\n                    Department of Mechanical and Process Engineering\n                    Leonhardstrasse 21\n                LEE K 208\n                8092 \n                Zurich\n            Switzerland\n[CARD]\nShow more\n\n              Show less",
