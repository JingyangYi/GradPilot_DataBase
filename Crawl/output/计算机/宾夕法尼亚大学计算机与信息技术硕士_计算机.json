The MCIT program stems from a belief that advanced computer science coursework for people with undergraduate degrees in other diverse fields leads to highly successful career paths. Our graduates and their careers today stand as strong proof to this philosophy. Within the realm of academia, pursuing further advanced study in computer science is also an option open to MCIT graduates.\nDue to the goals and nature of the MCIT program, it is strictly for applicants with limited or no past experience in computer science. Candidates with an undergraduate major in Computer Science or closely related fields, should consider applying to the Master of Science in Engineering (MSE) program instead.\nTo learn more about the application and admission requirements please visit:\nVisit the Graduate Admissions website for additional FAQs.\nOur students come from backgrounds as diverse as chemistry, history, medicine, law, mathematics, literature and fine arts. However, what they all share in common is immense drive and a strong desire to succeed in the field of computing and technology. With their unique combination of skills in Computer Science and non-Computer Science fields, they have gone on to succeed in both technical and interdisciplinary careers. Moreover, current students are very well connected with our tight-knit alumni community, and the MCIT network is growing with each graduating batch.\nMCIT graduates emerge from the program as well-rounded and versatile individuals, and find themselves in a prime position in the job market. Past students have gone on to work in various roles at large companies like Google, Microsoft and Facebook, as well as at entrepreneurial start-ups and smaller-sized companies across the nation. Moreover, with their diverse backgrounds, our students are also in a unique position to fill technical jobs in industries such as bioinformatics, medicine, finance, telecommunications, media and many others. A significant proportion of our students do internships in the summer between their first and second years of study, and these internships often lead to full-time employment offers. Our accessible and tight-knit alumni network, together with Penn’s stellar Career Services and our supportive, reputed faculty, ensure that MCIT graduates are exposed to the many doors that are open to them after graduation.\nThe MCIT program is intended for bright, motivated students who have little or no background in Computer Science and who are looking to start a rewarding, successful career in computing and technology or pursue further education in this field.\nThe MCIT program is intended for students without backgrounds in Computer Science or related fields, and expects no prior experience in programming or developing software. Those with undergraduate degrees in Computer Science or related fields, or who have programming experience beyond the introductory level, should consider our department’s MSE programs instead.\nMCIT students are required to take a core curriculum of six courses that are designed to provide a solid foundation in Computer Science in the first year. Each student then takes his/her choice of four advanced electives.\nThe six required courses fall into three distinct categories:\nSoftware Development, Data Structures and Algorithms:\nMathematical Foundations, Algorithmic Analysis and Theory of Computation:\nComputer Architecture and Systems Programming:\nThese six core classes are offered exclusively to MCIT students, and often serve as a common bonding ground. These courses are followed by four advanced computer science electives of the student’s choosing. A wide variety of electives are offered every year, and each student can tailor their choice of subjects according to their interest.\nIn total the MCIT degree requires the completion of 10 courses. The degree is usually completed in three or four semesters.\nWe do not offer transfer credits for the MCIT on-campus program. Students who feel that they are already knowledgeable in a required course can request a waiver for that course, which will be granted subject to that particular course’s instructor approval. Note that waived courses do not reduce the overall number of courses required for the degree. Students are allowed to waive at most 2 courses.\nYes, we have a number of part-time students, typically taking one to two courses a semester. However, note that all MCIT courses are regular graduate-level courses that are scheduled during the academic term.\nNo. The first year MCIT curriculum is designed to be a continuous one year program, with classes taught in the spring building upon material taught in the fall. Due to this sequence of course offerings, candidates cannot start in the spring semester.\nOur admissions process is a rigorous one, and we strongly believe that if admitted, you have the full potential to succeed both in the program and beyond. The MCIT program has had outstanding graduation rates, and our students are often surprised by their own technical abilities and transformation after the program. Moreover, MCIT students have a vast array of resources to help them succeed. Our faculty are very invested in the success of this group of students, and their support, together with the MCIT program’s strong alumni connections and a devoted Career Services department, ensure that MCIT students are primed to succeed even if the tech industry is new to them.\nMCIT applications are handled by the same system that handles applications for other CIS graduate programs.

Moreover, with their diverse backgrounds, our students are also in a unique position to fill technical jobs in industries such as bioinformatics, medicine, finance, telecommunications, media and many others. A significant proportion of our students do internships in the summer between their first and second years of study, and these internships often lead to full-time employment offers. Our accessible and tight-knit alumni network, together with Penn’s stellar Career Services and our supportive, reputed faculty, ensure that MCIT graduates are exposed to the many doors that are open to them after graduation.\nProgram FAQ\n\n\n\nWho should apply to the MCIT program?\n\n\n\n\nThe MCIT program is intended for bright, motivated students who have little or no background in Computer Science and who are looking to start a rewarding, successful career in computing and technology or pursue further education in this field.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if I have an undergraduate degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, etc.? Or prior software development experience? Should I apply anyway?\n\n\n\n\nThe MCIT program is intended for students without backgrounds in Computer Science or related fields, and expects no prior experience in programming or developing software. Those with undergraduate degrees in Computer Science or related fields, or who have programming experience beyond the introductory level, should consider our department’s MSE programs instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat will I study?\n\n\n\n\n\nMCIT students are required to take a core curriculum of six courses that are designed to provide a solid foundation in Computer Science in the first year. Each student then takes his/her choice of four advanced electives.\nThe six required courses fall into three distinct categories:\nSoftware Development, Data Structures and Algorithms:\n\nCIT-5910: This course covers introductory programming and provides students with knowledge of software development tools and techniques.\nCIT-5940: This course builds upon CIT-5910 and covers advanced programming techniques, data structures and algorithms.\n\nMathematical Foundations, Algorithmic Analysis and Theory of Computation:\n\nCIT-5920: This course provides an introduction to discrete math – a crucial cornerstone to understanding the thinking behind various advances in modern computer science.\nCIT-5960: This course builds upon CIT-5920, and uses mathematical techniques and the theoretical foundations of computation to introduce students to more advanced algorithms and algorithmic thinking.\n\nComputer Architecture and Systems Programming:\n\nCIT-5930: This course teaches students about the inner workings of a computer, starting from transistors and building up towards modern computer architecture. It demystifies the boundary between hardware and software and teaches MCIT students what really goes on within a computer.\nCIT-5950: This course builds upon CIT-593, and shows students how they can use their knowledge of underlying computer architecture to design software systems. It equips students with the tools required to write programs for various devices in networked environments.\n\nThese six core classes are offered exclusively to MCIT students, and often serve as a common bonding ground. These courses are followed by four advanced computer science electives of the student’s choosing. A wide variety of electives are offered every year, and each student can tailor their choice of subjects according to their interest.\nIn total the MCIT degree requires the completion of 10 courses. The degree is usually completed in three or four semesters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the policy regarding course transfers and waivers?\n\n\n\n\nWe do not offer transfer credits for the MCIT on-campus program. Students who feel that they are already knowledgeable in a required course can request a waiver for that course, which will be granted subject to that particular course’s instructor approval. Note that waived courses do not reduce the overall number of courses required for the degree. Students are allowed to waive at most 2 courses.\n\n\n\n\n\nCan I be a part-time student?\n\n\n\n\nYes, we have a number of part-time students, typically taking one to two courses a semester. However, note that all MCIT courses are regular graduate-level courses that are scheduled during the academic term.\n\n\n\n\n\nCan I start in the spring semester?\n\n\n\n\nNo. The first year MCIT curriculum is designed to be a continuous one year program, with classes taught in the spring building upon material taught in the fall. Due to this sequence of course offerings, candidates cannot start in the spring semester.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow likely am I to succeed in this new field?\n\n\n\n\nOur admissions process is a rigorous one, and we strongly believe that if admitted, you have the full potential to succeed both in the program and beyond. The MCIT program has had outstanding graduation rates, and our students are often surprised by their own technical abilities and transformation after the program. Moreover, MCIT students have a vast array of resources to help them succeed. Our faculty are very invested in the success of this group of students, and their support, together with the MCIT program’s strong alumni connections and a devoted Career Services department, ensure that MCIT students are primed to succeed even if the tech industry is new to them.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the application process like?\n\n\n\n\nMCIT applications are handled by the same system that handles applications for other CIS graduate programs.

Here are some of the questions we hear most often. For additional information, please connect with us.\nIf you are admitted to a graduate program, we will email you instructions for beginning the I-20 application process. If you have questions about the I-20 process, please contact the University’s International Student and Scholar Services office.\nMaster’s students may request a transfer of up to two graduate-level courses, and doctoral students may request transfer of up to nine. We do not accept transfer credits from online courses for on-campus programs. Read more about transfer credit in the Graduate Student Handbook.\nYes. Start by submitting an application for the first program you are applying to, and then submit your other application(s) using the same account and login information. You will need to upload all the required application components and pay a separate application fee for each application you submit.\nIf you are admitted to more than one program, you may enroll in only one. You can apply to the second program (as a dual degree option) after you have completed at least one semester. See the Graduate Student Handbook for details.\nNo, but we do have some recommendations. For more, see How to Apply.\nSome of our programs require a BS in engineering, but others don’t. You can learn more about prerequisites in the descriptions of our master’s programs and Ph.D. programs.\nThat depends on the program, but in general, you must have a bachelor’s degree from an accredited college or university by the time classes begin. For details, see How to Apply.\nNo. Once you have submitted your application, it is considered final. We understand that you may want to share updated grades or achievements, but all applications are evaluated on the basis of the materials submitted at the time of submission.\nWe do not discuss application results with prospective students. You cannot apply to the same program for the same term if you have already received a decision, but you can apply for a later term.\nYes, you can defer for up to one academic year. To request a deferral, first accept the offer of admission and (if you are a master’s candidate) pay the tuition deposit. You can find a Deferral Request Form in your application portal.\nYour request must be approved by the program that offered you admission. Please allow up to one week for your deferral request to be reviewed.\nYou will be notified by email that a decision is available to be viewed online. You will need to log into your application to view the actual decision, and you won’t receive a letter by mail.\nOnce you have submitted your application, you will have access to your application checklist. From your checklist, you can review the status of your application and can edit or send reminders to your recommendation writers.\nIf all materials have been received, you can assume your application is complete and under review. You will receive an email notification when your decision is available.\nOur Career Services team offers a wealth of career resources, including on-campus recruiting and one-on-one advising related to career planning, job hunting, interviews and more.\nYes. The University of Pennsylvania has its very own campus police force, and the Philadelphia Police also patrol in and around campus. Shuttles and other services are available to make sure you’re safe as you travel around campus at night. See our Public Safety website for more.\nYes! Penn Engineering has several student organizations designed specifically for graduate students, and so does the University at large. In addition, the Graduate Student Center is a terrific resource for the entire Graduate Student population at Penn.\nPenn has a limited amount of on-campus housing for graduate students. If you choose to live off campus, Penn Off Campus Services can help you find the right place.\nGenerally speaking, you don’t need to contact Penn faculty prior to applying for your program; however, doctoral applicants may choose to do so to identify a principal investigator for research. Otherwise, if you have questions about the program, courses, or research, you are welcome to reach out to your department of interest.\nYes, we encourage prospective students to contact the specific department you are interested in for more information.\nYes! Our Engineering Master’s Advisory Board (EMAB) is made up of students who are happy to answer your questions. Contact a student ambassador in your department of interest.\nThe application system automatically sends an email to each recommender once you’ve entered their names and email addresses. If they haven’t received an email, it’s possible that you entered their information incorrectly or that the email ended up in their junk mail folder. You can log into your application or review your application checklist to re-notify your recommender.\nOur students go on to a wide variety of rewarding careers in academia, engineering and beyond. In one recent year, 93.3% of our master’s degree graduates were either employed, continuing their education, volunteering, serving in the military or not seeking a new position in the first six months after graduation. Learn more about our alumni by visiting the Penn Engineering Alumni Society website.\nWe don’t offer a nondegree enrollment option on campus, but we encourage you to explore our open online courses taught by Penn Engineering faculty in partnership with Coursera and edX.\nNo, Ph.D. students do not automatically receive master’s degrees. But you’re welcome to speak to your department about coordinating your Ph.D. coursework with master’s requirements so that you can get that degree as well.\nYes, but you need to submit an application, and admission is not guaranteed. Start by talking to faculty and staff of the Ph.D. program that interests you.\nYes. After your first semester, you may apply to transfer into another engineering master’s program. But you can’t transfer between on-campus programs and online programs. The Graduate Handbook has more information about transferring between programs and dual degree options.\nNo. Courses take place during weekdays, with the latest courses typically beginning at 4:30 p.m. Some of our programs allow you to take courses at other schools within the University, and those courses may have later start times.\nThat depends on your work schedule. Most of our courses are offered during the day, with the latest beginning at 4:30 p.m.\nYes, depending on the flexibility of your schedule and the requirements of your program. Once you have been admitted, you can discuss this with your program coordinator. International students are not eligible for part-time enrollment except in online programs.\nNo, our master’s programs do not require a thesis. Most of our programs allow students to complete their program either completely through coursework or with two to three credits’ worth of research toward a thesis or an independent study.\nAll of our master’s programs require 10 course units, except for Biotechnology, which requires 11. While most of our courses are 1 course unit, a small number are .5, so you will probably take 10 to 12 courses for your degree.\nOur programs can generally be completed in one to two years, depending on how many courses you take each semester. Visit the Program Page for your program of interest to learn more about course requirements and planning.\nAll documentation is submitted online through the application. If you receive and accept an offer of admission, you’ll receive further instructions on how to send the required official, final transcripts and certificates of graduation from your university or college.\nDue to the volume of applications we receive, please allow up to seven business days after submission for all materials to link to your application. You can monitor the status of your application and materials in the online Application Portal.\nYour scores need to be two years old or less. If you took the exam more than two years ago, you will need to retake it.\nWe waive the English-language requirement under certain circumstances. Please see How to Apply for details.\nWe evaluate applications as a whole portfolio, not on a single criterion, and we don’t require a minimum GRE score (or a GRE score at all).\nYour scores must be five years old or less. If you took the GRE more than five years ago, you’ll need to retake the exam if you want to submit GRE scores.\nNo – the GRE is optional for all of our graduate programs. But you’re welcome to submit your scores if you’ve taken the GRE within the past five years. Please have the official test scores submitted by the testing service to us at institution code 2888 and use the department code that best matches your program department.\nYou’ll receive full funding if you’re a doctoral student. A limited number of RA and TA positions are available to master’s students. You may also be able to find a part-time lab position through your academic department; please note that these opportunities are limited and not guaranteed. You can also explore scholarship opportunities, student employment or federal funding (if you’re a U.S. citizen or permanent resident).\nYou’re welcome to apply for part-time jobs on campus, but there is no formal association between an on-campus job and tuition. You may qualify for a work-study position based on your financial aid application.\nGraduate tuition at Penn Engineering is charged per course unit, not per semester or year. In other words, how much you pay per term depends on the number of courses you take.

Transcripts must include courses taken, credit hours, and grades earned. \nIf your unofficial transcript is not in English, we encourage you to use a transcript evaluation and translation service, such as Educational Perspectives and World Education Services (WES). If you are from a Chinese institution, we encourage you to use the Center for Student Services and Development.  \nOfficial transcripts are only required if you have been admitted and choose to enroll.\nOfficial Transcripts Required If Admitted: \nPlease arrange for your official transcripts and degree documents to be sent directly to Graduate Admissions as soon as they become available with the degree conferral posted. In order for a transcript to be considered official, it must come directly from your school or third-party evaluation service.\nWhen requesting documents to be sent to Penn Engineering Graduate Admissions, please ensure that you have indicated the appropriate office in the drop-down selections. In instances where multiple University of Pennsylvania profiles are available, you should select the option for the University of Pennsylvania, Dept: SEAS Graduate Admissions (Engineering) when possible. Please do not select the main University of Pennsylvania Office as we cannot access transcripts sent to this office or you will need to resend them to the correct office. \nSubmitting Your Official Transcripts:\n\nFor U.S. Institutions: Provide your final official transcript showing coursework completion, degree earned, and degree conferral date. Transcripts must be submitted via a secure electronic service, sent to graduate-admissions@seas.upenn.edu.\nFor International Institutions: For each university or college you’ve attended outside the U.S., we require that you contact a member of the National Association of Credential Evaluation Services (NACES) to have a course-by-course evaluation of your non-U.S. transcript(s) sent electronically from the NACES member to Penn Engineering Graduate Admissions. This evaluation should include course titles, grades received, GPA, and U.S. degree equivalency. While Penn Engineering accepts course-by-course evaluations from any NACES member,  many of our applicants have been successful using: \n\nEducational Perspectives\nEducational Credential Evaluators (ECE)\nInternational Education Evaluations (IEE)\nSpanTran\nWorld Education Services (WES)\n\n\n\nWe encourage you to review our Official Transcript Policy if you have additional questions.\n\n\n\n\n The Application Fee\n\n\nPlease pay the $90 nonrefundable application fee along with your online application. You may qualify for a fee waiver if you are in one of the following categories: \n\nUS citizens or permanent residents with proven low-income background\nApplicants with Penn or U.S. military affiliation\nEligible students from a US partner institution applying to an Accelerated Master’s program\n\nIf you meet one of these criteria, your fee will be automatically waived. \n\n\n\n\nGRE (Optional)\n\n\nThe GRE is optional during the current application cycle, and it won’t hurt your application if you choose not to take it. But if you have taken the exam and received valid scores, we encourage you to submit them. Here’s what you need to know if you decide to submit your scores: \n\nThe institution code to use for the GRE exam is 2888.\nTest results must be valid at the time you submit your application. Test scores are valid for five years.\nYour official scores must be submitted by the application deadline.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnglish Language Proficiency (for international students)\n\n\nIf you are an international applicant or a non-US citizen or permanent resident and English is not your native language, you must submit official scores for (1) the Test Of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) iBT, (2) the International English Language Testing System (IELTS), or (3) Duolingo English Test (DET).\n\nThe institution code for the TOEFL exam is 2888.\nTest results must be valid at the time you submit your application. Test scores are valid for two years.\nYou must take the exam by the application deadline.\nTest scores from at-home administration of the TOEFL exams are accepted. \nPlease send your IELTS score report electronically to “University of Pennsylvania School of Engineering and Applied Science.”\nPlease send your DET score report electronically to “ University of Pennsylvania – School of Engineering and Applied Science – Graduate.”\n\nRecommended Scores:\nYou don’t have to achieve a particular score to be admitted, but we recommend that you aim for at least the following scores:\n\nTOEFL: 100\nIELTS: 7.5\nDET: 135\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Waivers\n\n\nTo have the English-language requirement waived, you must meet one of the following criteria by the time of matriculation:\n\nGraduate from a program in the United States;\nAttend school in a country in which English is recognized as the official language; or,\nGraduate from an institution where the medium of instruction is English, and this is indicated on the unofficial transcript\n\nThis requirement will be waived after you submit your application and may take 3-5 business days to reflect in your checklist.",

Penn Engineering Graduate Admissions provides links to create an application or log in to view an existing application here.\nInformation about our Doctoral (Ph.D.), Master of Science in Engineering in Computer and Information Science (MSE), and the Master of Computer and Information Technology (MCIT) graduate programs can be found here. You can also access information about our faculty, research and courses.\nApplicants to the CIS Doctoral and CIS/MSE graduate programs are expected to have a strong academic background in computer science; the core courses for Doctoral students are the same core courses taken by CIS/MSE students.\nThe MCIT graduate program is designed for candidates with a strong academic background in an area other than computer science; i.e., candidates with a strong academic background in computer science should NOT apply to the MCIT graduate program.\nCandidates may apply to the doctoral program only as full-time students.\nPenn Engineering Graduate Admissions provides an admissions FAQ here.\nAdmission statistics – number of applicants/admits, average GRE scores, etc. – for our graduate programs for the past several years are available here. This will give you an idea of what is expected of applicants.\nDepartmental financial aid is available only for doctoral students. Applicants to the CIS Doctoral Program are considered for available funding; it is not necessary to submit extra material to be considered for funding.\nThere is no departmental funding available for master’s students. There are no RA positions available in the department; only research fellow positions for doctoral candidates. Teaching Assistant (TA) duties are generally met by Ph.D. candidates participating in a Teaching Practicum. Information about other funding resources can be found here.\nThe University of Pennsylvania participates in the Yellow Ribbon Program; information can be found here.\nSubmatriculation/Accelerated Master’s: Undergraduate students applying for Submatriculation/Accelerated Master’s status must have completed the courses listed below at the time of application:\nThe application must include a plan for completing all requirements for their current undergraduate and CIS/MSE program.  Applicants should have at least a 3.2 GPA in their major, as well at least a B+ average in the chosen six courses above.\nSchool of Engineering Information regarding the Submatriculation/Accelerated master’s option is accessible here.\nInformation re: requesting to be considered for a dual degree/transfer can be found here.\nRequirements for engineering masters students requesting consideration to transfer to or do a dual degree with the CIS/MSE program:\nTransfers requests only (in addition to above requirements):\nStudents requesting to be considered for dual degree status/transfer status should not make such a request until after completion, including posting of grades, of the first semester in the program to which they were originally admitted.\nSuch requests are evaluated with the same criteria used in evaluating candidates applying directly to our graduate programs; i.e. candidates should have the appropriate background, academic credentials, test scores, etc. Click here to access School of Engineering info re: dual degrees/transferring programs.\nProgram Offerings\n\nDoctoral Program\nMSE in CIS\nMaster of Computer and Information Technology\nMSE in Data Science\nMSE in Robotics\nMSE in Computer Graphics and Game Technology\n\n\nHow to Apply\n\nAdmissions Statistics\n\n\nFellowships + Aid\nAdvising\n\nNew Students\nHow to Register\nHandbook\nForms\nTutoring\nGraduation + Thesis Information\nResources\n\n\nAcademic + Industry Job Postings\nRedian Furxhiu\nProgram Manager for on-campus Graduate MCIT, CIS/MSE and CGGT programs\nOffice: 308 Levine\nPhone: 215-898-1668\nEmail: redian@seas.upenn.edu\nStaci Kaplan\nProgram Manager for DATS (Data Science MSE)\nOffice: 308 Levine\nPhone: 215-573-2431\nEmail: stacilk@seas.upenn.edu\nBritton Carnevali\nDoctoral Program Manager\nOffice: 310 Levine\nPhone: 215-898-5515\nEmail: brittonc@cis.upenn.edu\nMariel Celentano\nGraduate Coordinator for ROBO\nOffice: 459 Levine\nPhone: 215-573-4907\nEmail: robo-coord@seas.upenn.edu\nJulia Esposito\nPICS Program Coordinator, SCMP Academic Coordinator\nOffice: 3401 Walnut, 5th Fl.\nPhone: 215-573-6037\nEmail: jnespos@seas.upenn.edu\n• Graduate\n• How to Apply\n• CIS 1200, CIS 1210, CIS 1600\n• One theory course (CIS 2620, CIS 3200)\n• Any two of the following project oriented classes: (NETS 2120, CIS 3410, CIS/ESE 3500, CIS 4710/5710, CIS 3800, CIS 4120/CIS 5120, CIS 4500/CIS 5500, CIS 4550/5550, CIS 4600/CIS 5600, CIS 5050, CIS 5530)\n• Students interested in pursuing a dual or transfer should first talk with their current program.\n• Minimum GPA of 3.7\n• Transfer Requests can be made only after the end of first semester at Penn, but no later than the add/drop deadline of 3rd semester.\n• Dual-Degree Requests can be made only after the end of first semester at Penn, but no later than add/drop deadline of the student’s final semester.\n• External candidates must have received a grade of A- or above in a CIS graduate course.\n• Application Documents: in addition to the dual/or transfer application form, students must include a Personal Statement, Resume, copy of undergraduate transcript.\n• Note, submitting an application does not guarantee acceptance.

They are the prerequisites for CIT 5940, 5950, and 5960, respectively, which are offered in the Spring semester only.\nCourses can be waived or replaced only with the permission of the instructor. As of Fall 2016, students must pass a proficiency exam in order to waive a course. All MCIT courses must be completed (or waivers obtained) during the first semester that the course is offered during the student’s time in the program. Students may not waive or replace more than two required MCIT courses. Courses that are waived need to be replaced with a suitable alternative.  While students are allowed to waive at most 2 courses a semester, no student can take a course and then waive the course that this course is a prereq for. Therefore, if you take 5910, you will take 5940. If you take 5920, you will take 5960. If you take 5930, you are expected to take 5950.\n4 Elective Courses\nClick here for all CIS graduate course options.\nOne course from the list of pre-approved non CIS graduate courses, found here, may be used as an elective. Graduate courses offered in other departments may count as an elective with the prior approval of the MCIT program director; in general, such courses must have a strong technical component in order to be approved.\nA minimum GPA of 2.7 for master’s students must be maintained in order to be considered in good academic standing. If this minimum is not maintained, academic probation or dismissal from the program will be invoked. A 2.7 final GPA must be achieved to graduate in all situations.\nNo grade lower than a “C-” will be counted in courses designated as “core” courses.\nThe Academic Standing Requirements can be found here.\nMCIT students may apply to continue in the Master of Science in Engineering in Computer and Information (CIS/MSE) program. Students pursuing this dual degree route need to satisfy a minimum GPA requirement, have earned a high grade in at least one CIS elective, and have completed the majority of the MCIT requirements at the time of applying. In addition to the ten courses required for the MCIT program, students continuing in the CIS/MSE program need to take six additional CIS graduate courses for a total of sixteen credits; satisfactory completion results in the awarding of the MCIT and CIS/ MSE degrees.

Research and teaching form the essence of our doctoral program. Our curriculum is designed to develop the intellectual skills essential for the rapidly changing character of research and to meet the demands of academe and industry. Students develop their own advanced study focus, working with faculty mentors on topics ranging from the core computer science discipline to diverse scholarly interactions within Penn Engineering and the University.\nThe Master of Science in Engineering in Computer and Information Science degree program is designed to allow flexible planning of advanced study. The MSE student develops their own advanced study focus, and can arrange interdisciplinary programs in such areas as CIS and Telecommunications, CIS and Computational Linguistics, CIS and Biomedical Computation, etc. Graduate studies in the Department offer the possibility for rewarding exploration and research. This is a uniquely exciting place to be.\nThe Master of Computer and Information Technology (MCIT) program is for applicants whose undergraduate degree is not in computer science. Candidates with an undergraduate major in computer science should consider applying instead to the Master of Science in Engineering (MSE) program. The MCIT program stems from a belief that advanced computer science coursework for people with degrees in other fields leads to highly successful career paths. This innovative program allows those with no computing experience to begin an IT career, those who are experienced in IT to advance, and it prepares students for future advanced study in computer science. Students can enroll either full- or part-time.\nNote: Information on this site is for the on-campus program. Students interested in the online MCIT program should visit this site.\nPenn’s Master of Science in Engineering (MSE) in Data Science prepares students for a wide range of data-centric careers, whether in technology and engineering, consulting, science, policy-making, or understanding patterns in literature, art or communications.\nThe Data Science Program can typically be completed in one-and-a-half to two years. It blends leading-edge courses in core topics such as machine learning, big data analytics, and statistics, with a variety of electives and an opportunity to apply these techniques in a domain specialization – a depth area – of choice.\nA traditional embedded system is an integrated system consisting of hardware and software. In the more contemporary view, an embedded system, sometimes also called a cyber-physical system, consists of a collection of computing devices communicating with one another and interacting with the physical world via sensors and actuators in a feedback loop. Increasingly, such systems are everywhere, from smart buildings to medical devices to automobiles. Skills needed to develop such systems lie at the intersection of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering. The Master of Science in Engineering in Embedded Systems (EMBS) is offered jointly by the Departments of Computer and Information Science and Electrical and Systems Engineering within the School of Engineering and Applied Science. This innovative and unique degree program will train students in the fundamentals of design and implementation of cyber-physical systems.\nThe modern expert in robotics and intelligent systems must be proficient in artificial intelligence, computer vision, control systems, dynamics, machine learning, as well as the design, programming, and prototyping of robotic systems. Such subjects typically reside in different departments, and departmental programs do not offer the flexibility for cross-departmental training. The Master of Science In Engineering (MSE) program in Robotics offers a more balanced and flexible academic curriculum that cuts across multiple departments.\nInteractive entertainment and computer-animated visual effects are now part of our mainstream culture. Creating such computer-generated imagery, however, is no trivial task. It requires a delicate blending of art with science by teams of highly skilled professionals, including artists, animators, writers, designers, engineers and software developers working long hours with cutting-edge technology and tools. Currently there are very few academic programs at four-year research universities adequately preparing students for such positions. The Master of Science in Engineering in Computer Graphics and Game Technology (CGGT) was created specifically to address this need.\nProgram Offerings\n\nDoctoral Program\nMSE in CIS\nMaster of Computer and Information Technology\nMSE in Data Science\nMSE in Robotics\nMSE in Computer Graphics and Game Technology\n\n\nHow to Apply\n\nAdmissions Statistics\n\n\nFellowships + Aid\nAdvising\n\nNew Students\nHow to Register\nHandbook\nForms\nTutoring\nGraduation + Thesis Information\nResources\n\n\nAcademic + Industry Job Postings\nRedian Furxhiu\nProgram Manager for on-campus Graduate MCIT, CIS/MSE and CGGT programs\nOffice: 308 Levine\nPhone: 215-898-1668\nEmail: redian@seas.upenn.edu\nStaci Kaplan\nProgram Manager for DATS (Data Science MSE)\nOffice: 308 Levine\nPhone: 215-573-2431\nEmail: stacilk@seas.upenn.edu\nBritton Carnevali\nDoctoral Program Manager\nOffice: 310 Levine\nPhone: 215-898-5515\nEmail: brittonc@cis.upenn.edu\nMariel Celentano\nGraduate Coordinator for ROBO\nOffice: 459 Levine\nPhone: 215-573-4907\nEmail: robo-coord@seas.upenn.edu\nJulia Esposito\nPICS Program Coordinator, SCMP Academic Coordinator\nOffice: 3401 Walnut, 5th Fl.\nPhone: 215-573-6037\nEmail: jnespos@seas.upenn.edu\n• Graduate\n• Program Offerings\n• Program Offerings\n\nDoctoral Program\nMSE in CIS\nMaster of Computer and Information Technology\nMSE in Data Science\nMSE in Robotics\nMSE in Computer Graphics and Game Technology\n• Doctoral Program\n• MSE in CIS\n• Master of Computer and Information Technology\n• MSE in Data Science\n• MSE in Robotics\n• MSE in Computer Graphics and Game Technology\n• How to Apply\n\nAdmissions Statistics\n• Admissions Statistics\n• Fellowships + Aid\n• Advising\n\nNew Students\nHow to Register\nHandbook\nForms\nTutoring\nGraduation + Thesis Information\nResources\n• New Students\n• How to Register\n• Handbook\n• Forms\n• Tutoring\n• Graduation + Thesis Information\n• Resources\n• Academic + Industry Job Postings\n• Doctoral Program\n• MSE in CIS\n• Master of Computer and Information Technology\n• MSE in Data Science\n• MSE in Robotics\n• MSE in Computer Graphics and Game Technology\n• Admissions Statistics\n• New Students\n• How to Register\n• Handbook\n• Forms\n• Tutoring\n• Graduation + Thesis Information\n• Resources\n[GRID_TABLE]\nProgram Offerings\nDoctoral Program (Ph.D.) in Computer and Information Science\nThe Doctoral Program in Computer and Information Science welcomes candidates with strong training in any of the disciplines related to modern information processing, with an emphasis on computer science and mathematics.

Research and teaching form the essence of our doctoral program. Our curriculum is designed to develop the intellectual skills essential for the rapidly changing character of research and to meet the demands of academe and industry. Students develop their own advanced study focus, working with faculty mentors on topics ranging from the core computer science discipline to diverse scholarly interactions within Penn Engineering and the University.\nLearn More\nMaster of Science in Engineering (MSE) in Computer and Information Science (CIS)\nThe Master of Science in Engineering in Computer and Information Science degree program is designed to allow flexible planning of advanced study. The MSE student develops their own advanced study focus, and can arrange interdisciplinary programs in such areas as CIS and Telecommunications, CIS and Computational Linguistics, CIS and Biomedical Computation, etc. Graduate studies in the Department offer the possibility for rewarding exploration and research. This is a uniquely exciting place to be.\nLearn More\nMaster of Computer and Information Technology (MCIT)\nThe Master of Computer and Information Technology (MCIT) program is for applicants whose undergraduate degree is not in computer science. Candidates with an undergraduate major in computer science should consider applying instead to the Master of Science in Engineering (MSE) program. The MCIT program stems from a belief that advanced computer science coursework for people with degrees in other fields leads to highly successful career paths. This innovative program allows those with no computing experience to begin an IT career, those who are experienced in IT to advance, and it prepares students for future advanced study in computer science. Students can enroll either full- or part-time.\nNote: Information on this site is for the on-campus program. Students interested in the online MCIT program should visit this site.\nLearn More\nMaster of Science in Engineering (MSE) in Data Science\nPenn’s Master of Science in Engineering (MSE) in Data Science prepares students for a wide range of data-centric careers, whether in technology and engineering, consulting, science, policy-making, or understanding patterns in literature, art or communications.\nThe Data Science Program can typically be completed in one-and-a-half to two years. It blends leading-edge courses in core topics such as machine learning, big data analytics, and statistics, with a variety of electives and an opportunity to apply these techniques in a domain specialization – a depth area – of choice.\nRead More\nMaster of Science in Engineering (MSE) in Embedded Systems (EMBS)\nA traditional embedded system is an integrated system consisting of hardware and software. In the more contemporary view, an embedded system, sometimes also called a cyber-physical system, consists of a collection of computing devices communicating with one another and interacting with the physical world via sensors and actuators in a feedback loop. Increasingly, such systems are everywhere, from smart buildings to medical devices to automobiles. Skills needed to develop such systems lie at the intersection of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering. The Master of Science in Engineering in Embedded Systems (EMBS) is offered jointly by the Departments of Computer and Information Science and Electrical and Systems Engineering within the School of Engineering and Applied Science. This innovative and unique degree program will train students in the fundamentals of design and implementation of cyber-physical systems.\nLearn More\nMaster of Science in Engineering (MSE) in Robotics (ROBO)\nThe modern expert in robotics and intelligent systems must be proficient in artificial intelligence, computer vision, control systems, dynamics, machine learning, as well as the design, programming, and prototyping of robotic systems. Such subjects typically reside in different departments, and departmental programs do not offer the flexibility for cross-departmental training. The Master of Science In Engineering (MSE) program in Robotics offers a more balanced and flexible academic curriculum that cuts across multiple departments.\nLearn More\nMaster of Science in Engineering (MSE) in Computer Graphics and Game Technology (CGGT)\nInteractive entertainment and computer-animated visual effects are now part of our mainstream culture. Creating such computer-generated imagery, however, is no trivial task. It requires a delicate blending of art with science by teams of highly skilled professionals, including artists, animators, writers, designers, engineers and software developers working long hours with cutting-edge technology and tools. Currently there are very few academic programs at four-year research universities adequately preparing students for such positions. The Master of Science in Engineering in Computer Graphics and Game Technology (CGGT) was created specifically to address this need.\nLearn More\n[GRID_TABLE]\nGraduate Program:\n\n\n\nProgram Offerings\n\nDoctoral Program\nMSE in CIS\nMaster of Computer and Information Technology\nMSE in Data Science\nMSE in Robotics\nMSE in Computer Graphics and Game Technology\n\n\nHow to Apply\n\nAdmissions Statistics\n\n\nFellowships + Aid\nAdvising\n\nNew Students\nHow to Register\nHandbook\nForms\nTutoring\nGraduation + Thesis Information\nResources\n\n\nAcademic + Industry Job Postings\n\nYour CIS Contacts:\nRedian Furxhiu\nProgram Manager for on-campus Graduate MCIT, CIS/MSE and CGGT programs\nOffice: 308 Levine\nPhone: 215-898-1668\nEmail: redian@seas.upenn.edu\nStaci Kaplan\nProgram Manager for DATS (Data Science MSE)\nOffice: 308 Levine\nPhone: 215-573-2431\nEmail: stacilk@seas.upenn.edu\nBritton Carnevali\nDoctoral Program Manager\nOffice: 310 Levine\nPhone: 215-898-5515\nEmail: brittonc@cis.upenn.edu \nMariel Celentano\nGraduate Coordinator for ROBO\nOffice: 459 Levine\nPhone: 215-573-4907\nEmail: robo-coord@seas.upenn.edu\nJulia Esposito\nPICS Program Coordinator, SCMP Academic Coordinator\nOffice: 3401 Walnut, 5th Fl.\nPhone: 215-573-6037\nEmail: jnespos@seas.upenn.edu\nProgram Offerings\n\nDoctoral Program\nMSE in CIS\nMaster of Computer and Information Technology\nMSE in Data Science\nMSE in Robotics\nMSE in Computer Graphics and Game Technology\nDoctoral Program\nMSE in CIS\nMaster of Computer and Information Technology\nMSE in Data Science\nMSE in Robotics\nMSE in Computer Graphics and Game Technology\nHow to Apply\n\nAdmissions Statistics\nAdmissions Statistics\nFellowships + Aid\nAdvising\n\nNew Students\nHow to Register\nHandbook\nForms\nTutoring\nGraduation + Thesis Information\nResources\nNew Students\nHow to Register\nHandbook\nTutoring\nGraduation + Thesis Information\nResources\nAcademic + Industry Job Postings\n[GRID_TABLE]\nProgram Offerings\n\nDoctoral Program\nMSE in CIS\nMaster of Computer and Information Technology\nMSE in Data Science\nMSE in Robotics\nMSE in Computer Graphics and Game Technology\nDoctoral Program\nMSE in CIS\nMaster of Computer and Information Technology\nMSE in Data Science\nMSE in Robotics\nMSE in Computer Graphics and Game Technology\nHow to Apply\n\nAdmissions Statistics\nAdmissions Statistics\nFellowships + Aid\nAdvising\n\nNew Students\nHow to Register\nHandbook\nForms\nTutoring\nGraduation + Thesis Information\nResources\nNew Students\nHow to Register\nHandbook\nTutoring\nGraduation + Thesis Information\nResources\nAcademic + Industry Job Postings",
