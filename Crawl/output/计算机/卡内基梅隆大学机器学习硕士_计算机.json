Do I need an undergraduate degree in computer science? What test scores do I need?\n[HEADING] Are GRE scores required?\n[HEADING] Is it possible to complete the degree online?\n[HEADING] Is it possible to complete the degree part-time?\n[HEADING] Is it possible to apply or begin the program in spring?\n[HEADING] Can I transfer in from another university or from another program at CMU?\n[HEADING] I already have a master's degree. Can I still apply?\n[HEADING] How does the Master's in Machine Learning program compare with other programs at CMU?\n[HEADING] Is this a STEM program?\n[HEADING] Where are your graduates working?\n[HEADING] When should I apply? When will I hear back?\nThe Master's in Machine Learning program is intended for applicants not integrating the master's into their CMU bachelor's degree.\nCMU undergraduates are encouraged to consider the Fifth-Year Master's in Machine Learning, but are welcome to apply to this 16-month program instead.\nThe Master's in Machine Learning program requires six core courses, three electives and a practicum. Refer to the Machine Learning Master's Curriculum page for full information. As the schedule below shows, the M.S. in machine learning can be completed in three semesters by a motivated and well-prepared student. However, some students finish in four semesters, spending the additional time on either research or filling in gaps in their undergraduate training.\nThe M.S. in Machine Learning program does not provide any financial support and the student must pay tuition, student fees and living expenses on their own.\nSee the financial information page for costs.\nThe Machine Learning Department uses the School of Computer Science (SCS) Graduate Online Application. You may apply for multiple programs at Carnegie Mellon and the Machine Learning Department's M.S. Admissions Committee will consider your application independently.\nApplications are accepted only once a year. All students begin the program in August, having applied the previous December.\nFor application information, including application deadlines, refer to the SCS Master's Admissions page and SCS Master's Admissions FAQ.\nWe welcome applicants from a variety of backgrounds and an undergraduate degree in computer science is not required.\nIncoming students must have a strong background in computer science, including a solid understanding of complexity theory and good programming skills, as well as a good background in mathematics. Specifically, the first-year courses assume at least one year of college-level probability and statistics, as well as matrix algebra and multivariate calculus.\nFor our introductory machine learning course, our self-assessment test will give you some idea of the background we expect students to have. (For the M.S., you're looking at the \"modest requirements.\") Generally, you need to have some reasonable programming skills, with experience in Matlab/R/scipy-numpy being especially helpful and Java and Python being more useful than C; and a solid math background, especially in probability/statistics, linear algebra, and matrix and tensor calculus.\nThe average scores of accepted applicants for the MS in Machine Learning for fall 2025 were as follows:\nScores varied significantly and are only a small portion of applicants' qualifications. We do take people with a range of backgrounds for the master's program. For information about our selectivity rate and other statistics, refer to the comparison PDF of all SCS master's programs.\nFor applicants applying to the MS in Machine Learning - Applied Study program in Fall 2025 for a start date of August 2026, GRE scores are optional.We do not require or expect applicants to take a GRE Subject Test.\nNo. At this time, we do not offer online or distance-learning classes. You must be physically present in Pittsburgh and able to attend classes on campus to complete the program.\nYes, you can study part-time as long as you can attend classes. International students should be aware that student visas require students to complete the program full-time and finish by the end of their third semester (in December).\nNo. Applications are accepted only in December and students must begin the program in August. We cannot make exceptions to this due to the timing of our set core courses.\nNo, you may not simply transfer into our program. You must submit an application and be accepted into the program, following the same application procedure as other applicants. Furthermore, the machine learning program does not accept transfer credit from other universities, although in certain situations a specific course requirement may be waived and an additional elective may be taken in its place.\nCurrent CMU undergraduates may be able to apply for the fifth-year master's, which begins immediately after they have completed their bachelor's degree.\nYes, we welcome applicants from all backgrounds. As with all applicants, make sure that your statement of purpose makes it clear why you believe an additional master's will help you achieve your goals.\nThe School of Computer Science has compiled a comparison of its master's programs, including a PDF comparing program outcomes, average applicant scores and selectivity rates.\nYes. As a program in Carnegie Mellon's School of Computer Science, the Master's in Machine Learning is a STEM program.\nThe Career and Professional Development Center compiles Post-Graduate Salaries and Destination Information about all graduates.\nThe application deadline can be found on the SCS Master's Admissions page. It changes from year to year, but is generally in late November or early December. You should expect an email response sometime in February. If you apply to multiple programs, you should expect to receive separate responses from each program.\n• 10-701 or 10-715: Intro to Machine Learning\n• 36-700 or 36-705: Statistics\n• One Elective\n• Two Core Courses\n• One Elective\n• Practicum (internship or research related to machine learning)\n• 10-718: Machine Learning in Practice\n• One Core Course\n• One Elective\n• Undergraduate Overall GPA: 3.9/4.0 or 9.5/10.0.\n• GRE Quantitative: 169 (88th percentile)\n• GRE Verbal: 160 (80th percentile)\n• GRE Analytical Writing: 4.1 (63rd percentile)\n• TOEFL: 111\n[GRID_TABLE]\nThe Master's in Machine Learning program requires six core courses, three electives and a practicum.

      "content": "[HEADING] Core Requirements\n[HEADING] Required Core Courses\n[HEADING] Plus Any Two of the Following Menu Core* Courses\n[HEADING] Plus One Elective\nThe curriculum for the Machine Learning Ph.D. is built on a foundation of six core courses and one elective.  A typical full-time Ph.D. student course load during the first two years consists of two classes each term (at 12 units per class) plus 24 units of research. It is expected that all Ph.D. students engage in active research from their first semester. Roughly half of a student's time should be allocated to research and half to courses until the courses are completed.\n*Students who are in the joint Ph.D. Program in Machine Learning and Statistics may satisfy this requirement through the ADA project in Statistics. Students in the joint Machine Learning-CNBC program may satisfy it by completing a data-intensive project for their second year milestone. Students in the Machine Learning-Heinz joint Ph.D. also complete it in their program.\n*Students in the Statistics and Machine Learning Joint Ph.D. Program must choose two of the menu core courses with a prefix in a department that is not their home department. Thus, statistics joint students should choose two 10- and 15- prefix courses, and machine learning joint students should choose two 36- and 15- courses. Students accepted to the statistics and machine learning program before spring 2021 are grandfathered in and follow previous rules.\nNote: Some students will have taken some of the above courses before entering the MLD Ph.D. program. For example, as master's students at CMU. If students have previously taken the above-named courses at CMU before joining the MLD Ph.D. program, those courses may be used to satisfy the requirements and do not need to be repeated. (Courses can only be used for a single master's degree.)\nSome students will have taken similar courses at other universities before entering the MLD Ph.D. program. Based on such equivalent coursework, any student can apply to replace (not reduce) up to two courses with either menu cores or electives. All requests must be supported by the adviser, and will be evaluated by the Ph.D. Director.\nView a sample schedule.\n• 10-715: Advanced Introduction to Machine Learning\n• 10-716: Advanced Machine Learning — Theory and Methods\n• 36-705: Intermediate Statistics\n• 10-718: Machine Learning in Practice*\n• 10-703: Deep Reinforcement Learning or 10-707: Topics in Deep Learning\n• 10-708: Probabilistic Graphical Models\n• 10-725: Optimization for Machine Learning (formerly Convex Optimization)\n• 10-734: Foundations of Autonomous Decision Making Under Uncertainty\n• 10-805: Machine Learning With Large Datasets\n• 15-750: Algorithms in the Real World or 15-850: Advanced Algorithms\n• 15-780: Graduate Artificial Intelligence\n• 36-707: Regression Analysis\n• 36-709: Advanced Statistical Theory I\n• 36-710: Advanced Statistical Theory II\n• An additional course from the menu core list above.\n• Any course at the 700 or higher level in SCS or Statistics (36-xxx).\n• Other 700 or higher level courses by approval.",

      "content": "Course Requirements The curriculum for the ML Masters is built on a foundation of five core courses and two electives (plus the Data Analysis Project requirement). The ML curriculum joins courses with a Computer Science main theme and those with a Probability and Statistics main theme. These may be grouped, as follows: In CS, relevant sub-fields include: Databases; Machine Learning, Data Mining and algorithms applications in areas such as Robotics, Information Retrieval and AI. In Statistics (including Philosophy), the sub-fields include: Statistical modeling (e.g., hierarchical and times series); Bayes' Nets, Causation, and experimental design. The curriculum is based on core academic courses on Intermediate Statistics, Machine Learning, Statistical Machine Learning, Multimedia Databases, and Algorithms. The five core courses provide, respectively: a secure foundation in mathematical statistics, a survey of basic machine learning techniques with numerous applications; the statistical and probabilistic theoretical underpinnings for these techniques; an introduction to databases for data mining, and a study of advanced algorithms.\nPlus any two of the following:\nData Analysis Project Requirement, in the second year, which serves in lieu of an MS thesis.\nThe two electives may be chosen from the List of electives. Other electives may be considered after consultation with the student's advisor and if approved by the co-directors.\nDouble Counting Courses: Any course counted toward another master-level degree may not be counted toward our Master in Machine Learning.\nThe Data Analysis Project requirement: The final requirement is for the student to demonstrate data mining skills in the context of a focused project. The Data Analysis Project (DAP) may be carried out either at Carnegie Mellon or at a sponsoring corporate institution under the joint supervision of the sponsor and a ML faculty. It will be concluded by a written report (in lieu of a Masters Thesis) in which the student demonstrates an ability to approach data mining problems in a way that cuts across existing disciplinary boundaries. The requirement includes a presentation in the ML Journal Club and also the submission of a DAP Paper. Passing this requirement will be the judgment of the DAP committee. Student must form an official \"DAP committee\" of three faculty to evaluate the document. The committee will consist of the advisor, the Journal club instructor(s), and one other faculty member selected by the student. The third member is typically someone with an interest in the analysis of the data set, and does not have to be an expert in ML or part of the student's thesis committee.The student should form the committee as early as possible during the DAP research process, and inform Diane of who the members are. Two faculty from the committee are required to attend the presentation.\nThis Research page is a list of some of the projects for which ML faculty may be interested in recruiting students. Within each project there can be lines of research which range in size from a semester's work to an entire thesis (or beyond). So, this page is intended as a resource for students looking for a thesis advisor, for a Data Analysis Project (DAP), or to collaborate for any other reason.\n• 10-701 Machine Learning\n• 10-702 Statistical Machine Learning\n• 36-705 Intermediate Statistics\n• 10-708 Probablistic Graphical Models\n• 10-725 Convex Optimization\n• 15-826 Multimedia Databases and Data Mining\n• 15-750 Algorithms or 15-853 Algorithms in the Real World",

In the second year, the student will typically be supported by a research grant to a faculty member, who would become the adviser.\nThe PNC/ML Joint program requires four core courses from the CNBC and five core courses from the Machine Learning Department.\nStudents must take at least one of the following courses:\nStudents must also gain training in cell and molecular neuroscience/neurophysiology, systems neuroscience,and cognitive science by taking the following courses:\nStudents must take the following classes:\nAnd any two of the following:\nStudents in the program spend significant time in the lab of one or more experimentalists to gain a detailed understanding of how experimental data are collected. Students working in a strictly computational lab are required to do a rotation of at least 10 weeks in an experimental lab with the intent to begin (or continue) a collaboration with that lab.\nNote: The experimental rotation may serve as a major component of either the first-year or second-year research requirement.\nIt is crucial that students develop the ability to communicate effectively, both orally and in writing. Practice speaking will occur during journal clubs and related presentations. In addition, the two research requirements involve both oral and written work.\nBy the end of the first calendar year in the program, all students are required to have completed a data-analytic project. The purpose of the project is to have the student identify a biological problem, understand the data collection process, articulate the goals of building a model or performing a particular kind of analysis, and implement this computational approach.\nAll students are required to complete a deeper computational project. The student's work on the project should demonstrate that the student has 1) the ability to analyze and interpret experimental data in a particular area; 2) the ability to develop and implement a computational approach incorporating the relevant level of biological detail; and 3) the ability to organize, interpret and present the results of the computational work. This project should be a body of work suitable for publication.\nRequired coursework should be completed by the end of the third year. During the fourth year, a Ph.D. candidate should present a thesis proposal first to his or her thesis committee and then to the CNBC and MLD community.\nNormally the dissertation is completed during the student's fifth year.\n• Math 3375: Computational Neuroscience (University of Pittsburgh)\n• 15-833: Computational Models of Neural Systems (CMU)\n• 36-759: Statistical Models of the Brain

Similarly, this program differs from the Statistics Ph.D. program in its emphasis on machine learning and computer science. (See below for more details on the course requirements.)\nStudents in this track will be involved in courses and research from both the Departments of Statistics and Machine Learning. During the first year, students will normally be situated in the Department of Statistics. During later years, students will normally be located in the Machine Learning Department, unless the primary adviser is in the Department of Statistics. In years two and beyond, thesis research is co-supervised by a faculty in machine learning and a faculty in statistics, or supervised by a faculty member with a joint appointment. The thesis committee must contain at least one member with a home department of statistics and one with home department of machine learning.\nThe typical curriculum schedule is outlined below.\nImportant Notes\nOne of the following courses:\n• 10- designates a machine learning course; 15- designates a computer science course; and 36- designates a statistics course.\n• * indicates a course that is in the joint program but not in the machine learning Ph.D. program.\n• # indicates a course that is in the joint program but not in the statistics Ph.D. program.\n• Generally, the courses marked with an * or # replace electives in the machine learning Ph.D. program.

Therefore, you should be registered for at least 24 units of 10-920: Reading and Research each semester. Once you have completed your core courses and electives, then your research units increase to a total of 48 units each semester. Once you propose, you should register for 10-930: Dissertation Research instead of Reading and Research. Register for classes on CMU's Student Information Online portal.\nYou can add or drop a class in your schedule until 10 days after classes begin. After that, you will need to see the Ph.D. Program Manager for help making adjustments to your schedule.\nSend email to the Ph.D. Program Manager to request an increase in your maximum units if you are having trouble registering for classes.\nBefore opting to audit a course, you first need to actually register for it. Then, fill out the course audit form and have your adviser and the course instructor sign it to indicate their permission. Submit the signed form to the Ph.D. Program Manager for school signature and submission to Enrollment Services.\nAny course at the 700 or higher level in SCS or Statistics (36-xxx) may be used as an elective. Any other electives must be approved by your adviser via email to the Ph.D. Program Manager.\nTo satisfy the Presentation Skills requirement, students must give a talk that is at least 30 minutes long and invite members of the Speaking Skills Committee to attend and evaluate it. Be sure to fill out the speaking skills form.\nIn order to satisfy the Writing Skills requirement, the student must be the first author on a paper. The quality of the paper must be such that if submitted to a major conference or journal it has the possibility of acceptance. It doesn't have to actually be submitted. The student must have a Review Committee of two reviewers: one faculty member from Carnegie Mellon (it may be the faculty adviser) and one Ph.D. student who is not a paper co-author. If the faculty reviewer is a co-author, they must explicitly indicate the student’s contribution to the writing. The Review Committee fills out the writing skills review form and must unanimously approve the paper to satisfy the requirement. If the student fails, the evaluators provide guidance on necessary revisions and the student tries again.\nA machine learning Ph.D. student may waive the writing skill requirement if the student already has a first author paper accepted at a top ML conference/journal, since these papers already went through peer review. Accepted conferences: AISTATS, AAAI, COLT, ICML, KDD, NeurIPS, etc. Journals: JMLR. To waive the Writing Skills requirement based on this criterion, fill out the writing skills waiver form and send to your program coordinator.\nYou are required to TA two courses in MLD while you are in your Ph.D. program.\nThe MLD Ph.D. TA requirement will only count if you TA'd for a MLD course while you were a Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon.\nYou should not plan on TAing a course until at least your second year.\nFill out the application form.\nTo apply to TA an MLD course, simply fill out the TA application form. We look forward to receiving your application!\nIf a Ph.D. student wants to attend a conference or workshop, the student's adviser or research sponsor should support the trip through either a research contract or a discretionary account. Student travel is unlimited as long as there is money available from research contracts and/or discretionary funds of a sponsoring faculty member.\nIf no such funding is available to the student, then limited departmental funds may be available upon request from the Machine Learning Department. Since departmental funds are limited, the maximum to be reimbursed will be $200 plus the registration fee, if only attending the conference or workshop; $600 plus the registration fee, if presenting a paper. Department funding is only available to the student for one trip per year and will not be transferred to the following year. This funding is only available if the adviser agrees with the student's decision to attend the conference but does not have the funds.\nTo obtain travel support, the Ph.D. student and their faculty adviser/research sponsor must first agree that the student should take the trip. In advance of the trip, the student must fill out and print the student travel authorization form and get their adviser's signature before forwarding the form to the Ph.D. Programs Administrator.\nThe faculty member must (i) indicate the amount and the reason for providing partial support (be sure the charge number is filled in) or (ii) state on the Comments line that no funds are available from any research or discretional account. The student then submits the form to the Ph.D. Programs Administrator to request approval from the Department Head.\nCMU may also be able to help with conference funding and has a page devoted to information about conference funding for graduate students. Visit the university's Office of Graduate and Postdoctoral Affairs page for more information and additional resources.\nTo extend your summer internship beyond the approved end date, you must return to campus and continue your internship remotely and work only up to an average of eight hours per week. In the department, we consider this consulting. The dates of the internship must be within the semester dates. You need to do the following to ensure the internship is extended correctly:\nInternational students must apply for part-time CPT and register for eight units of 10-935: Practicum. You will also need a letter from your summer internship employer including start and end dates, hours per week and the rate of pay. Send the CPT form to your Ph.D. Program Manager for signature.\nMLD Ph.D. students enrolled in our program and funded by research grants, fellowships or other funding mechanisms are expected to spend all their work time on academic activities toward completing their degrees. Outside paid work is not normally compatible with full time Ph.D. student status. However, in some circumstances the Machine Learning Department may permit full-time Ph.D. students to devote up to eight hours per week (averaged over any one semester) to outside, paid professional activities, where that activity is consistent with the student’s role as a member of the student body, and where that activity also enhances the contribution of the student to the university.\nTo obtain that permission, a student must apply ahead of time by filling out the Ph.D. student consulting policy and agreement form. The consulting start and end dates must be within the semester dates. Of course, the student must also make sure they comply with all applicable U.S. laws, including specific terms of their visa, if applicable.\nInternational Students will have to contact OIE and fill out the CPT form.\nYou should complete all of your courses before proposing your thesis. You should also have satisfied the Speaking Skills, Writing and Teaching Assistant requirements before you propose. Discuss your plan to propose with your adviser for timing feedback.\nThe Thesis Committee should be assembled by the student and their adviser, and approved by the Ph.D. Program Director(s). It must include:\nTo learn more and apply for OPT, visit the Office of International Education website.\nIf you are graduating in May and plan to attend the May commencement ceremony, then your final thesis has to be turned in two weeks before the May Black Friday meeting.\nIf graduating in August or December, you must have your final thesis turned in on the last day of the month following your defense semester end. If you defend in the summer, then your final thesis has to be turned in two weeks before fall classes start. If you defend during the fall semester, check with your Program Administrator about important dates throughout the semester.\nThe final thesis must have the approval from all your committee members and your adviser must send email to the Graduate Program Administrator as a confirmation of approval.\nSend questions about diplomas to uro-diplomas@andrew.cmu.edu.\nFor PackagesAndrew ID: - SCS/MLDWean Hall - Receiving - Room 3613311 Hamerschlag DrivePittsburgh, PA 15213United States\nFor Regular MailYour NameSchool of Computer Science – MLD [Omit this line if necessary]Carnegie Mellon University – GHC 80094902 Forbes Ave.Pittsburgh, PA 15213\n• Fill out the Ph.D. student consulting policy and agreement form, have your advisor sign it, and send to the Ph.D. Director for approval.\n• Register for eight units of 10-935: Practicum.\n• At least one MLD core faculty member.\n• At least one additional MLD core or affiliated faculty member.\n• At least one external member (usually meaning external to CMU).\n• A total of at least four members, including the adviser, who is the committee chair.\n• Before you submit the final copy:\nCheck research credits with Russ O'Lare.Get a Technical Report number from the Graduate Program Administrator.Check for proper title page format.\n• Check research credits with Russ O'Lare.\n• Get a Technical Report number from the Graduate Program Administrator.\n• Check for proper title page format.\n• When the final copy is ready:\nHave the chair of the Thesis Committee send email to confirm the approval of the final thesis document to the Graduate Program Administrator.Send the final document to the Graduate Program Administrator.Complete the dissertation checklist and send to the Graduate Program Administrator.Fill out the Survey of Earned Doctorates.\n• Have the chair of the Thesis Committee send email to confirm the approval of the final thesis document to the Graduate Program Administrator.\n• Send the final document to the Graduate Program Administrator.\n• Complete the dissertation checklist and send to the Graduate Program Administrator.\n• Fill out the Survey of Earned Doctorates.\n• Check research credits with Russ O'Lare.\n• Get a Technical Report number from the Graduate Program Administrator.\n• Check for proper title page format.\n• Have the chair of the Thesis Committee send email to confirm the approval of the final thesis document to the Graduate Program Administrator.\n• Send the final document to the Graduate Program Administrator.\n• Complete the dissertation checklist and send to the Graduate Program Administrator.\n• Fill out the Survey of Earned Doctorates.\n• Check that your diploma name is correct in SIO under \"Graduation and Diploma.\" Students who fail to update their name before the diploma order will have to pay for a replacement.\n• All August diplomas are mailed to graduates and are not held for commencement, so we need a valid (non-CMU) address to mail the diploma.

All four “introduction” courses have a similar goal: to introduce students to the theory and practice of machine learning. That is, students who take these courses will be able to:\nThe courses differ, however, in their assumed background, relative emphasis on these goals and pace. This page is intended to help students choose which course is right for them.\nFor information about timing, please see the Schedule of Classes or Student Information Online.\nIf you are a student in one of the following programs, we recommend:\nMost advanced machine learning courses will accept any of these courses as a prerequisite. However, most students in the 700-level advanced machine learning courses (e.g. 10-703, 10-707, 10-708) will have taken 10-701 or 10-715. Most students in the 600-level advanced ML courses (e.g. 10-605, 10-617, 10-618) will have taken 10-601. Most students in the 400-level advanced ML courses (e.g. 10-403, 10-405, 10-417) will have taken 10-301 or 10-315.\nStudents choosing between 10-601 and 10-701 (e.g., non-MLD SCS M.S. students), may want to gauge their own mathematical preparedness  to choose between the two courses.\nIf you have completed a full-semester undergraduate course on all of the following topics, you are likely prepared for 10-701:\nIf you have not completed all of the above coursework as an undergraduate, then we recommend 10-601. Undergraduates taking 10-301, which is crosslisted with 10-601 and has the same content, will have completed a full semester course on each of the following topics:\nThis course is intended for Ph.D. students in the Machine Learning Department. It is the fastest-paced and most mathematical of the courses. 10-715 is intended to prepare students to write research papers that rely on and contribute to machine learning. Ph.D. students from closely-related departments (such as the Computer Science Department or Robotics Institute) might consider this course if their research depends strongly on and contributes to machine learning. Master's students in MLD have the option of taking 10-715 or 10-701. It is not offered to undergraduate students.\nThis course is intended for Ph.D. students with strong mathematical and programming backgrounds. It focuses more on the mathematical foundations of machine learning than on applications. Students must be comfortable writing proofs. It is typically the appropriate course for Ph.D. students in SCS departments other than machine learning, or for MLD master's students. Ph.D. students from outside SCS could consider 10-701 if they have a strong background in math and programming, including linear algebra, probability and matrix calculus. To gain the required background, non-MLD SCS master's students may take one or both minis of 10-606/607 then 10-701.\nThis course is intended for undergraduates in SCS. Unlike 10-301, the course is not paced to allow students with incomplete backgrounds to catch up; however, students who do well in the prerequisite and corequisite courses will have sufficient background to do well in 10-315. Because one of the main audiences for this course are AI majors who have taken 15-281: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, this course typically does not cover certain topics introduced in 15-281, such as reinforcement learning and Bayesian networks.\nStudents in this course have the most diverse collection of backgrounds. The most typical student is a master's student from SCS or a non-SCS undergraduate, but the course is intended to allow students from anywhere in the university to catch up and do well — including those whose mathematical backgrounds may be rusty or incomplete. However, the course is mathematically rigorous and contains both programming and derivations in its homeworks, so students should expect to do extra work in proportion to the amount of background they are missing. Compared to 10-701, this class is more focused on practical applications and is appropriate for a student who wants to take just one machine learning class at CMU.

The minor in machine learning allows undergraduates to learn about the core principles of the field.\nThe Machine Learning Minor is open to undergraduate students in any major at Carnegie Mellon University outside the School of Computer Science. (SCS students should instead consider the Machine Learning Concentration.) Students should apply for admission at least one semester before their expected graduation date, but are encouraged to apply as soon as they have taken the prerequisite classes for the minor. Grades from the core courses are also welcomed with the application. An admission decision will usually be made within one month.\nAll courses for the ML minor, including prerequisites, must be passed with a C or better.\nNo course in the machine learning minor may be counted toward another SCS minor. Additionally, at least three courses (each being at least nine units) must be used for only the machine learning minor, not for any other major, minor or concentration. (These double-counting restrictions apply specifically to the core courses and the electives. Prerequisites may be counted toward other majors, minors and concentrations and do not count toward the three courses that must be used for only the machine learning minor.)\nStudents pursuing a machine learning minor take two core courses that provide a foundation in the field. They include:\nThe Machine Learning Minor requires at least three elective courses of at least nine units each in machine learning. Students may select one of the following options to satisfy the electives requirement:\nStudents should note that some of these elective courses (those at the 600-level and higher) are primarily aimed at graduate students, and so should make sure that they are adequately prepared for them before enrolling.\nGraduate-level cross-listings of these courses can also be used for the ML minor, if the student is adequately prepared for the more advanced version and the home department approves the student's registration.\nNote: Courses must come from separate lines in the list above. For example, if 10-417: Intermediate Deep Learning is used for the ML minor, 11-485: Introduction to Deep Learning cannot be used for the ML minor.\nNote: Courses must come from separate lines in the list above. For example, if 36-700: Probability and Mathematical Statistics is used for the ML minor, 36-705: Intermediate Statistics cannot be used for the ML minor.\nThe CS Senior Honors Thesis consists of 36 units of academic credit, usually under the course number 07-599: SCS Honors Undergraduate Research Thesis. Up to 24 units (12 units each semester) may be counted toward the ML minor. Students must consult with the Computer Science Department for information about the CS Senior Honors Thesis. Once both student and adviser agree upon a project, the student should submit a one-page research proposal to the Machine Learning Concentration Director to confirm that the project will count for the machine learning concentration.\nSenior research consists of two semesters of 10-500: Senior Research Project, totaling 24 units and counting as two electives.\nThe research must be a yearlong senior project, supervised or co-supervised by a machine learning core faculty or affiliated faculty member. It is almost always conducted as two semesterlong projects, and must be done in senior year.\nInterested students should contact the faculty they wish to advise them to discuss the research project before the semester in which research will take place.

Graduates of the machine learning Ph.D. program are uniquely positioned to pioneer new developments in the field and to be leaders in both industry and academia.\nUnderstanding the most effective ways to use the vast amount of data now being stored is a significant challenge to society — and therefore to science and technology — as it seeks to obtain a return on the huge investment being made in computerization and data collection. Advances in the development of automated techniques for data analysis and decision-making require interdisciplinary work in areas such as machine learning algorithms and foundations, statistics, complexity theory, optimization, data mining, and more.\nThe Ph.D. Program in Machine Learning is for students interested in machine learning research. Contact us with questions and concerns.\nThe Ph.D. program is a full-time, in-person commitment and is not offered online or part-time.\nIn addition to meeting the requirements indicated here, students must also follow all university policies and procedures.\nPh.D. students are required to serve as teaching assistants for two semesters in machine learning courses (10-xxx), beginning in their second year. This fulfills their teaching skills requirement.\nDuring their second or third year, Ph.D. students must give a talk at least 30 minutes long and invite members of the Speaking Skills committee to attend and evaluate it.\nIt is expected that all Ph.D. students engage in active research beginning in their first semester. Moreover, adviser selection occurs within the first month of entering the Ph.D. program, with the option to change at a later time. Roughly half of a student's time should be allocated to research and lab work, and half to courses (until the courses are completed).\nStudents must work with their adviser to form their Thesis Committee. We've outline the rules for this committee below. (These rules apply to all ML Ph.D. students.) Your committee must include the following and be approved by the Ph.D. Program Director(s):\nIt will be our responsibility, not yours, to worry about your tuition and stipend while you are in our program. We are committed to providing you with full tuition and stipend support for the coming academic year. We intend to continue this support as long as you make satisfactory progress in our program. Students who do not have external financial support will be funded via graduate assistantships, awarded for a nine-month period from September to May, which would normally come from their adviser’s grants. Because of that, specific research opportunities may be constrained by funding availability. Students who have partial external financial support will be supplemented to bring them to the full level of support, and often receive an additional supplement on top of that. If you have dependents, we will also pay you a dependency allowance that is 10% of the MLD monthly base stipend per eligible dependent, unless you have a spouse or qualifying domestic partner who earns more than $500 per month.\nThe committee uses GRE scores to gauge quantitative skills, and to a lesser extent, also verbal skills.\nIf you will be studying on an F-1 or J-1 visa, and English is not your native language (\"native language\" meaning spoken at home and from birth), we are required to formally evaluate your English proficiency. We require applicants who will be studying on an F-1 or J-1 visa, and for whom English is not a native language, to demonstrate English proficiency via one of these standardized tests: TOEFL (preferred), IELTS or Duolingo.\nWe do not issue waivers for nonnative speakers of English. In particular, we do not issue waivers based on previous study at a U.S. high school, college or university. We also do not issue waivers based on previous study at an English-language high school, college or university outside the United States. No amount of educational experience in English, regardless of which country it occurred in, will result in a test waiver.\nAdditional details about English proficiency requirements are provided on the  FAQ  page.\n• Completion of required courses (six core courses + one elective).\n• Mastery of proficiencies in teaching and presentation skills.\n• Successful defense of a Ph.D. thesis.\n• At least one MLD core faculty member.\n• At least one additional MLD core or affiliated faculty member.\n• At least one external member, usually external to CMU.\n• A total of at least four members, including the adviser who is the committee chair.\n• SCS Graduate Admissions Overview\n• SCS Graduate Application Instructions\n• Frequently Asked Questions\n• Admissions application opens Sept. 3, 2025\n• Early Application Deadline: Nov. 19, 2025 (3 p.m. EST)\n• Final Application Deadline: Dec. 10, 2025 (3 p.m. EST)\n• If you submit your application early, your recommenders still have until Dec. 10, 2025 to submit recommendations.",

When will I hear back?\n[HEADING] Where can I find more information about the program?\nThe Master's in Machine Learning: Applied Study program is intended for applicants who are not integrating the master's in machine learning into their CMU bachelor's degree. CMU undergraduates are encouraged to consider the 5th-Year Master's in Machine Learning program, but are welcome to apply to this 16-month program instead. The Master's in Machine Learning: Applied Study is only available in a stand-alone master's format and cannot be integrated into a bachelor's degree.\nThe curriculum for the Master's in Machine Learning: Applied Study requires six core courses, three electives, an internship and professional development. The coursework component is the same between different versions of the master's. Refer to the Machine Learning Master's Curriculum for full information.\nThe M.S. in Machine Learning: Applied Study does not provide financial support and the student must pay tuition, student fees and living expenses on their own.\nSee the financial information page for costs.\nThe Machine Learning Department uses the School of Computer Science (SCS) Graduate Online Application. You may apply for multiple programs at Carnegie Mellon and the Machine Learning Department's M.S. Admissions Committee will consider your application independently.\nApplications are accepted only once a year. All students begin the program in August, having applied the previous December.\nFor application information, including application deadlines, refer to the SCS Master's Admissions and SCS Master's Admissions FAQ pages.\nWe welcome applicants from a variety of backgrounds and an undergraduate degree in computer science is not required.\nIncoming students must have a strong background in computer science, including a solid understanding of complexity theory and good programming skills, as well as a good background in mathematics. Specifically, the first-year courses assume at least one year of college-level probability and statistics, as well as matrix algebra and multivariate calculus.\nFor our introductory machine learning course, our self-assessment test will give you some idea of the background we expect students to have. (For the master's, you're looking at the \"modest requirements.\") Generally, you need to have some reasonable programming skills, with experience in Matlab/R/scipy-numpy being especially helpful; Java and Python being more useful than C; and a solid math background, especially in probability/statistics, linear algebra, and matrix and tensor calculus.\nThe average scores of accepted applicants for the M.S. in Machine Learning: Applied Study for fall 2025 were as follows:\nScores vary significantly and are only a small portion of applicants' qualifications. We do take people with a range of backgrounds for the master's program.\nFor information about our selectivity rate and other statistics, refer to the comparison PDF of all SCS master's programs.\nFor applicants applying to the MS in Machine Learning - Applied Study program in Fall 2025 for a start date of August 2026, GRE scores are optional.We do not require or expect applicants to take a GRE Subject Test.\nNo. At this time, we do not offer online or distance-learning classes. You must be physically present in Pittsburgh and able to attend classes on campus to complete the program.\nYes, you can study part-time as long as you can attend the classes, which are generally held during the day on weekdays.\nInternational students should be aware that student visas require students to complete the program full-time and finish the program by the end of their third semester (in December).\nNo. Applications are accepted only in December and students must begin the program the following August. We cannot make exceptions to this due to the timing of our set core courses.\nNo. You may not simply transfer into our program. You must submit an application and be accepted into the program, following the same application procedure as other applicants. Furthermore, the program does not accept transfer credit from other universities, although in certain situations a specific course requirement may be waived and an additional elective may be taken in its place.\nCurrent CMU undergraduates may be able to apply for the 5th-Year Master's in Machine Learning, which begins immediately after they have completed their bachelor's degree. However, note that the Master's in Machine Learning: Applied Study is not available as a fifth-year master's.\nYes, we welcome applicants from all backgrounds. As with all applicants, make sure that your statement of purpose makes it clear why you believe an additional master's degree will help you achieve your goals.\nSCS has compiled a comparison of all its master's programs, including a PDF that compares program outcomes, average applicant scores and selectivity rates.\nThe Master's in Machine Learning: Applied Study is similar to the Master's in Machine Learning program. The applied study degree is ideal for students interested in a career in industry, with students regularly engaging in professional development outside the classroom and gaining experience working with industry employers during the summer. In comparison, the master's in machine learning allows students to spend more time on research within an academic environment.\nThe Career and Professional Development Center compiles post-graduate salaries and destination information about all graduates. While the Master's in Machine Learning: Applied Study program only began in 2020, you can see information about the original Master's in Machine Learning program there.\nThe application deadline can be found on the SCS Master's Admissions page. It changes from year to year, but is generally in late November or early December. You should expect an email response sometime in February. If you apply to multiple programs, you should expect to receive separate responses from each.\nYou can find additional information in the Machine Learning Master's Handbook.\n• Preparation for internship search.\n• 10-701: Intro to Machine Learning\n• 36-700: Statistics\n• One Elective\n• Professional Development\n• Internship Search\n• Two Core Courses\n• One Elective\n• Professional Development\n• Internship Search\n• Internship Related to Machine Learning\n• 10-718: Machine Learning in Practice\n• One Core Course\n• One Elective\n• Professional Development\n• Job Search\n• Undergraduate Overall GPA: 3.9/4.0 or 9.5/10.0.\n• GRE Quantitative: 169 (88th percentile)\n• GRE Verbal: 160 (80th percentile)\n• GRE Analytical Writing: 4.1 (63rd percentile)\n• TOEFL: 111\n[GRID_TABLE]\nThe curriculum for the Master's in Machine Learning: Applied Study requires six core courses, three electives, an internship and professional development.

The Minor in Machine Learning allows undergraduates to learn about the core principles of machine learning.\nThe curriculum varies based on when students began their undergraduate program at CMU:\nCurriculum for 2018 and earlierCurriculum for 2019 and later\nStudents within the School of Computer Science can add the Machine Learning Concentration to their major to enhance their computer science education.\nThe curriculum for the master's degree in machine learning requires six core courses, three elective courses and a practicum.\nM.S. students take all six core courses:\nNote: The core courses must be taken from separate lines. For example, a student may not use both 10-703: Deep Reinforcement Learning and 10-707: Topics in Deep Learning to satisfy their core requirements.\nStudents take their choice of three elective courses (from separate lines):\nIf a student takes both 10-703: Deep Reinforcement Learning and 10-707: Advanced Deep Learning, one will count for the core and the other will count as an elective.\nA student may fulfill one, two, or three electives with Independent Study, if desired. The most common arrangement is one research project conducted over two semesters (counting as two electives), since it takes time to get up to speed on a new research project. But a project may be as short as one semester or as long as three semesters plus the summer practicum. Depending on the project(s), it's possible to do research under different faculty in different semesters, but only one independent study can be completed at a time.\nMultiple Special Topics in Machine Learning courses can be used as electives; it is not limited to one Special Topics course per student. These courses will generally have 10-XXX course numbers, but not all 10-XXX courses are approved as electives. To know if a specific course counts as an elective, consult the list below or email the MSML Programs Manager.\nM.S. students also complete a one-semester, full-time practicum (an internship or research related to machine learning), generally during the summer.\n• 10-701: Introduction to Machine Learning or 10-715: Advanced Introduction to Machine Learning\n• 10-617: Intermediate Deep Learning or 10-703: Deep Reinforcement Learning or 10-707: Advanced Deep Learning\n• 10-708: Probabilistic Graphical Models\n• 10-718: Machine Learning in Practice\n• 10-725: Optimization for Machine Learning (formerly Convex Optimization)\n• 36-700: Probability and Mathematical Statistics or 36-705: Intermediate Statistics\n• 10-605/10-805: Machine Learning With Large Datasets10-703: Deep Reinforcement Learning or 10-707: Advanced Deep Learning10-716: Advanced Machine Learning —Theory and Methods10-???: Special Topics in Machine Learning (course numbers vary)11-711: Advanced Natural Language Processing11-741: Machine Learning With Graphs11-747: Neural Networks for NLP11-777: Multimodal Machine Learning15-750: Algorithms in the Real World or 15-850: Advanced Algorithms or 15-853: Algorithms in the Real World15-780: Graduate Artificial Intelligence15-826: Multimedia Databases and Data Mining16-720: Computer Vision or 16-820: Advanced Computer Vision36-707: Regression Analysis36-709: Advanced Statistical Theory I36-710: Advanced Statistical Theory II10-620: Independent Study with an ML core faculty member10-620 Independent Study with an ML core faculty member10-620 Independent Study with an ML core faculty member\n• 10-605/10-805: Machine Learning With Large Datasets\n• 10-703: Deep Reinforcement Learning or 10-707: Advanced Deep Learning\n• 10-716: Advanced Machine Learning —Theory and Methods\n• 10-???: Special Topics in Machine Learning (course numbers vary)\n• 11-711: Advanced Natural Language Processing\n• 11-741: Machine Learning With Graphs\n• 11-747: Neural Networks for NLP\n• 11-777: Multimodal Machine Learning\n• 15-750: Algorithms in the Real World or 15-850: Advanced Algorithms or 15-853: Algorithms in the Real World\n• 15-780: Graduate Artificial Intelligence\n• 15-826: Multimedia Databases and Data Mining\n• 16-720: Computer Vision or 16-820: Advanced Computer Vision\n• 36-707: Regression Analysis\n• 36-709: Advanced Statistical Theory I\n• 36-710: Advanced Statistical Theory II\n• 10-620: Independent Study with an ML core faculty member\n• 10-620 Independent Study with an ML core faculty member\n• 10-620 Independent Study with an ML core faculty member\n• 10-605/10-805: Machine Learning With Large Datasets\n• 10-703: Deep Reinforcement Learning or 10-707: Advanced Deep Learning\n• 10-716: Advanced Machine Learning —Theory and Methods\n• 10-???: Special Topics in Machine Learning (course numbers vary)\n• 11-711: Advanced Natural Language Processing\n• 11-741: Machine Learning With Graphs\n• 11-747: Neural Networks for NLP\n• 11-777: Multimodal Machine Learning\n• 15-750: Algorithms in the Real World or 15-850: Advanced Algorithms or 15-853: Algorithms in the Real World\n• 15-780: Graduate Artificial Intelligence\n• 15-826: Multimedia Databases and Data Mining\n• 16-720: Computer Vision or 16-820: Advanced Computer Vision\n• 36-707: Regression Analysis\n• 36-709: Advanced Statistical Theory I\n• 36-710: Advanced Statistical Theory II\n• 10-620: Independent Study with an ML core faculty member\n• 10-620 Independent Study with an ML core faculty member\n• 10-620 Independent Study with an ML core faculty member\n• 10-613/10-713: Machine Learning Ethics and Society (fall 2021, spring 2023)\n• 10-623: Generative AI (spring 2024, fall 2024, spring 2025, fall 2025)\n• 10-624: Bayesian Methods in Machine Learning (spring 2025)\n• 10-643/-743 Socio-technical Evaluations of Generative AI (fall 2025)\n• 10-714: Deep Learning Systems — Algorithms and Implementation (fall 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025)\n• 10-717: The Art of the Paper (spring 2022; 6 units = 1/2 Elective)\n• 10-719: Federated and Collaborative Learning (fall 2023)\n• 10-721: Philosophical Foundations of Machine Intelligence (fall 2021; 6 units = 1/2 elective)\n• 10-726 Machine Learning Theory: The Art of Problem Formulation and Theorem Proving (fall 2025)\n• 10-730: Advanced AI and Brain Seminar (spring 2021; 6 units = 1/2 elective)\n• 10-732: Robustness and Adaptation in Shifting Environments (fall 2022)\n• 10-733: Representation and Generation in Neuroscience and AI (spring 2024, spring 2025)\n• 10-734: Foundations of Autonomous Decision Making Under Uncertainty (fall 2024, 2025)\n• 10-735: Responsible AI (spring 2024, fall 2024).

The practicum may be paid, with income determined by the company offering the internship. Students should contact the Master's Programs Manager about the tuition implications of taking summer classes or conducting the practicum outside the summer semester.\nThe full-time tuition rate is charged to students taking 36 or more units in a semester. Students taking less than 36 units per semester are considered part-time and are charged per-unit at a proportional rate. Courses are typically 12 units.\nAdditional fees charged by the university can be found on the Student Financial Services website.\nInformation about Student Health Insurance can be found on the Student Health Services website.\nMachine learning master's students must also provide their own laptops.\nThe Machine Learning Department does not provide financial aid.\nMany organizations award external scholarships for Carnegie Mellon students. U.S. citizens may also finance the cost of education through government-secured Stafford Loans.\nAll applicants may be interested in the Fellowships and Scholarships Office. The School of Computer Science also maintains a list of Graduate Fellowship Opportunities that may be of particular interest to SCS graduate students.\nStudents may be able to work for the university in some capacity. Employment is generally available only to students already on campus. Teaching assistantships are sometimes available to students. Generally, these assistantships are only available after the first semester and cover only a small part of the cost of tuition. Working while in the program usually extends the time required to complete the degree. (Fifth-year master's students should note that they are expected to study full-time.)\nSome students are able to pay their tuition in full. This method is the most cost-effective from a long-term standpoint.\nFor more information on graduate student financial aid, please visit the Financial Aid Website.\n[HTML_TABLE]\nYear | Tuition Per Semester | Tuition Per Year* | Tuition Per Unit\n2024/2025 | $28,750 | $57,500 | $799\n2025/2026 | $30,200 | $60,400 | $839",

To earn an M.S. in research from MLD, they must satisfy all the relevant requirements.\nThis Ph.D. program differs from the Machine Learning Ph.D. program in that it places significantly more emphasis on preparation in statistical theory and methodology. Similarly, this program differs from the Statistics Ph.D. program in its emphasis on machine learning and computer science. The Joint Ph.D. Program in Machine Learning and Statistics is aimed at preparing students for academic careers in both computer science and statistics departments at top universities or industry.\nStudents in the program must be advised by a faculty member from the home department along with a core faculty member from the joint department as a co-mentor. Joint statistics-MLD faculty cannot serve both roles. Both faculty members must be identified at the time of admission to the joint program.\nNote: MLD students can apply for this program after they have completed the courses and have a sponsoring faculty in statistics to make the case for admission.\nStatistics Joint Program Requirements\nStatistics Ph.D. Online Application        Machine Learning Ph.D. Online ApplicationFor Statistics Department questions, email admissions@stat.cmu.eduFor Machine Learning Department questions, email ml-phd-admissions@cs.cmu.edu\nThe Joint Ph.D. Program in Machine Learning and Public Policy is operated jointly by faculty in machine learning and CMU's Heinz College (which has schools of public policy, information systems and management).

Interested students apply earlier in their senior year than the standard application deadline and receive the response earlier as well.\nNote: The program is designed for a fall start, but a spring start is possible. If a student will graduate in December instead of May and will enter the Fifth-Year Master's Program in spring instead of fall, they are encouraged to take 36-700 in the fall semester of their senior year as one of the three courses taken as an undergraduate to count toward the master's degree. This provides good preparation for the remaining master's courses and is only offered in the fall. A standard course plan in that case would be 10-301 or 10-701 (or 10-315 + 15-281) no later than junior spring; 36-700 in senior fall; and the third course no later than senior fall.\nStudents can take 10-301 or 10-701 as late as the semester they apply, but should aim to take it during junior year. If taking it in the semester they apply, you should submit your midsemester grades.\nAlternatively, instead of taking 10-301 or 10-701, a student may instead take both 10-315 and 15-281. Together, these two courses can fulfill the Intro to ML requirement. (Note that they will remain listed as 10-315 and 15-281 on the transcript, and the two of them together count as one course for the purpose of the fifth-year master's.)\nApplicants should be aware that only three courses may double-count between the bachelor's and master's degree. Additionally, no courses can be triple-counted, such as being used for a minor, major and the master's. Students will not be required to retake courses, but may need to take additional electives if more than three relevant courses were taken before earning their bachelor's degree.\nApplicants should also be aware that we continually review our program requirements and update them as necessary to ensure an appropriate and up-to-date curriculum. Note that the program requirements applicable to you would be those in effect when your admission offer is made, which are not necessarily those in effect today.\nThe Fifth-Year Master's Program application does not require GRE scores or digital portfolios, and only requires two letters of recommendation instead of three. However, if a student is planning to apply to other graduate programs if they're not admitted to the fifth-year master's, it may be advisable to prepare for those other applications as normal.\nThe tuition and fees for the fifth-year master's are the same as the standard master's degree. Fifth-year master's students are also considered graduate students, not undergraduates, and so should contact Housing Services if they're living on campus and their financial aid provider (if they have one) to learn what effects this may have.\nThe fall 2026 application opens the first week of September. The deadline for students applying is October 27, 2025 at 3 pm EST.\nOnce the application opens you can submit your fall 2026 application via Slate. Select \"2026 SCS MS 5th Year Application.\"\nMost students will apply in the fall of the senior year for entry in fifth-year fall, but there is a spring admissions period for students graduating off-cycle. For example, students graduating a semester early can apply in spring of their junior year for entry in fourth-year spring.\nWe will include a spring deadline when it's available.\nThe application opens approximately one month before the application deadline. For prospective applicants who want to plan ahead, the materials you should prepare include:\nFor the Statement of Purpose, type a concise one-page statement that includes your objective in pursuing a graduate degree in machine learning; your background in particularly relevant fields; any relevant academic or research experience; and any additional information you wish to supply to the admissions committee.\nThe letters of recommendation may be written by anyone who knows you well. If you have done research with a faculty member, a letter of recommendation from them would be ideal, but note that research experience is not required. When you begin your application, the School of Computer Science (SCS) Graduate Online Application will have you enter the names and email addresses of your recommenders, and your recommenders will be emailed personalized links where they will upload their letters of recommendation.\nAll materials must be received by the application deadline for consideration that semester.\nStudents should apply in the semester before they graduate. A student graduating in May should apply in the fall, and a student graduating in December should apply in the spring.\nWe aim to return decisions to applicants approximately 4–6 weeks after they apply.\nThe deadline for admitted applicants to accept or reject our offer of admission is approximately four weeks after receiving the offer.\nThe Fifth-Year Master's Program begins the semester after the student earns their bachelor’s degree. Gap semesters are not allowed.\nStudents who earn their bachelor’s degree in May have the option of completing their practicum in either the summer between their senior and fifth years (leading to a May master’s graduation date) or at the completion of their fifth year (leading to an August master’s graduation date).\nUnfortunately, due to the rules regarding student visas, students in F-1 immigration status earning their bachelor’s degree in May cannot fulfill their practicum by completing an internship in the U.S. They must fulfill the practicum requirement either by engaging in summer research at CMU or by completing a summer internship in their home country (or other, non-U.S. country where they have work authorization).\nStudents in F-1 immigration status who earn their bachelor’s degree in December (and starting their master’s program in the spring) can generally use CPT work benefits to complete their internship in the U.S. in the summer between their two master’s semesters.\nInternational students are encouraged to remain in close consultation with OIE, including notifying them about their plans as soon as they are admitted to the Fifth-Year Master's Program.\nDue to the small size of the program, we do not publish statistics for the Fifth-Year Master's Program. However, the program is at least as competitive as the primary master's program in machine learning. We provide the statistics for successful applicants to that program on the Primary M.S. in Machine Learning page.\nThe Fifth-Year Master's Program application does not include any test scores. However, if a student is planning to apply to other graduate programs if they are not admitted to this one, they should look up what tests are necessary for the programs they would be applying to and take any necessary tests early enough to be eligible to apply to those programs.\nYes, students are welcome to apply to the primary master's program if they are not admitted to the Fifth-Year Master's Program. It is possible to be admitted to the primary master's program even if an application was not accepted for admission to the fifth-year master's. These two application paths have different requirements and are therefore evaluated differently.\nStudents are not allowed to double-count courses between their bachelor’s degree and the primary master's in machine learning, even if they earned their bachelor’s degree at CMU.\nNote that the primarily master's application includes additional components that would need to be prepared in advance of receiving the fifth-year master's decision, such as GRE scores and a third letter of recommendation.\nWe strongly discourage applicants from applying to the Fifth-Year Master's Program twice. The admissions committee’s decision is unlikely to change. In addition, their decision would not be released until shortly before the student would be earning their bachelor’s, leaving them little time to make alternate plans if they aren’t admitted.\nInstead, applicants are welcome to apply to the primary master's program if they are not admitted to the fifth-year program.\nNo, the Fifth-Year Master's Program requires students to take courses in person at the Pittsburgh campus full-time in both the fall and spring semesters.\nThe full-time summer practicum may be completed outside Pittsburgh.\nThe Career and Professional Development Center compiles post-graduate salaries and destination information about all CMU alumni. The data for fifth-year master's alumni is combined with the data for primary machine learning master's alumni.\nFor questions about the Machine Learning Master's Program that have not been answered on our website, contact the Machine Learning Master's Admissions Coordinator Laura Winter.\nLaura also holds office hours during the spring and fall semesters. Times and locations for fall 2025 office hours will be announced when classes begin.\n• Must be graduating with a bachelor's degree from Carnegie Mellon University.\n• Must take precisely three of the M.S. courses during their undergraduate years, passing each with a grade of B or better. (These courses may also count toward the bachelor's degree.)\n• Must take 10-301 or 10-701: Introduction to Machine Learning no later than the semester they apply; or must have taken both 10-315: Introduction to Machine Learning and 15-281: Artificial Intelligence — Representation and Problem Solving. (See \"Recommendations to Prospective Applicants\" below.)\n• Since fifth-year master's students have taken three courses for the master's during their undergraduate years, the fifth-year master's can be completed in two semesters instead of the standard three semesters.\n• Fifth-year master's students must complete the program as full-time students (at least 36 units/semester) for two semesters plus a summer.\n• Courses taken in undergraduate program: 10-301 or 10-701 plus two core or elective courses.\n• Summer between fourth and fifth years: practicum (internship or research related to machine learning).\n• Fall semester: 36-700: Probability and Mathematical Statistics I or 36-705: Intermediate Statistics Statistics; 10-718: Machine Learning in Practice; one core or elective course.\n• Spring semester: three core or elective courses.\n• Statement of Purpose (one page).\n• Resume or CV.\n• CMU unofficial academic record.\n• Mid-semester grades.\n• At least two letters of recommendation.",
