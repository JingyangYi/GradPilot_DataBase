It teaches the advanced techniques and ideas that are being developed in application domains (such as machine learning, verification and computer security) and the rich and diverse theories that underpin them. These include models of computation and data, and mathematical analysis of programs and algorithms.\nThe course aims:\nThe Department of Computer Science is committed to the development and application of effective theory based on realistic practice. The MSc in Advanced Computer Science is heavily informed by the department’s consultation and collaboration with industry, and some of the modules were developed through consultation and collaboration with industry. The department believes that only by the interplay of theory and practice can you be trained properly in such a rapidly advancing subject. Practice alerts us to real contemporary problems - theory is a shield against professional obsolescence.\nEntrants to the course will come from either a computer science or mathematical background. You may be a recent graduate in computer science and will supplement your knowledge with the kind of sound mathematical basis which is not always found in undergraduate courses. If you are a graduate in mathematics you will apply your training in the context of a rigorous application of the fundamental techniques of computer science.\nYou will develop knowledge and understanding of a formal disciplined approach to computer science, a range of relevant concepts, tools and techniques, the principles underpinning these techniques and the ability to apply them in novel situations. On subsequent employment, you will be able to select techniques most appropriate to your working environment, adapt and improve them as necessary, establish appropriate design standards for both hardware and software, train colleagues in the observance of sound practices, and keep abreast of research and development.\nThe academic year is split into three terms of eight weeks but work on the MSc course continues throughout the year and is not restricted just to term time. During the three terms of the course, you will choose from modules on various aspects of computer science. Most modules will last for one term and will be between 16 to 24 lectures. In addition, all modules will have associated classes and some may also have practical sessions (labs) associated with them.\nIn the third term (Trinity term) you will undertake a dissertation. Subject to meeting the relevant requirements (which may depend upon your module choices, dissertation subject and other academic factors), you may have the opportunity to transfer to a specialist stream of the course prior to completing your dissertation: either the MSc Advanced Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence) or the MSc Advanced Computer Science (Foundations of Computer Science).\nA typical week for a student taking three courses in each of the first two terms may be as follows:\nTotal - 35 hours\nThe split of work may differ depending on whether a course has practicals associated with it. This should be taken as a guide only. Examples of modules offered:\nThe options that are offered may vary from year to year as the course develops, and according to the interests of teaching staff. The above examples illustrate the kinds of topics that have been offered recently.\nThe course is full-time and requires attendance in Oxford. Full-time students are subject to the University's Residence requirements.\nAs a graduate student, you will have access to the University's wide range of world-class resources including libraries, museums, galleries, digital resources and IT services.\nThe Bodleian Libraries is the largest library system in the UK. It includes the main Bodleian Library and libraries across Oxford, including major research libraries and faculty, department and institute libraries. Together, the Libraries hold more than 13 million printed items, provide access to e-journals, and contain outstanding special collections including rare books and manuscripts, classical papyri, maps, music, art and printed ephemera.\nThe University's IT Services is available to all students to support with core university IT systems and tools, as well as many other services and facilities. IT Services also offers a range of IT learning courses for students, to support with learning and research.\nThe Department of Computer Science's teaching network comprises over 80 PCs located in the Department of Computer Science and the Practicals Laboratory of the Thom Building, the main building of the Department of Engineering Science. The machines in the Thom Building are mostly used for undergraduate practical sessions, though you may occasionally have a practical session scheduled here.Additionally there is a server-based remote access service available, such as personal laptop at home or through networked computers in college computer rooms.Linux is used throughout the teaching network.\nThe Department of Computer Science Library contains books, monographic series, journals, technical reports and past theses covering the main research interests of the department. It is principally for use by graduate students and staff. You will also be able to access other relevant libraries elsewhere in the University such as the Radcliffe Science Library, the Whitehead Library (at the Mathematical Institute for numerical analysts and formal mathematicians), and the Engineering Science Library (especially for those interested in robotics and machine vision).The Department of Computer Science houses lecture theatres and seminar rooms in which most of the University lectures in Computer Science take place.There are department kitchens on each floor and a central common room where you can meet informally. There is an active social committee organising events for staff, students and families.\nThe allocation of thesis supervision for the course is the responsibility of the Department of Computer Science and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under some circumstances it may be appropriate for a student's thesis work to be supervised by a faculty member outside the department of Computer Science.\nYou will be assigned an initial supervisor on arrival in Oxford whose role is to act as an academic advisor during the first two terms of the course. In the third term, a thesis supervisor will be agreed on.\nFor the taught modules, the mode of assessment shall be either written assignment or written examination, dependent on the module you are taking.\nA dissertation, completed independently under the guidance of an expert supervisor, on a topic of your choice and approved by the supervisor and MSc Course Director will be submitted by the end of the third term (Trinity Term).\nMany past students have progressed to PhD-level studies at leading universities; other have pursued careers in industry.\nThe University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page. However, there may be situations in which it is desirable or necessary for the University to make changes in course provision, either before or after registration. The safety of students, staff and visitors is paramount and major changes to delivery or services may have to be made if a pandemic, epidemic or local health emergency occurs. In addition, in certain circumstances, for example due to visa difficulties or because the health needs of students cannot be met, it may be necessary to make adjustments to course requirements for international study.\nWhere possible your academic supervisor will not change for the duration of your course. However, it may be necessary to assign a new academic supervisor during the course of study or before registration for reasons which might include illness, sabbatical leave, parental leave or change in employment.\nFor further information please see our page on changes to courses and the provisions of the student contract regarding changes to courses.\nThe requirements described below are specific to this course and apply only in the year of entry that is shown.

For the majority of Oxford scholarships, your application will automatically be assessed against the eligibility criteria, without needing to make a separate application. There are further Oxford scholarships available which have additional eligibility criteria and where you are required to submit a separate application. Most scholarships are awarded on the basis of academic merit and/or potential.\nTo ensure that you are considered for Oxford scholarships that require a separate application, for which you may be eligible, use our fees, funding and scholarship search tool to identify these opportunities and find out how to apply. Alongside Oxford scholarships, you should also consider other opportunities for which you may be eligible including a range of external funding, loan schemes for postgraduate study and any other scholarships which may also still be available after the January deadline as listed on our fees, funding and scholarship search tool.\nDetails of college-specific funding opportunities can also be found on individual college websites:\nSelect from the list:\nPlease refer to the College preference section of this page to identify which of the colleges listed above accept students for this course.\nFor the majority of college scholarships, it doesn’t matter which college, if any, you state a preference for in your application. If another college is able to offer you a scholarship, your application can be moved to that college if you accept the scholarship. Some college scholarships may require you to state a preference for that college when you apply, so check the eligibility requirements carefully.\nThe fees for this course are charged on an annual basis.\nCourse fees cover your teaching as well as other academic services and facilities provided to support your studies. Unless specified in the additional information section below, course fees do not cover your accommodation, residential costs or other living costs. They also don’t cover any additional costs and charges that are outlined in the additional information section below.\nCourse fees are payable each year, for the duration of your fee liability (your fee liability is the length of time for which you are required to pay course fees). For courses lasting longer than one year, please be aware that fees will usually increase annually. For details, please see our guidance on changes to fees and charges.\nThe Fees and Funding section of this website provides further information about course fees, including information about fee status and eligibility and your length of fee liability.\nThere are no compulsory elements of this course that entail additional costs beyond fees and living costs. However, as part of your course requirements, you may need to choose a dissertation, a project or a thesis topic. Please note that, depending on your choice of topic and the research required to complete it, you may incur additional expenses, such as travel expenses, research expenses, and field trips. You will need to meet these additional costs, although you may be able to apply for small grants from your department and/or college to help you cover some of these expenses.\nIn addition to your course fees and any additional course-specific costs, you will need to ensure that you have adequate funds to support your living costs for the duration of your course.\nFor the 2025-26 academic year, the range of likely living costs for a single, full-time student is between £1,425 and £2,035 for each month spent in Oxford. We provide the cost per month so you can multiply up by the number of months you expect to live in Oxford. Depending on your circumstances, you may also need to budget for the costs of a student visa and immigration health surcharge and/or living costs for family members or other dependants that you plan to bring with you to Oxford (assuming that dependant visa eligibility criteria are met).\nThe current economic climate and high national rate of inflation make it very hard to estimate potential changes to the cost of living over the next few years. For study in Oxford beyond the 2025-26 academic year, it is suggested that you budget for potential increases in living expenses of around 4% each year – although this rate may vary depending on the national economic situation.

It teaches the advanced techniques and ideas that are being developed in application domains (such as machine learning, verification and computer security) and the rich and diverse theories that underpin them. These include models of computation and data, and mathematical analysis of programs and algorithms.The course aims:to provide a challenging and supportive learning environment that encourages high quality students to reach their full potential, personally and academically;to provide the foundation for a professional career in computing-based industries;to enhance the skills of a professional who is already working in one of these industries;to provide a foundation for research into the theory and computing;to present knowledge, experience, reasoning methods and design and implementation techniques which are robust and forward-looking.The Department of Computer Science is committed to the development and application of effective theory based on realistic practice. The MSc in Advanced Computer Science is heavily informed by the department’s consultation and collaboration with industry, and some of the modules were developed through consultation and collaboration with industry. The department believes that only by the interplay of theory and practice can you be trained properly in such a rapidly advancing subject. Practice alerts us to real contemporary problems - theory is a shield against professional obsolescence.Entrants to the course will come from either a computer science or mathematical background. You may be a recent graduate in computer science and will supplement your knowledge with the kind of sound mathematical basis which is not always found in undergraduate courses. If you are a graduate in mathematics you will apply your training in the context of a rigorous application of the fundamental techniques of computer science.You will develop knowledge and understanding of a formal disciplined approach to computer science, a range of relevant concepts, tools and techniques, the principles underpinning these techniques and the ability to apply them in novel situations. On subsequent employment, you will be able to select techniques most appropriate to your working environment, adapt and improve them as necessary, establish appropriate design standards for both hardware and software, train colleagues in the observance of sound practices, and keep abreast of research and development.Course outlineThe academic year is split into three terms of eight weeks but work on the MSc course continues throughout the year and is not restricted just to term time. During the three terms of the course, you will choose from modules on various aspects of computer science. Most modules will last for one term and will be between 16 to 24 lectures. In addition, all modules will have associated classes and some may also have practical sessions (labs) associated with them. In the third term (Trinity term) you will undertake a dissertation. Subject to meeting the relevant requirements (which may depend upon your module choices, dissertation subject and other academic factors), you may have the opportunity to transfer to a specialist stream of the course prior to completing your dissertation: either the MSc Advanced Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence) or the MSc Advanced Computer Science (Foundations of Computer Science).A typical week for a student taking three courses in each of the first two terms may be as follows:Lectures - eight hoursTutorial classes - three hoursPracticals - four hoursSelf-directed study, including preparatory reading, problem sheets, revision of material - 20 hoursTotal - 35 hoursThe split of work may differ depending on whether a course has practicals associated with it. This should be taken as a guide only. Examples of modules offered:Advanced SecurityComputational BiologyComputational Learning TheoryFoundations of Self-Programming AgentsGeometric Deep LearningGraph Representation LearningProbabilistic Model CheckingDeep Learning in HealthcareQuantum Software The options that are offered may vary from year to year as the course develops, and according to the interests of teaching staff. The above examples illustrate the kinds of topics that have been offered recently.Attendance\n\nThe course is full-time and requires attendance in Oxford.

It teaches the advanced techniques and ideas that are being developed in application domains (such as machine learning, verification and computer security) and the rich and diverse theories that underpin them. These include models of computation and data, and mathematical analysis of programs and algorithms.The course aims:to provide a challenging and supportive learning environment that encourages high quality students to reach their full potential, personally and academically;to provide the foundation for a professional career in computing-based industries;to enhance the skills of a professional who is already working in one of these industries;to provide a foundation for research into the theory and computing;to present knowledge, experience, reasoning methods and design and implementation techniques which are robust and forward-looking.The Department of Computer Science is committed to the development and application of effective theory based on realistic practice. The MSc in Advanced Computer Science is heavily informed by the department’s consultation and collaboration with industry, and some of the modules were developed through consultation and collaboration with industry. The department believes that only by the interplay of theory and practice can you be trained properly in such a rapidly advancing subject. Practice alerts us to real contemporary problems - theory is a shield against professional obsolescence.Entrants to the course will come from either a computer science or mathematical background. You may be a recent graduate in computer science and will supplement your knowledge with the kind of sound mathematical basis which is not always found in undergraduate courses. If you are a graduate in mathematics you will apply your training in the context of a rigorous application of the fundamental techniques of computer science.You will develop knowledge and understanding of a formal disciplined approach to computer science, a range of relevant concepts, tools and techniques, the principles underpinning these techniques and the ability to apply them in novel situations. On subsequent employment, you will be able to select techniques most appropriate to your working environment, adapt and improve them as necessary, establish appropriate design standards for both hardware and software, train colleagues in the observance of sound practices, and keep abreast of research and development.Course outlineThe academic year is split into three terms of eight weeks but work on the MSc course continues throughout the year and is not restricted just to term time. During the three terms of the course, you will choose from modules on various aspects of computer science. Most modules will last for one term and will be between 16 to 24 lectures. In addition, all modules will have associated classes and some may also have practical sessions (labs) associated with them. In the third term (Trinity term) you will undertake a dissertation. Subject to meeting the relevant requirements (which may depend upon your module choices, dissertation subject and other academic factors), you may have the opportunity to transfer to a specialist stream of the course prior to completing your dissertation: either the MSc Advanced Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence) or the MSc Advanced Computer Science (Foundations of Computer Science).A typical week for a student taking three courses in each of the first two terms may be as follows:Lectures - eight hoursTutorial classes - three hoursPracticals - four hoursSelf-directed study, including preparatory reading, problem sheets, revision of material - 20 hoursTotal - 35 hoursThe split of work may differ depending on whether a course has practicals associated with it. This should be taken as a guide only. Examples of modules offered:Advanced SecurityComputational BiologyComputational Learning TheoryFoundations of Self-Programming AgentsGeometric Deep LearningGraph Representation LearningProbabilistic Model CheckingDeep Learning in HealthcareQuantum Software The options that are offered may vary from year to year as the course develops, and according to the interests of teaching staff. The above examples illustrate the kinds of topics that have been offered recently.Attendance\n\nThe course is full-time and requires attendance in Oxford. Full-time students are subject to the University's Residence requirements.\n\nResources to support your study\n\nAs a graduate student, you will have access to the University's wide range of world-class resources including libraries, museums, galleries, digital resources and IT services.The Bodleian Libraries is the largest library system in the UK. It includes the main Bodleian Library and libraries across Oxford, including major research libraries and faculty, department and institute libraries. Together, the Libraries hold more than 13 million printed items, provide access to e-journals, and contain outstanding special collections including rare books and manuscripts, classical papyri, maps, music, art and printed ephemera.The University's IT Services is available to all students to support with core university IT systems and tools, as well as many other services and facilities. IT Services also offers a range of IT learning courses for students, to support with learning and research.\n\nThe Department of Computer Science's teaching network comprises over 80 PCs located in the Department of Computer Science and the Practicals Laboratory of the Thom Building, the main building of the Department of Engineering Science. The machines in the Thom Building are mostly used for undergraduate practical sessions, though you may occasionally have a practical session scheduled here.Additionally there is a server-based remote access service available, such as personal laptop at home or through networked computers in college computer rooms.Linux is used throughout the teaching network.The Department of Computer Science Library contains books, monographic series, journals, technical reports and past theses covering the main research interests of the department. It is principally for use by graduate students and staff. You will also be able to access other relevant libraries elsewhere in the University such as the Radcliffe Science Library, the Whitehead Library (at the Mathematical Institute for numerical analysts and formal mathematicians), and the Engineering Science Library (especially for those interested in robotics and machine vision).The Department of Computer Science houses lecture theatres and seminar rooms in which most of the University lectures in Computer Science take place.There are department kitchens on each floor and a central common room where you can meet informally. There is an active social committee organising events for staff, students and families.SupervisionThe allocation of thesis supervision for the course is the responsibility of the Department of Computer Science and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under some circumstances it may be appropriate for a student's thesis work to be supervised by a faculty member outside the department of Computer Science.You will be assigned an initial supervisor on arrival in Oxford whose role is to act as an academic advisor during the first two terms of the course. In the third term, a thesis supervisor will be agreed on.AssessmentFor the taught modules, the mode of assessment shall be either written assignment or written examination, dependent on the module you are taking.A dissertation, completed independently under the guidance of an expert supervisor, on a topic of your choice and approved by the supervisor and MSc Course Director will be submitted by the end of the third term (Trinity Term).Graduate destinationsMany past students have progressed to PhD-level studies at leading universities; other have pursued careers in industry. \n\nChanges to this course and your supervisionThe University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page. However, there may be situations in which it is desirable or necessary for the University to make changes in course provision, either before or after registration. The safety of students, staff and visitors is paramount and major changes to delivery or services may have to be made if a pandemic, epidemic or local health emergency occurs. In addition, in certain circumstances, for example due to visa difficulties or because the health needs of students cannot be met, it may be necessary to make adjustments to course requirements for international study.Where possible your academic supervisor will not change for the duration of your course. However, it may be necessary to assign a new academic supervisor during the course of study or before registration for reasons which might include illness, sabbatical leave, parental leave or change in employment.For further information please see our page on changes to courses and the provisions of the student contract regarding changes to courses.\n\n\nEntry requirements for entry in 2025-26\n\nProven and potential academic excellenceThe requirements described below are specific to this course and apply only in the year of entry that is shown.

For details, please see our guidance on changes to fees and charges.\n\n\n\nWhere can I find further information about fees?The Fees and Funding section of this website provides further information about course fees, including information about fee status and eligibility and your length of fee liability.\n\n\n\nAdditional information\n\n\n\n\nThere are no compulsory elements of this course that entail additional costs beyond fees and living costs. However, as part of your course requirements, you may need to choose a dissertation, a project or a thesis topic. Please note that, depending on your choice of topic and the research required to complete it, you may incur additional expenses, such as travel expenses, research expenses, and field trips. You will need to meet these additional costs, although you may be able to apply for small grants from your department and/or college to help you cover some of these expenses.\n\n\n\nLiving costsIn addition to your course fees and any additional course-specific costs, you will need to ensure that you have adequate funds to support your living costs for the duration of your course.\n\n\n\nLiving costs for full-time studyFor the 2025-26 academic year, the range of likely living costs for a single, full-time student is between £1,425 and £2,035 for each month spent in Oxford. We provide the cost per month so you can multiply up by the number of months you expect to live in Oxford. Depending on your circumstances, you may also need to budget for the costs of a student visa and immigration health surcharge and/or living costs for family members or other dependants that you plan to bring with you to Oxford (assuming that dependant visa eligibility criteria are met).\n\n\n\nFurther information about living costsThe current economic climate and high national rate of inflation make it very hard to estimate potential changes to the cost of living over the next few years. For study in Oxford beyond the 2025-26 academic year, it is suggested that you budget for potential increases in living expenses of around 4% each year – although this rate may vary depending on the national economic situation. For further information, please consult our more detailed information about living costs, which includes a breakdown of likely living costs in Oxford for items such as food, accommodation and study costs.\n\n\nCollege preference\n\nStudents enrolled on this course will belong to both a department/faculty and a college.

It teaches the advanced techniques and ideas that are being developed in application domains (such as machine learning, verification and computer security) and the rich and diverse theories that underpin them. These include models of computation and data, and mathematical analysis of programs and algorithms.The course aims:to provide a challenging and supportive learning environment that encourages high quality students to reach their full potential, personally and academically;to provide the foundation for a professional career in computing-based industries;to enhance the skills of a professional who is already working in one of these industries;to provide a foundation for research into the theory and computing;to present knowledge, experience, reasoning methods and design and implementation techniques which are robust and forward-looking.The Department of Computer Science is committed to the development and application of effective theory based on realistic practice. The MSc in Advanced Computer Science is heavily informed by the department’s consultation and collaboration with industry, and some of the modules were developed through consultation and collaboration with industry. The department believes that only by the interplay of theory and practice can you be trained properly in such a rapidly advancing subject. Practice alerts us to real contemporary problems - theory is a shield against professional obsolescence.Entrants to the course will come from either a computer science or mathematical background. You may be a recent graduate in computer science and will supplement your knowledge with the kind of sound mathematical basis which is not always found in undergraduate courses. If you are a graduate in mathematics you will apply your training in the context of a rigorous application of the fundamental techniques of computer science.You will develop knowledge and understanding of a formal disciplined approach to computer science, a range of relevant concepts, tools and techniques, the principles underpinning these techniques and the ability to apply them in novel situations. On subsequent employment, you will be able to select techniques most appropriate to your working environment, adapt and improve them as necessary, establish appropriate design standards for both hardware and software, train colleagues in the observance of sound practices, and keep abreast of research and development.Course outlineThe academic year is split into three terms of eight weeks but work on the MSc course continues throughout the year and is not restricted just to term time. During the three terms of the course, you will choose from modules on various aspects of computer science. Most modules will last for one term and will be between 16 to 24 lectures. In addition, all modules will have associated classes and some may also have practical sessions (labs) associated with them. In the third term (Trinity term) you will undertake a dissertation. Subject to meeting the relevant requirements (which may depend upon your module choices, dissertation subject and other academic factors), you may have the opportunity to transfer to a specialist stream of the course prior to completing your dissertation: either the MSc Advanced Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence) or the MSc Advanced Computer Science (Foundations of Computer Science).A typical week for a student taking three courses in each of the first two terms may be as follows:Lectures - eight hoursTutorial classes - three hoursPracticals - four hoursSelf-directed study, including preparatory reading, problem sheets, revision of material - 20 hoursTotal - 35 hoursThe split of work may differ depending on whether a course has practicals associated with it. This should be taken as a guide only. Examples of modules offered:Advanced SecurityComputational BiologyComputational Learning TheoryFoundations of Self-Programming AgentsGeometric Deep LearningGraph Representation LearningProbabilistic Model CheckingDeep Learning in HealthcareQuantum Software The options that are offered may vary from year to year as the course develops, and according to the interests of teaching staff. The above examples illustrate the kinds of topics that have been offered recently.Attendance\n\nThe course is full-time and requires attendance in Oxford. Full-time students are subject to the University's Residence requirements.\n\nResources to support your study\n\nAs a graduate student, you will have access to the University's wide range of world-class resources including libraries, museums, galleries, digital resources and IT services.The Bodleian Libraries is the largest library system in the UK. It includes the main Bodleian Library and libraries across Oxford, including major research libraries and faculty, department and institute libraries. Together, the Libraries hold more than 13 million printed items, provide access to e-journals, and contain outstanding special collections including rare books and manuscripts, classical papyri, maps, music, art and printed ephemera.The University's IT Services is available to all students to support with core university IT systems and tools, as well as many other services and facilities. IT Services also offers a range of IT learning courses for students, to support with learning and research.\n\nThe Department of Computer Science's teaching network comprises over 80 PCs located in the Department of Computer Science and the Practicals Laboratory of the Thom Building, the main building of the Department of Engineering Science.

It is principally for use by graduate students and staff. You will also be able to access other relevant libraries elsewhere in the University such as the Radcliffe Science Library, the Whitehead Library (at the Mathematical Institute for numerical analysts and formal mathematicians), and the Engineering Science Library (especially for those interested in robotics and machine vision).The Department of Computer Science houses lecture theatres and seminar rooms in which most of the University lectures in Computer Science take place.There are department kitchens on each floor and a central common room where you can meet informally. There is an active social committee organising events for staff, students and families.SupervisionThe allocation of thesis supervision for the course is the responsibility of the Department of Computer Science and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under some circumstances it may be appropriate for a student's thesis work to be supervised by a faculty member outside the department of Computer Science.You will be assigned an initial supervisor on arrival in Oxford whose role is to act as an academic advisor during the first two terms of the course. In the third term, a thesis supervisor will be agreed on.AssessmentFor the taught modules, the mode of assessment shall be either written assignment or written examination, dependent on the module you are taking.A dissertation, completed independently under the guidance of an expert supervisor, on a topic of your choice and approved by the supervisor and MSc Course Director will be submitted by the end of the third term (Trinity Term).Graduate destinationsMany past students have progressed to PhD-level studies at leading universities; other have pursued careers in industry. \n\nChanges to this course and your supervisionThe University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

Depending on your circumstances, you may also need to budget for the costs of a student visa and immigration health surcharge and/or living costs for family members or other dependants that you plan to bring with you to Oxford (assuming that dependant visa eligibility criteria are met).\n\n\n\nFurther information about living costsThe current economic climate and high national rate of inflation make it very hard to estimate potential changes to the cost of living over the next few years. For study in Oxford beyond the 2025-26 academic year, it is suggested that you budget for potential increases in living expenses of around 4% each year – although this rate may vary depending on the national economic situation. For further information, please consult our more detailed information about living costs, which includes a breakdown of likely living costs in Oxford for items such as food, accommodation and study costs.\nFundingFor entry in the 2025-26 academic year, the collegiate University expects to offer over 1,000 full or partial graduate scholarships across a wide range of graduate courses.If you apply by the January deadline shown on this page and receive a course offer, your application will then be considered for Oxford scholarships. For the majority of Oxford scholarships, your application will automatically be assessed against the eligibility criteria, without needing to make a separate application. There are further Oxford scholarships available which have additional eligibility criteria and where you are required to submit a separate application. Most scholarships are awarded on the basis of academic merit and/or potential.To ensure that you are considered for Oxford scholarships that require a separate application, for which you may be eligible, use our fees, funding and scholarship search tool to identify these opportunities and find out how to apply. Alongside Oxford scholarships, you should also consider other opportunities for which you may be eligible including a range of external funding, loan schemes for postgraduate study and any other scholarships which may also still be available after the January deadline as listed on our fees, funding and scholarship search tool.\nDetails of college-specific funding opportunities can also be found on individual college websites:Select from the list:- Select a college -Balliol CollegeBlackfriarsBrasenose CollegeCampion HallChrist ChurchCorpus Christi CollegeExeter CollegeGreen Templeton CollegeHarris Manchester CollegeHertford CollegeJesus CollegeKeble CollegeKellogg CollegeLady Margaret HallLinacre CollegeLincoln CollegeMagdalen CollegeMansfield CollegeMerton CollegeNew CollegeNuffield CollegeOriel CollegePembroke CollegeThe Queen's CollegeRegent's Park CollegeReuben CollegeSomerville CollegeSt Anne's CollegeSt Antony's CollegeSt Catherine's CollegeSt Cross CollegeSt Edmund HallSt Hilda's CollegeSt Hugh's CollegeSt John's CollegeSt Peter's CollegeTrinity CollegeUniversity CollegeWadham CollegeWolfson CollegeWorcester CollegeWycliffe HallPlease refer to the College preference section of this page to identify which of the colleges listed above accept students for this course.For the majority of college scholarships, it doesn’t matter which college, if any, you state a preference for in your application.

Cairns / Oxford University Images)\n14 May 2025\nAboutEntry requirementsDepartmentFunding and CostsCollege preferenceHow to Apply\n\nAbout the courseThe MSc in Advanced Computer Science at Oxford has been designed to teach a range of advanced topics to graduates of computer science and other mathematical disciplines.\n\n\n\nAs in other branches of applied mathematics and engineering, improvements in the practice of computing necessitate a deep and broad engagement with the foundations of computer science.Recognising this, this full-time, twelve-month MSc has been designed to teach the mathematical principles of specification, design and efficient implementation of computing technologies.The MSc is designed to combine theory and practice. It teaches the advanced techniques and ideas that are being developed in application domains (such as machine learning, verification and computer security) and the rich and diverse theories that underpin them. These include models of computation and data, and mathematical analysis of programs and algorithms.The course aims:to provide a challenging and supportive learning environment that encourages high quality students to reach their full potential, personally and academically;to provide the foundation for a professional career in computing-based industries;to enhance the skills of a professional who is already working in one of these industries;to provide a foundation for research into the theory and computing;to present knowledge, experience, reasoning methods and design and implementation techniques which are robust and forward-looking.The Department of Computer Science is committed to the development and application of effective theory based on realistic practice. The MSc in Advanced Computer Science is heavily informed by the department’s consultation and collaboration with industry, and some of the modules were developed through consultation and collaboration with industry. The department believes that only by the interplay of theory and practice can you be trained properly in such a rapidly advancing subject. Practice alerts us to real contemporary problems - theory is a shield against professional obsolescence.Entrants to the course will come from either a computer science or mathematical background. You may be a recent graduate in computer science and will supplement your knowledge with the kind of sound mathematical basis which is not always found in undergraduate courses. If you are a graduate in mathematics you will apply your training in the context of a rigorous application of the fundamental techniques of computer science.You will develop knowledge and understanding of a formal disciplined approach to computer science, a range of relevant concepts, tools and techniques, the principles underpinning these techniques and the ability to apply them in novel situations. On subsequent employment, you will be able to select techniques most appropriate to your working environment, adapt and improve them as necessary, establish appropriate design standards for both hardware and software, train colleagues in the observance of sound practices, and keep abreast of research and development.Course outlineThe academic year is split into three terms of eight weeks but work on the MSc course continues throughout the year and is not restricted just to term time. During the three terms of the course, you will choose from modules on various aspects of computer science. Most modules will last for one term and will be between 16 to 24 lectures. In addition, all modules will have associated classes and some may also have practical sessions (labs) associated with them. In the third term (Trinity term) you will undertake a dissertation. Subject to meeting the relevant requirements (which may depend upon your module choices, dissertation subject and other academic factors), you may have the opportunity to transfer to a specialist stream of the course prior to completing your dissertation: either the MSc Advanced Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence) or the MSc Advanced Computer Science (Foundations of Computer Science).A typical week for a student taking three courses in each of the first two terms may be as follows:Lectures - eight hoursTutorial classes - three hoursPracticals - four hoursSelf-directed study, including preparatory reading, problem sheets, revision of material - 20 hoursTotal - 35 hoursThe split of work may differ depending on whether a course has practicals associated with it. This should be taken as a guide only. Examples of modules offered:Advanced SecurityComputational BiologyComputational Learning TheoryFoundations of Self-Programming AgentsGeometric Deep LearningGraph Representation LearningProbabilistic Model CheckingDeep Learning in HealthcareQuantum Software The options that are offered may vary from year to year as the course develops, and according to the interests of teaching staff. The above examples illustrate the kinds of topics that have been offered recently.Attendance\n\nThe course is full-time and requires attendance in Oxford. Full-time students are subject to the University's Residence requirements.\n\nResources to support your study\n\nAs a graduate student, you will have access to the University's wide range of world-class resources including libraries, museums, galleries, digital resources and IT services.The Bodleian Libraries is the largest library system in the UK. It includes the main Bodleian Library and libraries across Oxford, including major research libraries and faculty, department and institute libraries. Together, the Libraries hold more than 13 million printed items, provide access to e-journals, and contain outstanding special collections including rare books and manuscripts, classical papyri, maps, music, art and printed ephemera.The University's IT Services is available to all students to support with core university IT systems and tools, as well as many other services and facilities. IT Services also offers a range of IT learning courses for students, to support with learning and research.\n\nThe Department of Computer Science's teaching network comprises over 80 PCs located in the Department of Computer Science and the Practicals Laboratory of the Thom Building, the main building of the Department of Engineering Science. The machines in the Thom Building are mostly used for undergraduate practical sessions, though you may occasionally have a practical session scheduled here.Additionally there is a server-based remote access service available, such as personal laptop at home or through networked computers in college computer rooms.Linux is used throughout the teaching network.The Department of Computer Science Library contains books, monographic series, journals, technical reports and past theses covering the main research interests of the department. It is principally for use by graduate students and staff. You will also be able to access other relevant libraries elsewhere in the University such as the Radcliffe Science Library, the Whitehead Library (at the Mathematical Institute for numerical analysts and formal mathematicians), and the Engineering Science Library (especially for those interested in robotics and machine vision).The Department of Computer Science houses lecture theatres and seminar rooms in which most of the University lectures in Computer Science take place.There are department kitchens on each floor and a central common room where you can meet informally. There is an active social committee organising events for staff, students and families.SupervisionThe allocation of thesis supervision for the course is the responsibility of the Department of Computer Science and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under some circumstances it may be appropriate for a student's thesis work to be supervised by a faculty member outside the department of Computer Science.You will be assigned an initial supervisor on arrival in Oxford whose role is to act as an academic advisor during the first two terms of the course. In the third term, a thesis supervisor will be agreed on.AssessmentFor the taught modules, the mode of assessment shall be either written assignment or written examination, dependent on the module you are taking.A dissertation, completed independently under the guidance of an expert supervisor, on a topic of your choice and approved by the supervisor and MSc Course Director will be submitted by the end of the third term (Trinity Term).Graduate destinationsMany past students have progressed to PhD-level studies at leading universities; other have pursued careers in industry. \n\nChanges to this course and your supervisionThe University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page. However, there may be situations in which it is desirable or necessary for the University to make changes in course provision, either before or after registration. The safety of students, staff and visitors is paramount and major changes to delivery or services may have to be made if a pandemic, epidemic or local health emergency occurs. In addition, in certain circumstances, for example due to visa difficulties or because the health needs of students cannot be met, it may be necessary to make adjustments to course requirements for international study.Where possible your academic supervisor will not change for the duration of your course. However, it may be necessary to assign a new academic supervisor during the course of study or before registration for reasons which might include illness, sabbatical leave, parental leave or change in employment.For further information please see our page on changes to courses and the provisions of the student contract regarding changes to courses.\n\n\nEntry requirements for entry in 2025-26\n\nProven and potential academic excellenceThe requirements described below are specific to this course and apply only in the year of entry that is shown.

It teaches the advanced techniques and ideas that are being developed in application domains (such as machine learning, verification and computer security) and the rich and diverse theories that underpin them. These include models of computation and data, and mathematical analysis of programs and algorithms.The course aims:to provide a challenging and supportive learning environment that encourages high quality students to reach their full potential, personally and academically;to provide the foundation for a professional career in computing-based industries;to enhance the skills of a professional who is already working in one of these industries;to provide a foundation for research into the theory and computing;to present knowledge, experience, reasoning methods and design and implementation techniques which are robust and forward-looking.The Department of Computer Science is committed to the development and application of effective theory based on realistic practice. The MSc in Advanced Computer Science is heavily informed by the department’s consultation and collaboration with industry, and some of the modules were developed through consultation and collaboration with industry. The department believes that only by the interplay of theory and practice can you be trained properly in such a rapidly advancing subject. Practice alerts us to real contemporary problems - theory is a shield against professional obsolescence.Entrants to the course will come from either a computer science or mathematical background. You may be a recent graduate in computer science and will supplement your knowledge with the kind of sound mathematical basis which is not always found in undergraduate courses. If you are a graduate in mathematics you will apply your training in the context of a rigorous application of the fundamental techniques of computer science.You will develop knowledge and understanding of a formal disciplined approach to computer science, a range of relevant concepts, tools and techniques, the principles underpinning these techniques and the ability to apply them in novel situations. On subsequent employment, you will be able to select techniques most appropriate to your working environment, adapt and improve them as necessary, establish appropriate design standards for both hardware and software, train colleagues in the observance of sound practices, and keep abreast of research and development.Course outlineThe academic year is split into three terms of eight weeks but work on the MSc course continues throughout the year and is not restricted just to term time. During the three terms of the course, you will choose from modules on various aspects of computer science. Most modules will last for one term and will be between 16 to 24 lectures. In addition, all modules will have associated classes and some may also have practical sessions (labs) associated with them. In the third term (Trinity term) you will undertake a dissertation. Subject to meeting the relevant requirements (which may depend upon your module choices, dissertation subject and other academic factors), you may have the opportunity to transfer to a specialist stream of the course prior to completing your dissertation: either the MSc Advanced Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence) or the MSc Advanced Computer Science (Foundations of Computer Science).A typical week for a student taking three courses in each of the first two terms may be as follows:Lectures - eight hoursTutorial classes - three hoursPracticals - four hoursSelf-directed study, including preparatory reading, problem sheets, revision of material - 20 hoursTotal - 35 hoursThe split of work may differ depending on whether a course has practicals associated with it. This should be taken as a guide only. Examples of modules offered:Advanced SecurityComputational BiologyComputational Learning TheoryFoundations of Self-Programming AgentsGeometric Deep LearningGraph Representation LearningProbabilistic Model CheckingDeep Learning in HealthcareQuantum Software The options that are offered may vary from year to year as the course develops, and according to the interests of teaching staff. The above examples illustrate the kinds of topics that have been offered recently.Attendance\n\nThe course is full-time and requires attendance in Oxford. Full-time students are subject to the University's Residence requirements.\n\nResources to support your study\n\nAs a graduate student, you will have access to the University's wide range of world-class resources including libraries, museums, galleries, digital resources and IT services.The Bodleian Libraries is the largest library system in the UK. It includes the main Bodleian Library and libraries across Oxford, including major research libraries and faculty, department and institute libraries. Together, the Libraries hold more than 13 million printed items, provide access to e-journals, and contain outstanding special collections including rare books and manuscripts, classical papyri, maps, music, art and printed ephemera.The University's IT Services is available to all students to support with core university IT systems and tools, as well as many other services and facilities. IT Services also offers a range of IT learning courses for students, to support with learning and research.\n\nThe Department of Computer Science's teaching network comprises over 80 PCs located in the Department of Computer Science and the Practicals Laboratory of the Thom Building, the main building of the Department of Engineering Science. The machines in the Thom Building are mostly used for undergraduate practical sessions, though you may occasionally have a practical session scheduled here.Additionally there is a server-based remote access service available, such as personal laptop at home or through networked computers in college computer rooms.Linux is used throughout the teaching network.The Department of Computer Science Library contains books, monographic series, journals, technical reports and past theses covering the main research interests of the department. It is principally for use by graduate students and staff. You will also be able to access other relevant libraries elsewhere in the University such as the Radcliffe Science Library, the Whitehead Library (at the Mathematical Institute for numerical analysts and formal mathematicians), and the Engineering Science Library (especially for those interested in robotics and machine vision).The Department of Computer Science houses lecture theatres and seminar rooms in which most of the University lectures in Computer Science take place.There are department kitchens on each floor and a central common room where you can meet informally. There is an active social committee organising events for staff, students and families.SupervisionThe allocation of thesis supervision for the course is the responsibility of the Department of Computer Science and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under some circumstances it may be appropriate for a student's thesis work to be supervised by a faculty member outside the department of Computer Science.You will be assigned an initial supervisor on arrival in Oxford whose role is to act as an academic advisor during the first two terms of the course. In the third term, a thesis supervisor will be agreed on.AssessmentFor the taught modules, the mode of assessment shall be either written assignment or written examination, dependent on the module you are taking.A dissertation, completed independently under the guidance of an expert supervisor, on a topic of your choice and approved by the supervisor and MSc Course Director will be submitted by the end of the third term (Trinity Term).Graduate destinationsMany past students have progressed to PhD-level studies at leading universities; other have pursued careers in industry. \n\nChanges to this course and your supervisionThe University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page. However, there may be situations in which it is desirable or necessary for the University to make changes in course provision, either before or after registration. The safety of students, staff and visitors is paramount and major changes to delivery or services may have to be made if a pandemic, epidemic or local health emergency occurs. In addition, in certain circumstances, for example due to visa difficulties or because the health needs of students cannot be met, it may be necessary to make adjustments to course requirements for international study.Where possible your academic supervisor will not change for the duration of your course. However, it may be necessary to assign a new academic supervisor during the course of study or before registration for reasons which might include illness, sabbatical leave, parental leave or change in employment.For further information please see our page on changes to courses and the provisions of the student contract regarding changes to courses.\n\n\nEntry requirements for entry in 2025-26\n\nProven and potential academic excellenceThe requirements described below are specific to this course and apply only in the year of entry that is shown.

It teaches the advanced techniques and ideas that are being developed in application domains (such as machine learning, verification and computer security) and the rich and diverse theories that underpin them. These include models of computation and data, and mathematical analysis of programs and algorithms.The course aims:to provide a challenging and supportive learning environment that encourages high quality students to reach their full potential, personally and academically;to provide the foundation for a professional career in computing-based industries;to enhance the skills of a professional who is already working in one of these industries;to provide a foundation for research into the theory and computing;to present knowledge, experience, reasoning methods and design and implementation techniques which are robust and forward-looking.The Department of Computer Science is committed to the development and application of effective theory based on realistic practice. The MSc in Advanced Computer Science is heavily informed by the department’s consultation and collaboration with industry, and some of the modules were developed through consultation and collaboration with industry. The department believes that only by the interplay of theory and practice can you be trained properly in such a rapidly advancing subject. Practice alerts us to real contemporary problems - theory is a shield against professional obsolescence.Entrants to the course will come from either a computer science or mathematical background. You may be a recent graduate in computer science and will supplement your knowledge with the kind of sound mathematical basis which is not always found in undergraduate courses. If you are a graduate in mathematics you will apply your training in the context of a rigorous application of the fundamental techniques of computer science.You will develop knowledge and understanding of a formal disciplined approach to computer science, a range of relevant concepts, tools and techniques, the principles underpinning these techniques and the ability to apply them in novel situations. On subsequent employment, you will be able to select techniques most appropriate to your working environment, adapt and improve them as necessary, establish appropriate design standards for both hardware and software, train colleagues in the observance of sound practices, and keep abreast of research and development.Course outlineThe academic year is split into three terms of eight weeks but work on the MSc course continues throughout the year and is not restricted just to term time. During the three terms of the course, you will choose from modules on various aspects of computer science. Most modules will last for one term and will be between 16 to 24 lectures. In addition, all modules will have associated classes and some may also have practical sessions (labs) associated with them. In the third term (Trinity term) you will undertake a dissertation. Subject to meeting the relevant requirements (which may depend upon your module choices, dissertation subject and other academic factors), you may have the opportunity to transfer to a specialist stream of the course prior to completing your dissertation: either the MSc Advanced Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence) or the MSc Advanced Computer Science (Foundations of Computer Science).A typical week for a student taking three courses in each of the first two terms may be as follows:Lectures - eight hoursTutorial classes - three hoursPracticals - four hoursSelf-directed study, including preparatory reading, problem sheets, revision of material - 20 hoursTotal - 35 hoursThe split of work may differ depending on whether a course has practicals associated with it. This should be taken as a guide only. Examples of modules offered:Advanced SecurityComputational BiologyComputational Learning TheoryFoundations of Self-Programming AgentsGeometric Deep LearningGraph Representation LearningProbabilistic Model CheckingDeep Learning in HealthcareQuantum Software The options that are offered may vary from year to year as the course develops, and according to the interests of teaching staff. The above examples illustrate the kinds of topics that have been offered recently.Attendance\n\nThe course is full-time and requires attendance in Oxford. Full-time students are subject to the University's Residence requirements.\n\nResources to support your study\n\nAs a graduate student, you will have access to the University's wide range of world-class resources including libraries, museums, galleries, digital resources and IT services.The Bodleian Libraries is the largest library system in the UK. It includes the main Bodleian Library and libraries across Oxford, including major research libraries and faculty, department and institute libraries. Together, the Libraries hold more than 13 million printed items, provide access to e-journals, and contain outstanding special collections including rare books and manuscripts, classical papyri, maps, music, art and printed ephemera.The University's IT Services is available to all students to support with core university IT systems and tools, as well as many other services and facilities. IT Services also offers a range of IT learning courses for students, to support with learning and research.\n\nThe Department of Computer Science's teaching network comprises over 80 PCs located in the Department of Computer Science and the Practicals Laboratory of the Thom Building, the main building of the Department of Engineering Science.

It is principally for use by graduate students and staff. You will also be able to access other relevant libraries elsewhere in the University such as the Radcliffe Science Library, the Whitehead Library (at the Mathematical Institute for numerical analysts and formal mathematicians), and the Engineering Science Library (especially for those interested in robotics and machine vision).The Department of Computer Science houses lecture theatres and seminar rooms in which most of the University lectures in Computer Science take place.There are department kitchens on each floor and a central common room where you can meet informally. There is an active social committee organising events for staff, students and families.SupervisionThe allocation of thesis supervision for the course is the responsibility of the Department of Computer Science and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under some circumstances it may be appropriate for a student's thesis work to be supervised by a faculty member outside the department of Computer Science.You will be assigned an initial supervisor on arrival in Oxford whose role is to act as an academic advisor during the first two terms of the course. In the third term, a thesis supervisor will be agreed on.AssessmentFor the taught modules, the mode of assessment shall be either written assignment or written examination, dependent on the module you are taking.A dissertation, completed independently under the guidance of an expert supervisor, on a topic of your choice and approved by the supervisor and MSc Course Director will be submitted by the end of the third term (Trinity Term).Graduate destinationsMany past students have progressed to PhD-level studies at leading universities; other have pursued careers in industry. \n\nChanges to this course and your supervisionThe University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

Most scholarships are awarded on the basis of academic merit and/or potential.To ensure that you are considered for Oxford scholarships that require a separate application, for which you may be eligible, use our fees, funding and scholarship search tool to identify these opportunities and find out how to apply. Alongside Oxford scholarships, you should also consider other opportunities for which you may be eligible including a range of external funding, loan schemes for postgraduate study and any other scholarships which may also still be available after the January deadline as listed on our fees, funding and scholarship search tool.\nDetails of college-specific funding opportunities can also be found on individual college websites:Select from the list:- Select a college -Balliol CollegeBlackfriarsBrasenose CollegeCampion HallChrist ChurchCorpus Christi CollegeExeter CollegeGreen Templeton CollegeHarris Manchester CollegeHertford CollegeJesus CollegeKeble CollegeKellogg CollegeLady Margaret HallLinacre CollegeLincoln CollegeMagdalen CollegeMansfield CollegeMerton CollegeNew CollegeNuffield CollegeOriel CollegePembroke CollegeThe Queen's CollegeRegent's Park CollegeReuben CollegeSomerville CollegeSt Anne's CollegeSt Antony's CollegeSt Catherine's CollegeSt Cross CollegeSt Edmund HallSt Hilda's CollegeSt Hugh's CollegeSt John's CollegeSt Peter's CollegeTrinity CollegeUniversity CollegeWadham CollegeWolfson CollegeWorcester CollegeWycliffe HallPlease refer to the College preference section of this page to identify which of the colleges listed above accept students for this course.For the majority of college scholarships, it doesn’t matter which college, if any, you state a preference for in your application. If another college is able to offer you a scholarship, your application can be moved to that college if you accept the scholarship. Some college scholarships may require you to state a preference for that college when you apply, so check the eligibility requirements carefully.\nCostsAnnual course feesThe fees for this course are charged on an annual basis.\nFees for the 2025-26 academic year at the University of Oxford\nWhat do course fees cover?Course fees cover your teaching as well as other academic services and facilities provided to support your studies. Unless specified in the additional information section below, course fees do not cover your accommodation, residential costs or other living costs. They also don’t cover any additional costs and charges that are outlined in the additional information section below.How long do I need to pay course fees?Course fees are payable each year, for the duration of your fee liability (your fee liability is the length of time for which you are required to pay course fees). For courses lasting longer than one year, please be aware that fees will usually increase annually. For details, please see our guidance on changes to fees and charges.\nWhere can I find further information about fees?The Fees and Funding section of this website provides further information about course fees, including information about fee status and eligibility and your length of fee liability.\nAdditional information\nLiving costsIn addition to your course fees and any additional course-specific costs, you will need to ensure that you have adequate funds to support your living costs for the duration of your course.\nLiving costs for full-time studyFor the 2025-26 academic year, the range of likely living costs for a single, full-time student is between £1,425 and £2,035 for each month spent in Oxford. We provide the cost per month so you can multiply up by the number of months you expect to live in Oxford. Depending on your circumstances, you may also need to budget for the costs of a student visa and immigration health surcharge and/or living costs for family members or other dependants that you plan to bring with you to Oxford (assuming that dependant visa eligibility criteria are met).\nFurther information about living costsThe current economic climate and high national rate of inflation make it very hard to estimate potential changes to the cost of living over the next few years. For study in Oxford beyond the 2025-26 academic year, it is suggested that you budget for potential increases in living expenses of around 4% each year – although this rate may vary depending on the national economic situation. For further information, please consult our more detailed information about living costs, which includes a breakdown of likely living costs in Oxford for items such as food, accommodation and study costs.\nCollege preference\n\nStudents enrolled on this course will belong to both a department/faculty and a college.

It teaches the advanced techniques and ideas that are being developed in application domains (such as machine learning, verification and computer security) and the rich and diverse theories that underpin them. These include models of computation and data, and mathematical analysis of programs and algorithms.The course aims:to provide a challenging and supportive learning environment that encourages high quality students to reach their full potential, personally and academically;to provide the foundation for a professional career in computing-based industries;to enhance the skills of a professional who is already working in one of these industries;to provide a foundation for research into the theory and computing;to present knowledge, experience, reasoning methods and design and implementation techniques which are robust and forward-looking.The Department of Computer Science is committed to the development and application of effective theory based on realistic practice. The MSc in Advanced Computer Science is heavily informed by the department’s consultation and collaboration with industry, and some of the modules were developed through consultation and collaboration with industry. The department believes that only by the interplay of theory and practice can you be trained properly in such a rapidly advancing subject. Practice alerts us to real contemporary problems - theory is a shield against professional obsolescence.Entrants to the course will come from either a computer science or mathematical background. You may be a recent graduate in computer science and will supplement your knowledge with the kind of sound mathematical basis which is not always found in undergraduate courses. If you are a graduate in mathematics you will apply your training in the context of a rigorous application of the fundamental techniques of computer science.You will develop knowledge and understanding of a formal disciplined approach to computer science, a range of relevant concepts, tools and techniques, the principles underpinning these techniques and the ability to apply them in novel situations. On subsequent employment, you will be able to select techniques most appropriate to your working environment, adapt and improve them as necessary, establish appropriate design standards for both hardware and software, train colleagues in the observance of sound practices, and keep abreast of research and development.Course outlineThe academic year is split into three terms of eight weeks but work on the MSc course continues throughout the year and is not restricted just to term time. During the three terms of the course, you will choose from modules on various aspects of computer science. Most modules will last for one term and will be between 16 to 24 lectures. In addition, all modules will have associated classes and some may also have practical sessions (labs) associated with them. In the third term (Trinity term) you will undertake a dissertation. Subject to meeting the relevant requirements (which may depend upon your module choices, dissertation subject and other academic factors), you may have the opportunity to transfer to a specialist stream of the course prior to completing your dissertation: either the MSc Advanced Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence) or the MSc Advanced Computer Science (Foundations of Computer Science).A typical week for a student taking three courses in each of the first two terms may be as follows:Lectures - eight hoursTutorial classes - three hoursPracticals - four hoursSelf-directed study, including preparatory reading, problem sheets, revision of material - 20 hoursTotal - 35 hoursThe split of work may differ depending on whether a course has practicals associated with it. This should be taken as a guide only. Examples of modules offered:Advanced SecurityComputational BiologyComputational Learning TheoryFoundations of Self-Programming AgentsGeometric Deep LearningGraph Representation LearningProbabilistic Model CheckingDeep Learning in HealthcareQuantum Software The options that are offered may vary from year to year as the course develops, and according to the interests of teaching staff. The above examples illustrate the kinds of topics that have been offered recently.Attendance\n\nThe course is full-time and requires attendance in Oxford. Full-time students are subject to the University's Residence requirements.\n\nResources to support your study\n\nAs a graduate student, you will have access to the University's wide range of world-class resources including libraries, museums, galleries, digital resources and IT services.The Bodleian Libraries is the largest library system in the UK. It includes the main Bodleian Library and libraries across Oxford, including major research libraries and faculty, department and institute libraries. Together, the Libraries hold more than 13 million printed items, provide access to e-journals, and contain outstanding special collections including rare books and manuscripts, classical papyri, maps, music, art and printed ephemera.The University's IT Services is available to all students to support with core university IT systems and tools, as well as many other services and facilities. IT Services also offers a range of IT learning courses for students, to support with learning and research.\n\nThe Department of Computer Science's teaching network comprises over 80 PCs located in the Department of Computer Science and the Practicals Laboratory of the Thom Building, the main building of the Department of Engineering Science. The machines in the Thom Building are mostly used for undergraduate practical sessions, though you may occasionally have a practical session scheduled here.Additionally there is a server-based remote access service available, such as personal laptop at home or through networked computers in college computer rooms.Linux is used throughout the teaching network.The Department of Computer Science Library contains books, monographic series, journals, technical reports and past theses covering the main research interests of the department. It is principally for use by graduate students and staff. You will also be able to access other relevant libraries elsewhere in the University such as the Radcliffe Science Library, the Whitehead Library (at the Mathematical Institute for numerical analysts and formal mathematicians), and the Engineering Science Library (especially for those interested in robotics and machine vision).The Department of Computer Science houses lecture theatres and seminar rooms in which most of the University lectures in Computer Science take place.There are department kitchens on each floor and a central common room where you can meet informally. There is an active social committee organising events for staff, students and families.SupervisionThe allocation of thesis supervision for the course is the responsibility of the Department of Computer Science and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under some circumstances it may be appropriate for a student's thesis work to be supervised by a faculty member outside the department of Computer Science.You will be assigned an initial supervisor on arrival in Oxford whose role is to act as an academic advisor during the first two terms of the course. In the third term, a thesis supervisor will be agreed on.AssessmentFor the taught modules, the mode of assessment shall be either written assignment or written examination, dependent on the module you are taking.A dissertation, completed independently under the guidance of an expert supervisor, on a topic of your choice and approved by the supervisor and MSc Course Director will be submitted by the end of the third term (Trinity Term).Graduate destinationsMany past students have progressed to PhD-level studies at leading universities; other have pursued careers in industry. \n\nChanges to this course and your supervisionThe University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page. However, there may be situations in which it is desirable or necessary for the University to make changes in course provision, either before or after registration. The safety of students, staff and visitors is paramount and major changes to delivery or services may have to be made if a pandemic, epidemic or local health emergency occurs. In addition, in certain circumstances, for example due to visa difficulties or because the health needs of students cannot be met, it may be necessary to make adjustments to course requirements for international study.Where possible your academic supervisor will not change for the duration of your course. However, it may be necessary to assign a new academic supervisor during the course of study or before registration for reasons which might include illness, sabbatical leave, parental leave or change in employment.For further information please see our page on changes to courses and the provisions of the student contract regarding changes to courses.\n\n\nEntry requirements for entry in 2025-26\n\nProven and potential academic excellenceThe requirements described below are specific to this course and apply only in the year of entry that is shown.

Unless specified in the additional information section below, course fees do not cover your accommodation, residential costs or other living costs. They also don’t cover any additional costs and charges that are outlined in the additional information section below.How long do I need to pay course fees?Course fees are payable each year, for the duration of your fee liability (your fee liability is the length of time for which you are required to pay course fees). For courses lasting longer than one year, please be aware that fees will usually increase annually. For details, please see our guidance on changes to fees and charges.\n\n\n\nWhere can I find further information about fees?The Fees and Funding section of this website provides further information about course fees, including information about fee status and eligibility and your length of fee liability.\n\n\n\nAdditional information\n\n\n\n\nThere are no compulsory elements of this course that entail additional costs beyond fees and living costs. However, as part of your course requirements, you may need to choose a dissertation, a project or a thesis topic. Please note that, depending on your choice of topic and the research required to complete it, you may incur additional expenses, such as travel expenses, research expenses, and field trips. You will need to meet these additional costs, although you may be able to apply for small grants from your department and/or college to help you cover some of these expenses.\n\n\n\nLiving costsIn addition to your course fees and any additional course-specific costs, you will need to ensure that you have adequate funds to support your living costs for the duration of your course.\n\n\n\nLiving costs for full-time studyFor the 2025-26 academic year, the range of likely living costs for a single, full-time student is between £1,425 and £2,035 for each month spent in Oxford. We provide the cost per month so you can multiply up by the number of months you expect to live in Oxford. Depending on your circumstances, you may also need to budget for the costs of a student visa and immigration health surcharge and/or living costs for family members or other dependants that you plan to bring with you to Oxford (assuming that dependant visa eligibility criteria are met).\n\n\n\nFurther information about living costsThe current economic climate and high national rate of inflation make it very hard to estimate potential changes to the cost of living over the next few years. For study in Oxford beyond the 2025-26 academic year, it is suggested that you budget for potential increases in living expenses of around 4% each year – although this rate may vary depending on the national economic situation. For further information, please consult our more detailed information about living costs, which includes a breakdown of likely living costs in Oxford for items such as food, accommodation and study costs.\n\n\nCollege preference\n\nStudents enrolled on this course will belong to both a department/faculty and a college.

It teaches the advanced techniques and ideas that are being developed in application domains (such as machine learning, verification and computer security) and the rich and diverse theories that underpin them. These include models of computation and data, and mathematical analysis of programs and algorithms.The course aims:to provide a challenging and supportive learning environment that encourages high quality students to reach their full potential, personally and academically;to provide the foundation for a professional career in computing-based industries;to enhance the skills of a professional who is already working in one of these industries;to provide a foundation for research into the theory and computing;to present knowledge, experience, reasoning methods and design and implementation techniques which are robust and forward-looking.The Department of Computer Science is committed to the development and application of effective theory based on realistic practice. The MSc in Advanced Computer Science is heavily informed by the department’s consultation and collaboration with industry, and some of the modules were developed through consultation and collaboration with industry. The department believes that only by the interplay of theory and practice can you be trained properly in such a rapidly advancing subject. Practice alerts us to real contemporary problems - theory is a shield against professional obsolescence.Entrants to the course will come from either a computer science or mathematical background. You may be a recent graduate in computer science and will supplement your knowledge with the kind of sound mathematical basis which is not always found in undergraduate courses. If you are a graduate in mathematics you will apply your training in the context of a rigorous application of the fundamental techniques of computer science.You will develop knowledge and understanding of a formal disciplined approach to computer science, a range of relevant concepts, tools and techniques, the principles underpinning these techniques and the ability to apply them in novel situations. On subsequent employment, you will be able to select techniques most appropriate to your working environment, adapt and improve them as necessary, establish appropriate design standards for both hardware and software, train colleagues in the observance of sound practices, and keep abreast of research and development.Course outlineThe academic year is split into three terms of eight weeks but work on the MSc course continues throughout the year and is not restricted just to term time. During the three terms of the course, you will choose from modules on various aspects of computer science. Most modules will last for one term and will be between 16 to 24 lectures. In addition, all modules will have associated classes and some may also have practical sessions (labs) associated with them. In the third term (Trinity term) you will undertake a dissertation. Subject to meeting the relevant requirements (which may depend upon your module choices, dissertation subject and other academic factors), you may have the opportunity to transfer to a specialist stream of the course prior to completing your dissertation: either the MSc Advanced Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence) or the MSc Advanced Computer Science (Foundations of Computer Science).A typical week for a student taking three courses in each of the first two terms may be as follows:Lectures - eight hoursTutorial classes - three hoursPracticals - four hoursSelf-directed study, including preparatory reading, problem sheets, revision of material - 20 hoursTotal - 35 hoursThe split of work may differ depending on whether a course has practicals associated with it. This should be taken as a guide only. Examples of modules offered:Advanced SecurityComputational BiologyComputational Learning TheoryFoundations of Self-Programming AgentsGeometric Deep LearningGraph Representation LearningProbabilistic Model CheckingDeep Learning in HealthcareQuantum Software The options that are offered may vary from year to year as the course develops, and according to the interests of teaching staff. The above examples illustrate the kinds of topics that have been offered recently.Attendance\n\nThe course is full-time and requires attendance in Oxford. Full-time students are subject to the University's Residence requirements.\n\nResources to support your study\n\nAs a graduate student, you will have access to the University's wide range of world-class resources including libraries, museums, galleries, digital resources and IT services.The Bodleian Libraries is the largest library system in the UK. It includes the main Bodleian Library and libraries across Oxford, including major research libraries and faculty, department and institute libraries. Together, the Libraries hold more than 13 million printed items, provide access to e-journals, and contain outstanding special collections including rare books and manuscripts, classical papyri, maps, music, art and printed ephemera.The University's IT Services is available to all students to support with core university IT systems and tools, as well as many other services and facilities. IT Services also offers a range of IT learning courses for students, to support with learning and research.\n\nThe Department of Computer Science's teaching network comprises over 80 PCs located in the Department of Computer Science and the Practicals Laboratory of the Thom Building, the main building of the Department of Engineering Science.

It is principally for use by graduate students and staff. You will also be able to access other relevant libraries elsewhere in the University such as the Radcliffe Science Library, the Whitehead Library (at the Mathematical Institute for numerical analysts and formal mathematicians), and the Engineering Science Library (especially for those interested in robotics and machine vision).The Department of Computer Science houses lecture theatres and seminar rooms in which most of the University lectures in Computer Science take place.There are department kitchens on each floor and a central common room where you can meet informally. There is an active social committee organising events for staff, students and families.SupervisionThe allocation of thesis supervision for the course is the responsibility of the Department of Computer Science and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under some circumstances it may be appropriate for a student's thesis work to be supervised by a faculty member outside the department of Computer Science.You will be assigned an initial supervisor on arrival in Oxford whose role is to act as an academic advisor during the first two terms of the course. In the third term, a thesis supervisor will be agreed on.AssessmentFor the taught modules, the mode of assessment shall be either written assignment or written examination, dependent on the module you are taking.A dissertation, completed independently under the guidance of an expert supervisor, on a topic of your choice and approved by the supervisor and MSc Course Director will be submitted by the end of the third term (Trinity Term).Graduate destinationsMany past students have progressed to PhD-level studies at leading universities; other have pursued careers in industry. \n\nChanges to this course and your supervisionThe University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

Unless specified in the additional information section below, course fees do not cover your accommodation, residential costs or other living costs. They also don’t cover any additional costs and charges that are outlined in the additional information section below.How long do I need to pay course fees?Course fees are payable each year, for the duration of your fee liability (your fee liability is the length of time for which you are required to pay course fees). For courses lasting longer than one year, please be aware that fees will usually increase annually. For details, please see our guidance on changes to fees and charges.\n\n\n\nWhere can I find further information about fees?The Fees and Funding section of this website provides further information about course fees, including information about fee status and eligibility and your length of fee liability.\n\n\n\nAdditional information\n\n\n\n\nThere are no compulsory elements of this course that entail additional costs beyond fees and living costs. However, as part of your course requirements, you may need to choose a dissertation, a project or a thesis topic. Please note that, depending on your choice of topic and the research required to complete it, you may incur additional expenses, such as travel expenses, research expenses, and field trips. You will need to meet these additional costs, although you may be able to apply for small grants from your department and/or college to help you cover some of these expenses.\n\n\n\nLiving costsIn addition to your course fees and any additional course-specific costs, you will need to ensure that you have adequate funds to support your living costs for the duration of your course.\n\n\n\nLiving costs for full-time studyFor the 2025-26 academic year, the range of likely living costs for a single, full-time student is between £1,425 and £2,035 for each month spent in Oxford. We provide the cost per month so you can multiply up by the number of months you expect to live in Oxford. Depending on your circumstances, you may also need to budget for the costs of a student visa and immigration health surcharge and/or living costs for family members or other dependants that you plan to bring with you to Oxford (assuming that dependant visa eligibility criteria are met).\n\n\n\nFurther information about living costsThe current economic climate and high national rate of inflation make it very hard to estimate potential changes to the cost of living over the next few years. For study in Oxford beyond the 2025-26 academic year, it is suggested that you budget for potential increases in living expenses of around 4% each year – although this rate may vary depending on the national economic situation. For further information, please consult our more detailed information about living costs, which includes a breakdown of likely living costs in Oxford for items such as food, accommodation and study costs.\nFundingFor entry in the 2025-26 academic year, the collegiate University expects to offer over 1,000 full or partial graduate scholarships across a wide range of graduate courses.If you apply by the January deadline shown on this page and receive a course offer, your application will then be considered for Oxford scholarships. For the majority of Oxford scholarships, your application will automatically be assessed against the eligibility criteria, without needing to make a separate application.

For example, for the 2023-24 academic year, just over 45% of our new graduate students received full or partial funding from the University or other funders.\nThis page provides more information on the range of funding the University offers through scholarships, Research Councils and studentships.\nWhen undertaking your funding search you should consider the following:\nFor the 2025-26 academic year, the University expects to be able to offer over 1,000 full or partial graduate scholarships for new students.\nScholarships are usually awarded on the basis of academic excellence and potential, and will cover some or all of your course fees and/or provide a grant for living costs for your period of fee liability. The eligibility criteria for different scholarships vary, with some being open to the majority of new graduate students and others restricted by particular characteristics, for example by degree subject or country of ordinary residence. Some scholarship schemes offer additional benefits like events to support scholars, or membership of a scholar community or leadership programme.\nSpecific information about scholarships and funding for applicants from under-represented groups is available in our Graduate access section.\nFor the majority of Oxford scholarships, all you need to do is submit your graduate application by the December or January deadline for your course. There’s no separate scholarship application process or extra supporting documentation required for funding. Based on the information supplied in your graduate application, you will be automatically considered for scholarships where you meet the eligibility criteria with most scholarships using academic merit and/or potential as the basis on which award decisions are made. For more information please see the Standard scholarship selection terms.\nTo help identify those scholarships that require an additional application, use the Fees, funding and scholarships search and look at individual college websites.\nThe vast majority of college scholarships do not require you to select that particular college as your preference on the graduate application form. They will consider all eligible applicants who apply by the relevant deadline. If you are selected for a college scholarship, we will move your place to the relevant college.\nMost Oxford scholarships are awarded between late February and June. The approximate date by which decisions are expected to be made will normally be given in the scholarship information available from the A-Z of Scholarships.\nA scholarship may be awarded either at the same time or after you are offered a place by your department. It may be awarded either before or after you have been offered a college place.\nThe seven UK Research Councils are publicly funded bodies that support research and studentships across a range of subject areas. High numbers of awards are received by our postgraduate students in recognition of the quality of the world-class research carried out at Oxford. Some colleges also provide partnership awards linked to Research Council awards, details of which are available under College Partnership Awards.\nUKRI award postgraduate studentships to both home and international students, including fees (up to that research council’s UK rate) and living stipend. UKRI will normally limit the proportion of international students appointed each year through individual doctoral training programmes to 30% of the total. Further information can be found on the UKRI website.\nFor full details about eligibility requirements and how to apply, please see links to the relevant council below.\nThe AHRC provides public funding in support of research into the arts and humanities, for approximately one quarter of the UK's research population. Oxford participates in the Open-Oxford-Cambridge AHRC Doctoral Training Partnership, providing a number of scholarships each year across humanities subject areas between 2019 and 2024. The January 2025 application deadline (for entry in 2025-26) will be the final year of the OOC AHRC DTP. Information about applying for AHRC scholarships at Oxford can currently be found on the OOC DTP website.\nThe BBSRC supports the UK's world-leading position in bioscience. It aims to promote and support high quality basic, strategic and applied research and postgraduate training relating to the understanding and exploitation of biological systems. BBSRC studentship funding, including Industrial CASE studentship funding, will be awarded primarily through the Oxford Interdisciplinary Life and Environmental Landscape Award (pending approval). Questions about BBSRC funding should currently be directed to the Oxford Interdisciplinary Bioscience DTP.\nThe EPSRC is the main UK government agency for funding research and training in engineering and the physical sciences. Applicants for doctoral research with the EPSRC remit will automatically be considered for EPSRC Doctoral Landscape Award funding (pending approval). In addition to these open eligibility awards, EPSRC funds a number of Centres for Doctoral Training at Oxford, which can also be found on the A-Z of courses page (use the search term 'iCASE' - these studentships are typically advertised slightly later, check in November to January for opportunities). Questions about EPSRC funding should also be referred to the relevant department or CDT.\nThe ESRC is the UK’s largest organisation for funding research on social and economic issues. The University, in collaboration with Brunel University and the Open University, hosts the Grand Union Doctoral Training Partnership.\nESRC funding covers both full and part-time study and the DTP offers a variety of award structures and lengths, depending on prior training and course arrangements. A Masters qualification is not a prerequisite for studying with the Grand Union DTP, all pathways have options for students without a Masters who are intending to carry out doctoral research.\nIn order to be considered for a Grand Union DTP ESRC studentship, you must select 'ESRC Grand Union DTP' in the University of Oxford Scholarships section of the University's graduate application form. You must complete a Grand Union DTP Application Form (which can be found on the DTP website) and upload it, together with your graduate application form, by the relevant funding deadline for your course.\nFull details can be found on the Grand Union DTP website. Please ensure you have read all of the guidance available on the website before completing the Grant Union DTP Studentship Application Form. Questions can be directed to the Grand Union DTP Office.\nThe MRC promotes research into all areas of medical and related science with the aims of improving the health and quality of life of the UK public and contributing to the wealth of the nation. The University of Oxford receives a Doctoral Training Partnership Grant from the MRC from which studentships are created and awarded.\nIn order to be considered for  funding applications must be received by the December deadline (Tuesday 3 December 2024). Certain MRC-funded units and centres receive a direct allocation of MRC Studentships; usually, all eligible applicants that apply by the December deadline are automatically considered for these awards. In some cases, however, they are advertised separately by individual departments. More information can be found on the Oxford MRC DTP page.\nNERC is the UK's main agency for funding and managing research, training and knowledge exchange in the environmental sciences. Their work covers the full range of atmospheric, earth, biological, terrestrial and aquatic science. NERC funding at Oxford will be awarded primarily through the Interdisciplinary Life and Environmental Sciences Landscape Award (pending approval). Questions about NERC funding should currently be directed to the Environmental Research DTP. Oxford is also a member of the NERC-funded EcoWild CDT, which focuses on protecting the Earth’s vulnerable wetlands.\nThe STFC support, promote and coordinate research into spheres ranging from particle and nuclear physics to space, laser and materials science. Opportunities for STFC funding at Oxford are advertised on the relevant department pages, accessible via the Departments A-Z page. Questions about STFC funding should also be referred to the relevant department.\nResearch Councils College Partnership Awards are fully-funded Research Council scholarships which are partially funded by a college. All Research Councils allow graduate studentship funding to be partnered with other sources of funding, thereby allowing universities to increase the number of studentships available. The College Partnership Awards are only tenable at the college providing the funding.\nThere is no separate application process for the College Partnership Awards and all eligible graduate candidates who are awarded a Research Councils studentship will be considered. We may move your application to a college offering a partnership award, even if this is not your preferred college (for applicants who have stated a preference on the graduate application form).\nA studentship provides funding for postgraduate research students who are working on specific projects. The funding is normally provided by an organisation such as a Research Council or through a combination of funds from an academic department, college or external body.\nFunded studentships usually offer either full or fees-only financial support to pursue research for a named project or area of study.\nCheck your academic department’s website for details of any current studentship opportunities and how to apply. There is a section in the online graduate application form where you will be able to enter the code(s), if required, for any studentships for which you wish to be considered. If a code is required it will be provided on the relevant department's website.\nIf you have a query about graduate admissions at Oxford, we're here to help:\nAsk a question\nPostgraduate Applicant Privacy Policy\n• Overview\n• Scholarships\n• Research Councils\n• Studentships\n• Do not delay! Start thinking about the different funding options available to you as soon as you decide to apply to Oxford – do not wait until you have an offer of a place.

The vast majority of Oxford scholarships are open to new graduate students only. Funding options for on-course students are extremely limited. You should therefore be confident that you can fund your whole course, including living costs.\n• Do not assume you can earn your way through your studies. If you are a full-time student, there will not be much time to take on paid work, and if you are a part-time student, you will need to ensure that work does not impact on your studies.

See our Policy on working whilst studying.\nScholarshipsFor the 2025-26 academic year, the University expects to be able to offer over 1,000 full or partial graduate scholarships for new students.Scholarships are usually awarded on the basis of academic excellence and potential, and will cover some or all of your course fees and/or provide a grant for living costs for your period of fee liability. The eligibility criteria for different scholarships vary, with some being open to the majority of new graduate students and others restricted by particular characteristics, for example by degree subject or country of ordinary residence. Some scholarship schemes offer additional benefits like events to support scholars, or membership of a scholar community or leadership programme.Specific information about scholarships and funding for applicants from under-represented groups is available in our Graduate access section.How do I apply?For the majority of Oxford scholarships, all you need to do is submit your graduate application by the December or January deadline for your course. There’s no separate scholarship application process or extra supporting documentation required for funding. Based on the information supplied in your graduate application, you will be automatically considered for scholarships where you meet the eligibility criteria with most scholarships using academic merit and/or potential as the basis on which award decisions are made. For more information please see the Standard scholarship selection terms. To help identify those scholarships that require an additional application, use the Fees, funding and scholarships search and look at individual college websites.The vast majority of college scholarships do not require you to select that particular college as your preference on the graduate application form. They will consider all eligible applicants who apply by the relevant deadline. If you are selected for a college scholarship, we will move your place to the relevant college.When are scholarships awarded?Most Oxford scholarships are awarded between late February and June. The approximate date by which decisions are expected to be made will normally be given in the scholarship information available from the A-Z of Scholarships.A scholarship may be awarded either at the same time or after you are offered a place by your department. It may be awarded either before or after you have been offered a college place.\nResearch CouncilsThe seven UK Research Councils are publicly funded bodies that support research and studentships across a range of subject areas. High numbers of awards are received by our postgraduate students in recognition of the quality of the world-class research carried out at Oxford. Some colleges also provide partnership awards linked to Research Council awards, details of which are available under College Partnership Awards.UKRI award postgraduate studentships to both home and international students, including fees (up to that research council’s UK rate) and living stipend. UKRI will normally limit the proportion of international students appointed each year through individual doctoral training programmes to 30% of the total. Further information can be found on the UKRI website. How do I apply?For full details about eligibility requirements and how to apply, please see links to the relevant council below.Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC)The AHRC provides public funding in support of research into the arts and humanities, for approximately one quarter of the UK's research population. Oxford participates in the Open-Oxford-Cambridge AHRC Doctoral Training Partnership, providing a number of scholarships each year across humanities subject areas between 2019 and 2024. The January 2025 application deadline (for entry in 2025-26) will be the final year of the OOC AHRC DTP. Information about applying for AHRC scholarships at Oxford can currently be found on the OOC DTP website.Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)The BBSRC supports the UK's world-leading position in bioscience. It aims to promote and support high quality basic, strategic and applied research and postgraduate training relating to the understanding and exploitation of biological systems. BBSRC studentship funding, including Industrial CASE studentship funding, will be awarded primarily through the Oxford Interdisciplinary Life and Environmental Landscape Award (pending approval). Questions about BBSRC funding should currently be directed to the Oxford Interdisciplinary Bioscience DTP.Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)The EPSRC is the main UK government agency for funding research and training in engineering and the physical sciences. Applicants for doctoral research with the EPSRC remit will automatically be considered for EPSRC Doctoral Landscape Award funding (pending approval). In addition to these open eligibility awards, EPSRC funds a number of Centres for Doctoral Training at Oxford, which can also be found on the A-Z of courses page (use the search term 'iCASE' - these studentships are typically advertised slightly later, check in November to January for opportunities). Questions about EPSRC funding should also be referred to the relevant department or CDT.Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)The ESRC is the UK’s largest organisation for funding research on social and economic issues. The University, in collaboration with Brunel University and the Open University, hosts the Grand Union Doctoral Training Partnership.ESRC funding covers both full and part-time study and the DTP offers a variety of award structures and lengths, depending on prior training and course arrangements. A Masters qualification is not a prerequisite for studying with the Grand Union DTP, all pathways have options for students without a Masters who are intending to carry out doctoral research.In order to be considered for a Grand Union DTP ESRC studentship, you must select 'ESRC Grand Union DTP' in the University of Oxford Scholarships section of the University's graduate application form. You must complete a Grand Union DTP Application Form (which can be found on the DTP website) and upload it, together with your graduate application form, by the relevant funding deadline for your course.Full details can be found on the Grand Union DTP website. Please ensure you have read all of the guidance available on the website before completing the Grant Union DTP Studentship Application Form. Questions can be directed to the Grand Union DTP Office.Medical Research Council (MRC)The MRC promotes research into all areas of medical and related science with the aims of improving the health and quality of life of the UK public and contributing to the wealth of the nation. The University of Oxford receives a Doctoral Training Partnership Grant from the MRC from which studentships are created and awarded. In order to be considered for  funding applications must be received by the December deadline (Tuesday 3 December 2024). Certain MRC-funded units and centres receive a direct allocation of MRC Studentships; usually, all eligible applicants that apply by the December deadline are automatically considered for these awards. In some cases, however, they are advertised separately by individual departments. More information can be found on the Oxford MRC DTP page.Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)NERC is the UK's main agency for funding and managing research, training and knowledge exchange in the environmental sciences. Their work covers the full range of atmospheric, earth, biological, terrestrial and aquatic science. NERC funding at Oxford will be awarded primarily through the Interdisciplinary Life and Environmental Sciences Landscape Award (pending approval). Questions about NERC funding should currently be directed to the Environmental Research DTP. Oxford is also a member of the NERC-funded EcoWild CDT, which focuses on protecting the Earth’s vulnerable wetlands.Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC)The STFC support, promote and coordinate research into spheres ranging from particle and nuclear physics to space, laser and materials science. Opportunities for STFC funding at Oxford are advertised on the relevant department pages, accessible via the Departments A-Z page. Questions about STFC funding should also be referred to the relevant department.Research Councils College Partnership AwardsResearch Councils College Partnership Awards are fully-funded Research Council scholarships which are partially funded by a college. All Research Councils allow graduate studentship funding to be partnered with other sources of funding, thereby allowing universities to increase the number of studentships available. The College Partnership Awards are only tenable at the college providing the funding.There is no separate application process for the College Partnership Awards and all eligible graduate candidates who are awarded a Research Councils studentship will be considered. We may move your application to a college offering a partnership award, even if this is not your preferred college (for applicants who have stated a preference on the graduate application form).\nStudentshipsA studentship provides funding for postgraduate research students who are working on specific projects. The funding is normally provided by an organisation such as a Research Council or through a combination of funds from an academic department, college or external body.Funded studentships usually offer either full or fees-only financial support to pursue research for a named project or area of study.How do I apply?Check your academic department’s website for details of any current studentship opportunities and how to apply. There is a section in the online graduate application form where you will be able to enter the code(s), if required, for any studentships for which you wish to be considered. If a code is required it will be provided on the relevant department's website.\nOverviewFunding for graduate courses is competitive, but the University of Oxford offers more support than you might think. For example, for the 2023-24 academic year, just over 45% of our new graduate students received full or partial funding from the University or other funders.This page provides more information on the range of funding the University offers through scholarships, Research Councils and studentships.When undertaking your funding search you should consider the following:Do not delay! Start thinking about the different funding options available to you as soon as you decide to apply to Oxford – do not wait until you have an offer of a place. You need to ensure you have funding in place in good time to start your course.Look for funding from both the University of Oxford and external sources. Receiving an offer of a place to study at Oxford does not necessarily mean that we can also offer you funding. However, there are a range of other options open to our graduate students. After you have read all the sections on this page about the scholarships, Research Council funding and studentships that the University offers, we also recommend you research external funding and loans for which you may be eligible.Do not wait until you get here to think about funding for future years. The vast majority of Oxford scholarships are open to new graduate students only.

HOW THE UNIVERSITY USES YOUR DATA      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore you submit your application, we process your data in order to administer our application process, such as to investigate a problem reported by you. Once you submit your application, we process your data for the purpose of processing and assessing your application for study, and for purposes related to your application, such as assessing your eligibility for funding and your financial status or to verify information you have supplied to us in your application (e.g., regarding previous qualifications).\nWe set out below those circumstances where it is necessary for us to process your data. (These circumstances are not mutually exclusive; we may use the same information under more than one heading.)\n6.1 Because we have a contractual obligation to consider your application\nInformation processed for this purpose includes the data listed in section 4 above.  \nWe also need to process data under this heading where the University is working with a third party in order to offer you services, for example, those offered by Colleges, sponsors (such as research councils), other universities or scholarship benefactors. See section 8 for a fuller list of examples of third party sharing.  \n6.2 Where we need to comply with a legal obligation\nInformation processed for this purpose includes, but is not limited to, information relating to the monitoring of equal opportunities and information provided to regulatory bodies including the General Medical Council, the Office for Students and the OIA.  We are also required by law to provide data to the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) which shares information with public authorities that are required to carry out their statutory and/or public functions.\n6.3 Where it is necessary to meet our legitimate interests\nWe also need to process your data in order to meet our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of others. Examples include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nsending you communications containing information on how to complete your application;\nmonitoring and researching equal opportunities and admissions statistics; \ninviting you to take part in applicant surveys or enabling third parties to conduct applicant surveys on our behalf;\nnotifying you of changes to course information;\nsending specific communications to applicants likely to be affected by major incidents (e.g. natural disasters or conflicts in a specific country/region).\n\n6.4 Where we have your consent\nThere may be situations where we ask for your consent to process your data, for example the socio-economic questions in the application form (where a \"Prefer not to say\" option is available) and pre-application communications for student recruitment purposes (you will always be able to opt out of receiving such communications).\nIf you fail to provide personal information under 6.1 or 6.2 above\nIf you fail to provide certain information when requested under the circumstances described in 6.1 and 6.2 above, we may not be able to meet our contractual obligation to consider your application or to comply with our other legal obligations.\nChange of purpose\nWe will only process your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another related reason, and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use your data for an unrelated purpose, we will seek your consent to use it for that new purpose.\nPlease note that we may process your data without your knowledge or consent where this is required or permitted by law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        7.

Listed below are examples of processing activities that we regularly undertake in respect of these types of data.  In addition to the activities listed below, it may sometimes be necessary to process this sort of information for exceptional reasons, for example, because it is necessary to protect your vital interests or those of another person or for safeguarding purposes.  We may also process your special category data to identify your eligibility for certain scholarships (e.g., female only STEM scholarships).\n7.1 Health (including disability)\nWe will process data about your health where it is necessary to make reasonable adjustments for disability (e.g., to arrange access for interviews) and/or to monitor equal opportunities. This processing is necessary to meet our legal obligations.\n7.2 Criminal conduct\nData about relevant criminal convictions, including whether or not you have such a conviction, is gathered during the process of applying for a course with us once you have been offered a place. Data about barring decisions will only be collected if you have applied for and been accepted onto certain courses, and where we are legally required to do so. Processing of this nature is carried out in order to protect our legitimate interests including to protect members of the University community from a foreseeable risk of harm. For certain courses this processing is also necessary to meet our legal obligations. Such processing will be subject to suitable safeguards.\n7.3 Racial or ethnic origin, sexual orientation and religious belief\nData about your racial and ethnic origin, religious belief or sexual orientation will only be processed where you have volunteered it, including in order to identify your eligibility for certain scholarships in accordance with our legitimate interests, and/or where we need to process it in order to meet our statutory obligations under equality and/or other legislation. This processing is considered to meet a substantial public interest, and will be subject to suitable safeguards.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        8.

(These circumstances are not mutually exclusive; we may use the same information under more than one heading.)\n6.1 Because we have a contractual obligation to consider your application\nInformation processed for this purpose includes the data listed in section 4 above.  \nWe also need to process data under this heading where the University is working with a third party in order to offer you services, for example, those offered by Colleges, sponsors (such as research councils), other universities or scholarship benefactors.

If we need to use your data for an unrelated purpose, we will seek your consent to use it for that new purpose.\nPlease note that we may process your data without your knowledge or consent where this is required or permitted by law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        7.

Data about barring decisions will only be collected if you have applied for and been accepted onto certain courses, and where we are legally required to do so. Processing of this nature is carried out in order to protect our legitimate interests including to protect members of the University community from a foreseeable risk of harm. For certain courses this processing is also necessary to meet our legal obligations. Such processing will be subject to suitable safeguards.\n7.3 Racial or ethnic origin, sexual orientation and religious belief\nData about your racial and ethnic origin, religious belief or sexual orientation will only be processed where you have volunteered it, including in order to identify your eligibility for certain scholarships in accordance with our legitimate interests, and/or where we need to process it in order to meet our statutory obligations under equality and/or other legislation.

(These circumstances are not mutually exclusive; we may use the same information under more than one heading.)\n6.1 Because we have a contractual obligation to consider your application\nInformation processed for this purpose includes the data listed in section 4 above.  \nWe also need to process data under this heading where the University is working with a third party in order to offer you services, for example, those offered by Colleges, sponsors (such as research councils), other universities or scholarship benefactors. See section 8 for a fuller list of examples of third party sharing.  \n6.2 Where we need to comply with a legal obligation\nInformation processed for this purpose includes, but is not limited to, information relating to the monitoring of equal opportunities and information provided to regulatory bodies including the General Medical Council, the Office for Students and the OIA.  We are also required by law to provide data to the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) which shares information with public authorities that are required to carry out their statutory and/or public functions.\n6.3 Where it is necessary to meet our legitimate interests\nWe also need to process your data in order to meet our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of others. Examples include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nsending you communications containing information on how to complete your application;\nmonitoring and researching equal opportunities and admissions statistics; \ninviting you to take part in applicant surveys or enabling third parties to conduct applicant surveys on our behalf;\nnotifying you of changes to course information;\nsending specific communications to applicants likely to be affected by major incidents (e.g. natural disasters or conflicts in a specific country/region).\n\n6.4 Where we have your consent\nThere may be situations where we ask for your consent to process your data, for example the socio-economic questions in the application form (where a \"Prefer not to say\" option is available) and pre-application communications for student recruitment purposes (you will always be able to opt out of receiving such communications).\nIf you fail to provide personal information under 6.1 or 6.2 above\nIf you fail to provide certain information when requested under the circumstances described in 6.1 and 6.2 above, we may not be able to meet our contractual obligation to consider your application or to comply with our other legal obligations.\nChange of purpose\nWe will only process your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another related reason, and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use your data for an unrelated purpose, we will seek your consent to use it for that new purpose.\nPlease note that we may process your data without your knowledge or consent where this is required or permitted by law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        7. SPECIAL CATEGORY DATA AND CRIMINAL CONVICTION DATA      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial category data and criminal conviction data require a higher level of protection. Listed below are examples of processing activities that we regularly undertake in respect of these types of data.  In addition to the activities listed below, it may sometimes be necessary to process this sort of information for exceptional reasons, for example, because it is necessary to protect your vital interests or those of another person or for safeguarding purposes.  We may also process your special category data to identify your eligibility for certain scholarships (e.g., female only STEM scholarships).\n7.1 Health (including disability)\nWe will process data about your health where it is necessary to make reasonable adjustments for disability (e.g., to arrange access for interviews) and/or to monitor equal opportunities. This processing is necessary to meet our legal obligations.\n7.2 Criminal conduct\nData about relevant criminal convictions, including whether or not you have such a conviction, is gathered during the process of applying for a course with us once you have been offered a place. Data about barring decisions will only be collected if you have applied for and been accepted onto certain courses, and where we are legally required to do so. Processing of this nature is carried out in order to protect our legitimate interests including to protect members of the University community from a foreseeable risk of harm. For certain courses this processing is also necessary to meet our legal obligations. Such processing will be subject to suitable safeguards.\n7.3 Racial or ethnic origin, sexual orientation and religious belief\nData about your racial and ethnic origin, religious belief or sexual orientation will only be processed where you have volunteered it, including in order to identify your eligibility for certain scholarships in accordance with our legitimate interests, and/or where we need to process it in order to meet our statutory obligations under equality and/or other legislation. This processing is considered to meet a substantial public interest, and will be subject to suitable safeguards.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        8. DATA SHARING WITH THIRD PARTIES      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to perform our contractual and other legal responsibilities or purposes, we may, need to share your information with the following types of organisation:\n\nColleges (including Private Permanent Halls (PPHs), in order to support your college placement (where applicable) and enhance your student experience;\nExternal organisations providing services to us, for example qualification verification services, and our enquiry management and plagiarism detection systems;  \nExternal organisations offering University-sponsored services including student surveys;\nThe governmental departments or agencies responsible for immigration and student loans;\nThird parties including your former employer(s) or educational establishment(s) to obtain a reference or to verify the accuracy of a reference or other information you have submitted with or in support of your application;\nIf you have or are seeking a particular relationship with a third party, for example, because of an exchange scheme;\nSponsors or benefactors of funding and financial support;\nOther Higher Education institutions as part of formal partnerships; \nThe Office for the Independent Adjudicator (OIA); \nWhere information is shared with third parties, we will seek to share the minimum amount necessary.\n\nAll third-party service providers that process data on our behalf are required to take appropriate security measures to protect your data in line with our policies.

TRANSFERS OF YOUR DATA OVERSEAS       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere may be occasions when we transfer your data overseas, for example, to obtain a reference or to verify information in your application. Such transfers will only take place if one of the following applies:\n\nthe country receiving the data is considered by the UK to provide an adequate level of data protection, this includes countries in the European Economic Area;\nthe organisation receiving the data is covered by an arrangement recognised by the UK as providing an adequate standard of data protection;\nthe transfer has your consent;\nthe transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract with you or to take steps requested by you prior to entering into that contract; \nthe transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract with another person, which is in your interests;\nthe transfer is governed by approved contractual clauses; or\nthe transfer is necessary for important reasons of public interest. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        10.

This means that we decide how to use it and are responsible for looking after it in accordance with the UK GDPR.\nAccess to your data will be provided to and shared between the academic and support staff, including those based in the University’s colleges[1], who need to view it as part of their work in carrying out the purposes set out in Section 6.

HOW THE UNIVERSITY USES YOUR DATA      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore you submit your application, we process your data in order to administer our application process, such as to investigate a problem reported by you. Once you submit your application, we process your data for the purpose of processing and assessing your application for study, and for purposes related to your application, such as assessing your eligibility for funding and your financial status or to verify information you have supplied to us in your application (e.g., regarding previous qualifications).\nWe set out below those circumstances where it is necessary for us to process your data. (These circumstances are not mutually exclusive; we may use the same information under more than one heading.)\n6.1 Because we have a contractual obligation to consider your application\nInformation processed for this purpose includes the data listed in section 4 above.  \nWe also need to process data under this heading where the University is working with a third party in order to offer you services, for example, those offered by Colleges, sponsors (such as research councils), other universities or scholarship benefactors. See section 8 for a fuller list of examples of third party sharing.  \n6.2 Where we need to comply with a legal obligation\nInformation processed for this purpose includes, but is not limited to, information relating to the monitoring of equal opportunities and information provided to regulatory bodies including the General Medical Council, the Office for Students and the OIA.  We are also required by law to provide data to the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) which shares information with public authorities that are required to carry out their statutory and/or public functions.\n6.3 Where it is necessary to meet our legitimate interests\nWe also need to process your data in order to meet our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of others. Examples include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nsending you communications containing information on how to complete your application;\nmonitoring and researching equal opportunities and admissions statistics; \ninviting you to take part in applicant surveys or enabling third parties to conduct applicant surveys on our behalf;\nnotifying you of changes to course information;\nsending specific communications to applicants likely to be affected by major incidents (e.g. natural disasters or conflicts in a specific country/region).\n\n6.4 Where we have your consent\nThere may be situations where we ask for your consent to process your data, for example the socio-economic questions in the application form (where a \"Prefer not to say\" option is available) and pre-application communications for student recruitment purposes (you will always be able to opt out of receiving such communications).\nIf you fail to provide personal information under 6.1 or 6.2 above\nIf you fail to provide certain information when requested under the circumstances described in 6.1 and 6.2 above, we may not be able to meet our contractual obligation to consider your application or to comply with our other legal obligations.\nChange of purpose\nWe will only process your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another related reason, and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use your data for an unrelated purpose, we will seek your consent to use it for that new purpose.\nPlease note that we may process your data without your knowledge or consent where this is required or permitted by law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        7. SPECIAL CATEGORY DATA AND CRIMINAL CONVICTION DATA      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial category data and criminal conviction data require a higher level of protection. Listed below are examples of processing activities that we regularly undertake in respect of these types of data.  In addition to the activities listed below, it may sometimes be necessary to process this sort of information for exceptional reasons, for example, because it is necessary to protect your vital interests or those of another person or for safeguarding purposes.  We may also process your special category data to identify your eligibility for certain scholarships (e.g., female only STEM scholarships).\n7.1 Health (including disability)\nWe will process data about your health where it is necessary to make reasonable adjustments for disability (e.g., to arrange access for interviews) and/or to monitor equal opportunities. This processing is necessary to meet our legal obligations.\n7.2 Criminal conduct\nData about relevant criminal convictions, including whether or not you have such a conviction, is gathered during the process of applying for a course with us once you have been offered a place. Data about barring decisions will only be collected if you have applied for and been accepted onto certain courses, and where we are legally required to do so. Processing of this nature is carried out in order to protect our legitimate interests including to protect members of the University community from a foreseeable risk of harm. For certain courses this processing is also necessary to meet our legal obligations. Such processing will be subject to suitable safeguards.\n7.3 Racial or ethnic origin, sexual orientation and religious belief\nData about your racial and ethnic origin, religious belief or sexual orientation will only be processed where you have volunteered it, including in order to identify your eligibility for certain scholarships in accordance with our legitimate interests, and/or where we need to process it in order to meet our statutory obligations under equality and/or other legislation. This processing is considered to meet a substantial public interest, and will be subject to suitable safeguards.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        8. DATA SHARING WITH THIRD PARTIES      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to perform our contractual and other legal responsibilities or purposes, we may, need to share your information with the following types of organisation:\n\nColleges (including Private Permanent Halls (PPHs), in order to support your college placement (where applicable) and enhance your student experience;\nExternal organisations providing services to us, for example qualification verification services, and our enquiry management and plagiarism detection systems;  \nExternal organisations offering University-sponsored services including student surveys;\nThe governmental departments or agencies responsible for immigration and student loans;\nThird parties including your former employer(s) or educational establishment(s) to obtain a reference or to verify the accuracy of a reference or other information you have submitted with or in support of your application;\nIf you have or are seeking a particular relationship with a third party, for example, because of an exchange scheme;\nSponsors or benefactors of funding and financial support;\nOther Higher Education institutions as part of formal partnerships; \nThe Office for the Independent Adjudicator (OIA); \nWhere information is shared with third parties, we will seek to share the minimum amount necessary.\n\nAll third-party service providers that process data on our behalf are required to take appropriate security measures to protect your data in line with our policies.

This enables you to receive a copy of your data and to check that we are lawfully processing it.\nRequest correction of your data. This enables you to ask us to correct any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you.\nRequest erasure of your data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove your data in certain circumstances, for example, if you consider that there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your data where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below).\nObject to processing of your data where we are relying on our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground.

HOW THE UNIVERSITY USES YOUR DATA      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore you submit your application, we process your data in order to administer our application process, such as to investigate a problem reported by you. Once you submit your application, we process your data for the purpose of processing and assessing your application for study, and for purposes related to your application, such as assessing your eligibility for funding and your financial status or to verify information you have supplied to us in your application (e.g., regarding previous qualifications).\nWe set out below those circumstances where it is necessary for us to process your data. (These circumstances are not mutually exclusive; we may use the same information under more than one heading.)\n6.1 Because we have a contractual obligation to consider your application\nInformation processed for this purpose includes the data listed in section 4 above.  \nWe also need to process data under this heading where the University is working with a third party in order to offer you services, for example, those offered by Colleges, sponsors (such as research councils), other universities or scholarship benefactors.

(These circumstances are not mutually exclusive; we may use the same information under more than one heading.)\n6.1 Because we have a contractual obligation to consider your application\nInformation processed for this purpose includes the data listed in section 4 above.  \nWe also need to process data under this heading where the University is working with a third party in order to offer you services, for example, those offered by Colleges, sponsors (such as research councils), other universities or scholarship benefactors.

If we need to use your data for an unrelated purpose, we will seek your consent to use it for that new purpose.\nPlease note that we may process your data without your knowledge or consent where this is required or permitted by law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        7.

Data about barring decisions will only be collected if you have applied for and been accepted onto certain courses, and where we are legally required to do so. Processing of this nature is carried out in order to protect our legitimate interests including to protect members of the University community from a foreseeable risk of harm. For certain courses this processing is also necessary to meet our legal obligations. Such processing will be subject to suitable safeguards.\n7.3 Racial or ethnic origin, sexual orientation and religious belief\nData about your racial and ethnic origin, religious belief or sexual orientation will only be processed where you have volunteered it, including in order to identify your eligibility for certain scholarships in accordance with our legitimate interests, and/or where we need to process it in order to meet our statutory obligations under equality and/or other legislation.

(These circumstances are not mutually exclusive; we may use the same information under more than one heading.)\n6.1 Because we have a contractual obligation to consider your application\nInformation processed for this purpose includes the data listed in section 4 above.  \nWe also need to process data under this heading where the University is working with a third party in order to offer you services, for example, those offered by Colleges, sponsors (such as research councils), other universities or scholarship benefactors. See section 8 for a fuller list of examples of third party sharing.  \n6.2 Where we need to comply with a legal obligation\nInformation processed for this purpose includes, but is not limited to, information relating to the monitoring of equal opportunities and information provided to regulatory bodies including the General Medical Council, the Office for Students and the OIA.  We are also required by law to provide data to the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) which shares information with public authorities that are required to carry out their statutory and/or public functions.\n6.3 Where it is necessary to meet our legitimate interests\nWe also need to process your data in order to meet our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of others. Examples include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nsending you communications containing information on how to complete your application;\nmonitoring and researching equal opportunities and admissions statistics; \ninviting you to take part in applicant surveys or enabling third parties to conduct applicant surveys on our behalf;\nnotifying you of changes to course information;\nsending specific communications to applicants likely to be affected by major incidents (e.g. natural disasters or conflicts in a specific country/region).\n\n6.4 Where we have your consent\nThere may be situations where we ask for your consent to process your data, for example the socio-economic questions in the application form (where a \"Prefer not to say\" option is available) and pre-application communications for student recruitment purposes (you will always be able to opt out of receiving such communications).\nIf you fail to provide personal information under 6.1 or 6.2 above\nIf you fail to provide certain information when requested under the circumstances described in 6.1 and 6.2 above, we may not be able to meet our contractual obligation to consider your application or to comply with our other legal obligations.\nChange of purpose\nWe will only process your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another related reason, and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use your data for an unrelated purpose, we will seek your consent to use it for that new purpose.\nPlease note that we may process your data without your knowledge or consent where this is required or permitted by law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        7. SPECIAL CATEGORY DATA AND CRIMINAL CONVICTION DATA      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial category data and criminal conviction data require a higher level of protection. Listed below are examples of processing activities that we regularly undertake in respect of these types of data.  In addition to the activities listed below, it may sometimes be necessary to process this sort of information for exceptional reasons, for example, because it is necessary to protect your vital interests or those of another person or for safeguarding purposes.  We may also process your special category data to identify your eligibility for certain scholarships (e.g., female only STEM scholarships).\n7.1 Health (including disability)\nWe will process data about your health where it is necessary to make reasonable adjustments for disability (e.g., to arrange access for interviews) and/or to monitor equal opportunities. This processing is necessary to meet our legal obligations.\n7.2 Criminal conduct\nData about relevant criminal convictions, including whether or not you have such a conviction, is gathered during the process of applying for a course with us once you have been offered a place. Data about barring decisions will only be collected if you have applied for and been accepted onto certain courses, and where we are legally required to do so. Processing of this nature is carried out in order to protect our legitimate interests including to protect members of the University community from a foreseeable risk of harm. For certain courses this processing is also necessary to meet our legal obligations. Such processing will be subject to suitable safeguards.\n7.3 Racial or ethnic origin, sexual orientation and religious belief\nData about your racial and ethnic origin, religious belief or sexual orientation will only be processed where you have volunteered it, including in order to identify your eligibility for certain scholarships in accordance with our legitimate interests, and/or where we need to process it in order to meet our statutory obligations under equality and/or other legislation. This processing is considered to meet a substantial public interest, and will be subject to suitable safeguards.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        8.

We permit them to process your data only for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        9. TRANSFERS OF YOUR DATA OVERSEAS       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere may be occasions when we transfer your data overseas, for example, to obtain a reference or to verify information in your application. Such transfers will only take place if one of the following applies:\n\nthe country receiving the data is considered by the UK to provide an adequate level of data protection, this includes countries in the European Economic Area;\nthe organisation receiving the data is covered by an arrangement recognised by the UK as providing an adequate standard of data protection;\nthe transfer has your consent;\nthe transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract with you or to take steps requested by you prior to entering into that contract; \nthe transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract with another person, which is in your interests;\nthe transfer is governed by approved contractual clauses; or\nthe transfer is necessary for important reasons of public interest. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        10.

Once you submit your application, we process your data for the purpose of processing and assessing your application for study, and for purposes related to your application, such as assessing your eligibility for funding and your financial status or to verify information you have supplied to us in your application (e.g., regarding previous qualifications).\nWe set out below those circumstances where it is necessary for us to process your data. (These circumstances are not mutually exclusive; we may use the same information under more than one heading.)\n6.1 Because we have a contractual obligation to consider your application\nInformation processed for this purpose includes the data listed in section 4 above.  \nWe also need to process data under this heading where the University is working with a third party in order to offer you services, for example, those offered by Colleges, sponsors (such as research councils), other universities or scholarship benefactors. See section 8 for a fuller list of examples of third party sharing.  \n6.2 Where we need to comply with a legal obligation\nInformation processed for this purpose includes, but is not limited to, information relating to the monitoring of equal opportunities and information provided to regulatory bodies including the General Medical Council, the Office for Students and the OIA.  We are also required by law to provide data to the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) which shares information with public authorities that are required to carry out their statutory and/or public functions.\n6.3 Where it is necessary to meet our legitimate interests\nWe also need to process your data in order to meet our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of others.

If we need to use your data for an unrelated purpose, we will seek your consent to use it for that new purpose.\nPlease note that we may process your data without your knowledge or consent where this is required or permitted by law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        7.

Data about barring decisions will only be collected if you have applied for and been accepted onto certain courses, and where we are legally required to do so. Processing of this nature is carried out in order to protect our legitimate interests including to protect members of the University community from a foreseeable risk of harm. For certain courses this processing is also necessary to meet our legal obligations. Such processing will be subject to suitable safeguards.\n7.3 Racial or ethnic origin, sexual orientation and religious belief\nData about your racial and ethnic origin, religious belief or sexual orientation will only be processed where you have volunteered it, including in order to identify your eligibility for certain scholarships in accordance with our legitimate interests, and/or where we need to process it in order to meet our statutory obligations under equality and/or other legislation.

HOW THE UNIVERSITY USES YOUR DATA\nBefore you submit your application, we process your data in order to administer our application process, such as to investigate a problem reported by you. Once you submit your application, we process your data for the purpose of processing and assessing your application for study, and for purposes related to your application, such as assessing your eligibility for funding and your financial status or to verify information you have supplied to us in your application (e.g., regarding previous qualifications).\nWe set out below those circumstances where it is necessary for us to process your data. (These circumstances are not mutually exclusive; we may use the same information under more than one heading.)\n6.1 Because we have a contractual obligation to consider your application\nInformation processed for this purpose includes the data listed in section 4 above.  \nWe also need to process data under this heading where the University is working with a third party in order to offer you services, for example, those offered by Colleges, sponsors (such as research councils), other universities or scholarship benefactors.

HOW THE UNIVERSITY USES YOUR DATA      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore you submit your application, we process your data in order to administer our application process, such as to investigate a problem reported by you. Once you submit your application, we process your data for the purpose of processing and assessing your application for study, and for purposes related to your application, such as assessing your eligibility for funding and your financial status or to verify information you have supplied to us in your application (e.g., regarding previous qualifications).\nWe set out below those circumstances where it is necessary for us to process your data. (These circumstances are not mutually exclusive; we may use the same information under more than one heading.)\n6.1 Because we have a contractual obligation to consider your application\nInformation processed for this purpose includes the data listed in section 4 above.  \nWe also need to process data under this heading where the University is working with a third party in order to offer you services, for example, those offered by Colleges, sponsors (such as research councils), other universities or scholarship benefactors. See section 8 for a fuller list of examples of third party sharing.  \n6.2 Where we need to comply with a legal obligation\nInformation processed for this purpose includes, but is not limited to, information relating to the monitoring of equal opportunities and information provided to regulatory bodies including the General Medical Council, the Office for Students and the OIA.  We are also required by law to provide data to the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) which shares information with public authorities that are required to carry out their statutory and/or public functions.\n6.3 Where it is necessary to meet our legitimate interests\nWe also need to process your data in order to meet our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of others. Examples include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nsending you communications containing information on how to complete your application;\nmonitoring and researching equal opportunities and admissions statistics; \ninviting you to take part in applicant surveys or enabling third parties to conduct applicant surveys on our behalf;\nnotifying you of changes to course information;\nsending specific communications to applicants likely to be affected by major incidents (e.g. natural disasters or conflicts in a specific country/region).\n\n6.4 Where we have your consent\nThere may be situations where we ask for your consent to process your data, for example the socio-economic questions in the application form (where a \"Prefer not to say\" option is available) and pre-application communications for student recruitment purposes (you will always be able to opt out of receiving such communications).\nIf you fail to provide personal information under 6.1 or 6.2 above\nIf you fail to provide certain information when requested under the circumstances described in 6.1 and 6.2 above, we may not be able to meet our contractual obligation to consider your application or to comply with our other legal obligations.\nChange of purpose\nWe will only process your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another related reason, and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use your data for an unrelated purpose, we will seek your consent to use it for that new purpose.\nPlease note that we may process your data without your knowledge or consent where this is required or permitted by law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        7. SPECIAL CATEGORY DATA AND CRIMINAL CONVICTION DATA      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial category data and criminal conviction data require a higher level of protection. Listed below are examples of processing activities that we regularly undertake in respect of these types of data.  In addition to the activities listed below, it may sometimes be necessary to process this sort of information for exceptional reasons, for example, because it is necessary to protect your vital interests or those of another person or for safeguarding purposes.  We may also process your special category data to identify your eligibility for certain scholarships (e.g., female only STEM scholarships).\n7.1 Health (including disability)\nWe will process data about your health where it is necessary to make reasonable adjustments for disability (e.g., to arrange access for interviews) and/or to monitor equal opportunities. This processing is necessary to meet our legal obligations.\n7.2 Criminal conduct\nData about relevant criminal convictions, including whether or not you have such a conviction, is gathered during the process of applying for a course with us once you have been offered a place. Data about barring decisions will only be collected if you have applied for and been accepted onto certain courses, and where we are legally required to do so. Processing of this nature is carried out in order to protect our legitimate interests including to protect members of the University community from a foreseeable risk of harm. For certain courses this processing is also necessary to meet our legal obligations. Such processing will be subject to suitable safeguards.\n7.3 Racial or ethnic origin, sexual orientation and religious belief\nData about your racial and ethnic origin, religious belief or sexual orientation will only be processed where you have volunteered it, including in order to identify your eligibility for certain scholarships in accordance with our legitimate interests, and/or where we need to process it in order to meet our statutory obligations under equality and/or other legislation. This processing is considered to meet a substantial public interest, and will be subject to suitable safeguards.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        8. DATA SHARING WITH THIRD PARTIES      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to perform our contractual and other legal responsibilities or purposes, we may, need to share your information with the following types of organisation:\n\nColleges (including Private Permanent Halls (PPHs), in order to support your college placement (where applicable) and enhance your student experience;\nExternal organisations providing services to us, for example qualification verification services, and our enquiry management and plagiarism detection systems;  \nExternal organisations offering University-sponsored services including student surveys;\nThe governmental departments or agencies responsible for immigration and student loans;\nThird parties including your former employer(s) or educational establishment(s) to obtain a reference or to verify the accuracy of a reference or other information you have submitted with or in support of your application;\nIf you have or are seeking a particular relationship with a third party, for example, because of an exchange scheme;\nSponsors or benefactors of funding and financial support;\nOther Higher Education institutions as part of formal partnerships; \nThe Office for the Independent Adjudicator (OIA); \nWhere information is shared with third parties, we will seek to share the minimum amount necessary.\n\nAll third-party service providers that process data on our behalf are required to take appropriate security measures to protect your data in line with our policies.

(These circumstances are not mutually exclusive; we may use the same information under more than one heading.)\n6.1 Because we have a contractual obligation to consider your application\nInformation processed for this purpose includes the data listed in section 4 above.  \nWe also need to process data under this heading where the University is working with a third party in order to offer you services, for example, those offered by Colleges, sponsors (such as research councils), other universities or scholarship benefactors.

If we need to use your data for an unrelated purpose, we will seek your consent to use it for that new purpose.\nPlease note that we may process your data without your knowledge or consent where this is required or permitted by law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        7.

Data about barring decisions will only be collected if you have applied for and been accepted onto certain courses, and where we are legally required to do so. Processing of this nature is carried out in order to protect our legitimate interests including to protect members of the University community from a foreseeable risk of harm. For certain courses this processing is also necessary to meet our legal obligations. Such processing will be subject to suitable safeguards.\n7.3 Racial or ethnic origin, sexual orientation and religious belief\nData about your racial and ethnic origin, religious belief or sexual orientation will only be processed where you have volunteered it, including in order to identify your eligibility for certain scholarships in accordance with our legitimate interests, and/or where we need to process it in order to meet our statutory obligations under equality and/or other legislation.

HOW THE UNIVERSITY USES YOUR DATA      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore you submit your application, we process your data in order to administer our application process, such as to investigate a problem reported by you. Once you submit your application, we process your data for the purpose of processing and assessing your application for study, and for purposes related to your application, such as assessing your eligibility for funding and your financial status or to verify information you have supplied to us in your application (e.g., regarding previous qualifications).\nWe set out below those circumstances where it is necessary for us to process your data. (These circumstances are not mutually exclusive; we may use the same information under more than one heading.)\n6.1 Because we have a contractual obligation to consider your application\nInformation processed for this purpose includes the data listed in section 4 above.  \nWe also need to process data under this heading where the University is working with a third party in order to offer you services, for example, those offered by Colleges, sponsors (such as research councils), other universities or scholarship benefactors. See section 8 for a fuller list of examples of third party sharing.  \n6.2 Where we need to comply with a legal obligation\nInformation processed for this purpose includes, but is not limited to, information relating to the monitoring of equal opportunities and information provided to regulatory bodies including the General Medical Council, the Office for Students and the OIA.  We are also required by law to provide data to the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) which shares information with public authorities that are required to carry out their statutory and/or public functions.\n6.3 Where it is necessary to meet our legitimate interests\nWe also need to process your data in order to meet our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of others. Examples include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nsending you communications containing information on how to complete your application;\nmonitoring and researching equal opportunities and admissions statistics; \ninviting you to take part in applicant surveys or enabling third parties to conduct applicant surveys on our behalf;\nnotifying you of changes to course information;\nsending specific communications to applicants likely to be affected by major incidents (e.g. natural disasters or conflicts in a specific country/region).\n\n6.4 Where we have your consent\nThere may be situations where we ask for your consent to process your data, for example the socio-economic questions in the application form (where a \"Prefer not to say\" option is available) and pre-application communications for student recruitment purposes (you will always be able to opt out of receiving such communications).\nIf you fail to provide personal information under 6.1 or 6.2 above\nIf you fail to provide certain information when requested under the circumstances described in 6.1 and 6.2 above, we may not be able to meet our contractual obligation to consider your application or to comply with our other legal obligations.\nChange of purpose\nWe will only process your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another related reason, and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use your data for an unrelated purpose, we will seek your consent to use it for that new purpose.\nPlease note that we may process your data without your knowledge or consent where this is required or permitted by law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        7. SPECIAL CATEGORY DATA AND CRIMINAL CONVICTION DATA      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial category data and criminal conviction data require a higher level of protection. Listed below are examples of processing activities that we regularly undertake in respect of these types of data.  In addition to the activities listed below, it may sometimes be necessary to process this sort of information for exceptional reasons, for example, because it is necessary to protect your vital interests or those of another person or for safeguarding purposes.  We may also process your special category data to identify your eligibility for certain scholarships (e.g., female only STEM scholarships).\n7.1 Health (including disability)\nWe will process data about your health where it is necessary to make reasonable adjustments for disability (e.g., to arrange access for interviews) and/or to monitor equal opportunities. This processing is necessary to meet our legal obligations.\n7.2 Criminal conduct\nData about relevant criminal convictions, including whether or not you have such a conviction, is gathered during the process of applying for a course with us once you have been offered a place. Data about barring decisions will only be collected if you have applied for and been accepted onto certain courses, and where we are legally required to do so. Processing of this nature is carried out in order to protect our legitimate interests including to protect members of the University community from a foreseeable risk of harm. For certain courses this processing is also necessary to meet our legal obligations. Such processing will be subject to suitable safeguards.\n7.3 Racial or ethnic origin, sexual orientation and religious belief\nData about your racial and ethnic origin, religious belief or sexual orientation will only be processed where you have volunteered it, including in order to identify your eligibility for certain scholarships in accordance with our legitimate interests, and/or where we need to process it in order to meet our statutory obligations under equality and/or other legislation. This processing is considered to meet a substantial public interest, and will be subject to suitable safeguards.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        8. DATA SHARING WITH THIRD PARTIES      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to perform our contractual and other legal responsibilities or purposes, we may, need to share your information with the following types of organisation:\n\nColleges (including Private Permanent Halls (PPHs), in order to support your college placement (where applicable) and enhance your student experience;\nExternal organisations providing services to us, for example qualification verification services, and our enquiry management and plagiarism detection systems;  \nExternal organisations offering University-sponsored services including student surveys;\nThe governmental departments or agencies responsible for immigration and student loans;\nThird parties including your former employer(s) or educational establishment(s) to obtain a reference or to verify the accuracy of a reference or other information you have submitted with or in support of your application;\nIf you have or are seeking a particular relationship with a third party, for example, because of an exchange scheme;\nSponsors or benefactors of funding and financial support;\nOther Higher Education institutions as part of formal partnerships; \nThe Office for the Independent Adjudicator (OIA); \nWhere information is shared with third parties, we will seek to share the minimum amount necessary.\n\nAll third-party service providers that process data on our behalf are required to take appropriate security measures to protect your data in line with our policies.

WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT?      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe University of Oxford is committed to protecting the privacy and security of your personal information (‘personal data’).\nThis privacy policy describes how we collect and use your personal data during the application process, both before and after you submit your application, in accordance with the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) and related UK data protection legislation.\nThis policy applies to prospective postgraduate students.

WHO IS USING YOUR PERSONAL DATA?      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe University of Oxford[2] is the “data controller\" for the information that we obtain from you or others as a result of your application for graduate study. This means that we decide how to use it and are responsible for looking after it in accordance with the UK GDPR.\nAccess to your data will be provided to and shared between the academic and support staff, including those based in the University’s colleges[1], who need to view it as part of their work in carrying out the purposes set out in Section 6. We also share it with the third parties described in section 8.\n[2] The University’s legal title is the Chancellor, Masters and Scholars of the University of Oxford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        4. THE TYPES OF DATA WE HOLD ABOUT YOU      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe information we hold about you may include the following:\n\nPersonal details such as name, title, address, telephone number, email address, date of birth, legal sex and gender identity, ID photograph (included within received documents),  marital status, information about household income, and details of dependants;\nEducation and employment information (including the school(s), sixth form college(s) and other colleges or universities you have attended and places where you have worked, the courses you have completed, dates of study and examination results);\nOther personal background information collected during the admissions process, e.g. whether you have been in care, your socio-economic classification and details of your parents’ occupation and education;\nCorrespondence to or from the University, or a College, during the admissions process; \nInformation about your use of our IT systems;\nVisa, passport and immigration information;\nFunding and financial support information;\nYour feedback on the application process and university services collected through surveys such as (but not limited to) those sent to applicants and offer-holders; \nAttendance records at University organised recruitment events, and photographic data of such events captured for the purpose of live streaming and/or future publicity materials;\nInformation about your use of our information and communications systems, including your communication preferences and website interaction (cookies and similar technologies);\nInformation about your socio-economic background; and\nInformation we obtain from third parties relevant to verifying information supplied in your application (e.g. from referees or previous educational institutions). \n\nWe may also process the following \"special categories\" of more sensitive personal data:\n\nInformation about your race or ethnicity, sexual orientation and religious beliefs;\nInformation about your health, including any disability and/or medical condition;\nInformation about criminal convictions and offences, including proceedings or allegations .\n\nSpecial category data will only be used in accordance with section 7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        5. HOW THE UNIVERSITY OBTAINED YOUR DATA      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe collect the vast majority of the information directly from you, such as during your registration to use our online application form, through the application process and after you submit your application. We may also collect additional information from third parties and their staff, including referees, former schools, colleges and universities, and government departments and agencies. We may also collect information about you which is in the public domain. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        6. HOW THE UNIVERSITY USES YOUR DATA      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore you submit your application, we process your data in order to administer our application process, such as to investigate a problem reported by you. Once you submit your application, we process your data for the purpose of processing and assessing your application for study, and for purposes related to your application, such as assessing your eligibility for funding and your financial status or to verify information you have supplied to us in your application (e.g., regarding previous qualifications).\nWe set out below those circumstances where it is necessary for us to process your data. (These circumstances are not mutually exclusive; we may use the same information under more than one heading.)\n6.1 Because we have a contractual obligation to consider your application\nInformation processed for this purpose includes the data listed in section 4 above.  \nWe also need to process data under this heading where the University is working with a third party in order to offer you services, for example, those offered by Colleges, sponsors (such as research councils), other universities or scholarship benefactors. See section 8 for a fuller list of examples of third party sharing.  \n6.2 Where we need to comply with a legal obligation\nInformation processed for this purpose includes, but is not limited to, information relating to the monitoring of equal opportunities and information provided to regulatory bodies including the General Medical Council, the Office for Students and the OIA.  We are also required by law to provide data to the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) which shares information with public authorities that are required to carry out their statutory and/or public functions.\n6.3 Where it is necessary to meet our legitimate interests\nWe also need to process your data in order to meet our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of others. Examples include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nsending you communications containing information on how to complete your application;\nmonitoring and researching equal opportunities and admissions statistics; \ninviting you to take part in applicant surveys or enabling third parties to conduct applicant surveys on our behalf;\nnotifying you of changes to course information;\nsending specific communications to applicants likely to be affected by major incidents (e.g. natural disasters or conflicts in a specific country/region).\n\n6.4 Where we have your consent\nThere may be situations where we ask for your consent to process your data, for example the socio-economic questions in the application form (where a \"Prefer not to say\" option is available) and pre-application communications for student recruitment purposes (you will always be able to opt out of receiving such communications).\nIf you fail to provide personal information under 6.1 or 6.2 above\nIf you fail to provide certain information when requested under the circumstances described in 6.1 and 6.2 above, we may not be able to meet our contractual obligation to consider your application or to comply with our other legal obligations.\nChange of purpose\nWe will only process your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another related reason, and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use your data for an unrelated purpose, we will seek your consent to use it for that new purpose.\nPlease note that we may process your data without your knowledge or consent where this is required or permitted by law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        7. SPECIAL CATEGORY DATA AND CRIMINAL CONVICTION DATA      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial category data and criminal conviction data require a higher level of protection. Listed below are examples of processing activities that we regularly undertake in respect of these types of data.  In addition to the activities listed below, it may sometimes be necessary to process this sort of information for exceptional reasons, for example, because it is necessary to protect your vital interests or those of another person or for safeguarding purposes.  We may also process your special category data to identify your eligibility for certain scholarships (e.g., female only STEM scholarships).\n7.1 Health (including disability)\nWe will process data about your health where it is necessary to make reasonable adjustments for disability (e.g., to arrange access for interviews) and/or to monitor equal opportunities. This processing is necessary to meet our legal obligations.\n7.2 Criminal conduct\nData about relevant criminal convictions, including whether or not you have such a conviction, is gathered during the process of applying for a course with us once you have been offered a place. Data about barring decisions will only be collected if you have applied for and been accepted onto certain courses, and where we are legally required to do so. Processing of this nature is carried out in order to protect our legitimate interests including to protect members of the University community from a foreseeable risk of harm. For certain courses this processing is also necessary to meet our legal obligations.

(These circumstances are not mutually exclusive; we may use the same information under more than one heading.)\n6.1 Because we have a contractual obligation to consider your application\nInformation processed for this purpose includes the data listed in section 4 above.  \nWe also need to process data under this heading where the University is working with a third party in order to offer you services, for example, those offered by Colleges, sponsors (such as research councils), other universities or scholarship benefactors.

If we need to use your data for an unrelated purpose, we will seek your consent to use it for that new purpose.\nPlease note that we may process your data without your knowledge or consent where this is required or permitted by law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        7.

Data about barring decisions will only be collected if you have applied for and been accepted onto certain courses, and where we are legally required to do so. Processing of this nature is carried out in order to protect our legitimate interests including to protect members of the University community from a foreseeable risk of harm. For certain courses this processing is also necessary to meet our legal obligations. Such processing will be subject to suitable safeguards.\n7.3 Racial or ethnic origin, sexual orientation and religious belief\nData about your racial and ethnic origin, religious belief or sexual orientation will only be processed where you have volunteered it, including in order to identify your eligibility for certain scholarships in accordance with our legitimate interests, and/or where we need to process it in order to meet our statutory obligations under equality and/or other legislation.

(These circumstances are not mutually exclusive; we may use the same information under more than one heading.)\n6.1 Because we have a contractual obligation to consider your application\nInformation processed for this purpose includes the data listed in section 4 above.  \nWe also need to process data under this heading where the University is working with a third party in order to offer you services, for example, those offered by Colleges, sponsors (such as research councils), other universities or scholarship benefactors. See section 8 for a fuller list of examples of third party sharing.  \n6.2 Where we need to comply with a legal obligation\nInformation processed for this purpose includes, but is not limited to, information relating to the monitoring of equal opportunities and information provided to regulatory bodies including the General Medical Council, the Office for Students and the OIA.  We are also required by law to provide data to the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) which shares information with public authorities that are required to carry out their statutory and/or public functions.\n6.3 Where it is necessary to meet our legitimate interests\nWe also need to process your data in order to meet our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of others. Examples include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nsending you communications containing information on how to complete your application;\nmonitoring and researching equal opportunities and admissions statistics; \ninviting you to take part in applicant surveys or enabling third parties to conduct applicant surveys on our behalf;\nnotifying you of changes to course information;\nsending specific communications to applicants likely to be affected by major incidents (e.g. natural disasters or conflicts in a specific country/region).\n\n6.4 Where we have your consent\nThere may be situations where we ask for your consent to process your data, for example the socio-economic questions in the application form (where a \"Prefer not to say\" option is available) and pre-application communications for student recruitment purposes (you will always be able to opt out of receiving such communications).\nIf you fail to provide personal information under 6.1 or 6.2 above\nIf you fail to provide certain information when requested under the circumstances described in 6.1 and 6.2 above, we may not be able to meet our contractual obligation to consider your application or to comply with our other legal obligations.\nChange of purpose\nWe will only process your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another related reason, and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use your data for an unrelated purpose, we will seek your consent to use it for that new purpose.\nPlease note that we may process your data without your knowledge or consent where this is required or permitted by law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        7. SPECIAL CATEGORY DATA AND CRIMINAL CONVICTION DATA      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial category data and criminal conviction data require a higher level of protection. Listed below are examples of processing activities that we regularly undertake in respect of these types of data.  In addition to the activities listed below, it may sometimes be necessary to process this sort of information for exceptional reasons, for example, because it is necessary to protect your vital interests or those of another person or for safeguarding purposes.  We may also process your special category data to identify your eligibility for certain scholarships (e.g., female only STEM scholarships).\n7.1 Health (including disability)\nWe will process data about your health where it is necessary to make reasonable adjustments for disability (e.g., to arrange access for interviews) and/or to monitor equal opportunities. This processing is necessary to meet our legal obligations.\n7.2 Criminal conduct\nData about relevant criminal convictions, including whether or not you have such a conviction, is gathered during the process of applying for a course with us once you have been offered a place. Data about barring decisions will only be collected if you have applied for and been accepted onto certain courses, and where we are legally required to do so. Processing of this nature is carried out in order to protect our legitimate interests including to protect members of the University community from a foreseeable risk of harm. For certain courses this processing is also necessary to meet our legal obligations. Such processing will be subject to suitable safeguards.\n7.3 Racial or ethnic origin, sexual orientation and religious belief\nData about your racial and ethnic origin, religious belief or sexual orientation will only be processed where you have volunteered it, including in order to identify your eligibility for certain scholarships in accordance with our legitimate interests, and/or where we need to process it in order to meet our statutory obligations under equality and/or other legislation. This processing is considered to meet a substantial public interest, and will be subject to suitable safeguards.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        8. DATA SHARING WITH THIRD PARTIES      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to perform our contractual and other legal responsibilities or purposes, we may, need to share your information with the following types of organisation:\n\nColleges (including Private Permanent Halls (PPHs), in order to support your college placement (where applicable) and enhance your student experience;\nExternal organisations providing services to us, for example qualification verification services, and our enquiry management and plagiarism detection systems;  \nExternal organisations offering University-sponsored services including student surveys;\nThe governmental departments or agencies responsible for immigration and student loans;\nThird parties including your former employer(s) or educational establishment(s) to obtain a reference or to verify the accuracy of a reference or other information you have submitted with or in support of your application;\nIf you have or are seeking a particular relationship with a third party, for example, because of an exchange scheme;\nSponsors or benefactors of funding and financial support;\nOther Higher Education institutions as part of formal partnerships; \nThe Office for the Independent Adjudicator (OIA); \nWhere information is shared with third parties, we will seek to share the minimum amount necessary.\n\nAll third-party service providers that process data on our behalf are required to take appropriate security measures to protect your data in line with our policies.

TRANSFERS OF YOUR DATA OVERSEAS       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere may be occasions when we transfer your data overseas, for example, to obtain a reference or to verify information in your application.

HOW THE UNIVERSITY USES YOUR DATA      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore you submit your application, we process your data in order to administer our application process, such as to investigate a problem reported by you. Once you submit your application, we process your data for the purpose of processing and assessing your application for study, and for purposes related to your application, such as assessing your eligibility for funding and your financial status or to verify information you have supplied to us in your application (e.g., regarding previous qualifications).\nWe set out below those circumstances where it is necessary for us to process your data. (These circumstances are not mutually exclusive; we may use the same information under more than one heading.)\n6.1 Because we have a contractual obligation to consider your application\nInformation processed for this purpose includes the data listed in section 4 above.  \nWe also need to process data under this heading where the University is working with a third party in order to offer you services, for example, those offered by Colleges, sponsors (such as research councils), other universities or scholarship benefactors. See section 8 for a fuller list of examples of third party sharing.  \n6.2 Where we need to comply with a legal obligation\nInformation processed for this purpose includes, but is not limited to, information relating to the monitoring of equal opportunities and information provided to regulatory bodies including the General Medical Council, the Office for Students and the OIA.  We are also required by law to provide data to the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) which shares information with public authorities that are required to carry out their statutory and/or public functions.\n6.3 Where it is necessary to meet our legitimate interests\nWe also need to process your data in order to meet our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of others. Examples include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nsending you communications containing information on how to complete your application;\nmonitoring and researching equal opportunities and admissions statistics; \ninviting you to take part in applicant surveys or enabling third parties to conduct applicant surveys on our behalf;\nnotifying you of changes to course information;\nsending specific communications to applicants likely to be affected by major incidents (e.g. natural disasters or conflicts in a specific country/region).\n\n6.4 Where we have your consent\nThere may be situations where we ask for your consent to process your data, for example the socio-economic questions in the application form (where a \"Prefer not to say\" option is available) and pre-application communications for student recruitment purposes (you will always be able to opt out of receiving such communications).\nIf you fail to provide personal information under 6.1 or 6.2 above\nIf you fail to provide certain information when requested under the circumstances described in 6.1 and 6.2 above, we may not be able to meet our contractual obligation to consider your application or to comply with our other legal obligations.\nChange of purpose\nWe will only process your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another related reason, and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use your data for an unrelated purpose, we will seek your consent to use it for that new purpose.\nPlease note that we may process your data without your knowledge or consent where this is required or permitted by law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        7. SPECIAL CATEGORY DATA AND CRIMINAL CONVICTION DATA      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial category data and criminal conviction data require a higher level of protection. Listed below are examples of processing activities that we regularly undertake in respect of these types of data.  In addition to the activities listed below, it may sometimes be necessary to process this sort of information for exceptional reasons, for example, because it is necessary to protect your vital interests or those of another person or for safeguarding purposes.  We may also process your special category data to identify your eligibility for certain scholarships (e.g., female only STEM scholarships).\n7.1 Health (including disability)\nWe will process data about your health where it is necessary to make reasonable adjustments for disability (e.g., to arrange access for interviews) and/or to monitor equal opportunities. This processing is necessary to meet our legal obligations.\n7.2 Criminal conduct\nData about relevant criminal convictions, including whether or not you have such a conviction, is gathered during the process of applying for a course with us once you have been offered a place. Data about barring decisions will only be collected if you have applied for and been accepted onto certain courses, and where we are legally required to do so. Processing of this nature is carried out in order to protect our legitimate interests including to protect members of the University community from a foreseeable risk of harm. For certain courses this processing is also necessary to meet our legal obligations. Such processing will be subject to suitable safeguards.\n7.3 Racial or ethnic origin, sexual orientation and religious belief\nData about your racial and ethnic origin, religious belief or sexual orientation will only be processed where you have volunteered it, including in order to identify your eligibility for certain scholarships in accordance with our legitimate interests, and/or where we need to process it in order to meet our statutory obligations under equality and/or other legislation. This processing is considered to meet a substantial public interest, and will be subject to suitable safeguards.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        8. DATA SHARING WITH THIRD PARTIES      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to perform our contractual and other legal responsibilities or purposes, we may, need to share your information with the following types of organisation:\n\nColleges (including Private Permanent Halls (PPHs), in order to support your college placement (where applicable) and enhance your student experience;\nExternal organisations providing services to us, for example qualification verification services, and our enquiry management and plagiarism detection systems;  \nExternal organisations offering University-sponsored services including student surveys;\nThe governmental departments or agencies responsible for immigration and student loans;\nThird parties including your former employer(s) or educational establishment(s) to obtain a reference or to verify the accuracy of a reference or other information you have submitted with or in support of your application;\nIf you have or are seeking a particular relationship with a third party, for example, because of an exchange scheme;\nSponsors or benefactors of funding and financial support;\nOther Higher Education institutions as part of formal partnerships; \nThe Office for the Independent Adjudicator (OIA); \nWhere information is shared with third parties, we will seek to share the minimum amount necessary.\n\nAll third-party service providers that process data on our behalf are required to take appropriate security measures to protect your data in line with our policies.

We may also collect information about you which is in the public domain. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        6. HOW THE UNIVERSITY USES YOUR DATA      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore you submit your application, we process your data in order to administer our application process, such as to investigate a problem reported by you. Once you submit your application, we process your data for the purpose of processing and assessing your application for study, and for purposes related to your application, such as assessing your eligibility for funding and your financial status or to verify information you have supplied to us in your application (e.g., regarding previous qualifications).\nWe set out below those circumstances where it is necessary for us to process your data. (These circumstances are not mutually exclusive; we may use the same information under more than one heading.)\n6.1 Because we have a contractual obligation to consider your application\nInformation processed for this purpose includes the data listed in section 4 above.  \nWe also need to process data under this heading where the University is working with a third party in order to offer you services, for example, those offered by Colleges, sponsors (such as research councils), other universities or scholarship benefactors. See section 8 for a fuller list of examples of third party sharing.  \n6.2 Where we need to comply with a legal obligation\nInformation processed for this purpose includes, but is not limited to, information relating to the monitoring of equal opportunities and information provided to regulatory bodies including the General Medical Council, the Office for Students and the OIA.  We are also required by law to provide data to the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) which shares information with public authorities that are required to carry out their statutory and/or public functions.\n6.3 Where it is necessary to meet our legitimate interests\nWe also need to process your data in order to meet our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of others. Examples include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nsending you communications containing information on how to complete your application;\nmonitoring and researching equal opportunities and admissions statistics; \ninviting you to take part in applicant surveys or enabling third parties to conduct applicant surveys on our behalf;\nnotifying you of changes to course information;\nsending specific communications to applicants likely to be affected by major incidents (e.g. natural disasters or conflicts in a specific country/region).\n\n6.4 Where we have your consent\nThere may be situations where we ask for your consent to process your data, for example the socio-economic questions in the application form (where a \"Prefer not to say\" option is available) and pre-application communications for student recruitment purposes (you will always be able to opt out of receiving such communications).\nIf you fail to provide personal information under 6.1 or 6.2 above\nIf you fail to provide certain information when requested under the circumstances described in 6.1 and 6.2 above, we may not be able to meet our contractual obligation to consider your application or to comply with our other legal obligations.\nChange of purpose\nWe will only process your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another related reason, and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use your data for an unrelated purpose, we will seek your consent to use it for that new purpose.\nPlease note that we may process your data without your knowledge or consent where this is required or permitted by law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        7. SPECIAL CATEGORY DATA AND CRIMINAL CONVICTION DATA      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial category data and criminal conviction data require a higher level of protection. Listed below are examples of processing activities that we regularly undertake in respect of these types of data.  In addition to the activities listed below, it may sometimes be necessary to process this sort of information for exceptional reasons, for example, because it is necessary to protect your vital interests or those of another person or for safeguarding purposes.  We may also process your special category data to identify your eligibility for certain scholarships (e.g., female only STEM scholarships).\n7.1 Health (including disability)\nWe will process data about your health where it is necessary to make reasonable adjustments for disability (e.g., to arrange access for interviews) and/or to monitor equal opportunities. This processing is necessary to meet our legal obligations.\n7.2 Criminal conduct\nData about relevant criminal convictions, including whether or not you have such a conviction, is gathered during the process of applying for a course with us once you have been offered a place. Data about barring decisions will only be collected if you have applied for and been accepted onto certain courses, and where we are legally required to do so. Processing of this nature is carried out in order to protect our legitimate interests including to protect members of the University community from a foreseeable risk of harm. For certain courses this processing is also necessary to meet our legal obligations. Such processing will be subject to suitable safeguards.\n7.3 Racial or ethnic origin, sexual orientation and religious belief\nData about your racial and ethnic origin, religious belief or sexual orientation will only be processed where you have volunteered it, including in order to identify your eligibility for certain scholarships in accordance with our legitimate interests, and/or where we need to process it in order to meet our statutory obligations under equality and/or other legislation. This processing is considered to meet a substantial public interest, and will be subject to suitable safeguards.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        8. DATA SHARING WITH THIRD PARTIES      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to perform our contractual and other legal responsibilities or purposes, we may, need to share your information with the following types of organisation:\n\nColleges (including Private Permanent Halls (PPHs), in order to support your college placement (where applicable) and enhance your student experience;\nExternal organisations providing services to us, for example qualification verification services, and our enquiry management and plagiarism detection systems;  \nExternal organisations offering University-sponsored services including student surveys;\nThe governmental departments or agencies responsible for immigration and student loans;\nThird parties including your former employer(s) or educational establishment(s) to obtain a reference or to verify the accuracy of a reference or other information you have submitted with or in support of your application;\nIf you have or are seeking a particular relationship with a third party, for example, because of an exchange scheme;\nSponsors or benefactors of funding and financial support;\nOther Higher Education institutions as part of formal partnerships; \nThe Office for the Independent Adjudicator (OIA); \nWhere information is shared with third parties, we will seek to share the minimum amount necessary.\n\nAll third-party service providers that process data on our behalf are required to take appropriate security measures to protect your data in line with our policies. We do not allow them to use your data for their own purposes. We permit them to process your data only for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        9. TRANSFERS OF YOUR DATA OVERSEAS       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere may be occasions when we transfer your data overseas, for example, to obtain a reference or to verify information in your application.

WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT?\nExpand All\n\n\n\n\n\n        1. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT?      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe University of Oxford is committed to protecting the privacy and security of your personal information (‘personal data’).\nThis privacy policy describes how we collect and use your personal data during the application process, both before and after you submit your application, in accordance with the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) and related UK data protection legislation.\nThis policy applies to prospective postgraduate students. In addition, each college [1] will have its own privacy notice and the Student Privacy Policy will apply at the point when you accept any offer. It is important that you read this policy, together with any other privacy policy we may provide on specific occasions when we are collecting or processing information about you, so that you are aware of how and why we are using the information. We may update this policy at any time.\n[1] ‘College’ means any college or Permanent Private Hall. In the limited context of applications to study degrees accredited by the University of Oxford the term also covers Ripon College, Cuddesdon, and St Stephen's House, Oxford \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        2. GLOSSARY      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere we refer in this policy to your ‘personal data’, we mean any recorded information that is about you and from which you can be identified. It does not include data where your identity has been removed (anonymous data).\nWhere we refer to the ‘processing’ of your personal data, we mean anything that we do with that information, including collection, use, storage, disclosure, deletion or retention.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        3. WHO IS USING YOUR PERSONAL DATA?      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe University of Oxford[2] is the “data controller\" for the information that we obtain from you or others as a result of your application for graduate study. This means that we decide how to use it and are responsible for looking after it in accordance with the UK GDPR.\nAccess to your data will be provided to and shared between the academic and support staff, including those based in the University’s colleges[1], who need to view it as part of their work in carrying out the purposes set out in Section 6. We also share it with the third parties described in section 8.\n[2] The University’s legal title is the Chancellor, Masters and Scholars of the University of Oxford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        4. THE TYPES OF DATA WE HOLD ABOUT YOU      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe information we hold about you may include the following:\n\nPersonal details such as name, title, address, telephone number, email address, date of birth, legal sex and gender identity, ID photograph (included within received documents),  marital status, information about household income, and details of dependants;\nEducation and employment information (including the school(s), sixth form college(s) and other colleges or universities you have attended and places where you have worked, the courses you have completed, dates of study and examination results);\nOther personal background information collected during the admissions process, e.g. whether you have been in care, your socio-economic classification and details of your parents’ occupation and education;\nCorrespondence to or from the University, or a College, during the admissions process; \nInformation about your use of our IT systems;\nVisa, passport and immigration information;\nFunding and financial support information;\nYour feedback on the application process and university services collected through surveys such as (but not limited to) those sent to applicants and offer-holders; \nAttendance records at University organised recruitment events, and photographic data of such events captured for the purpose of live streaming and/or future publicity materials;\nInformation about your use of our information and communications systems, including your communication preferences and website interaction (cookies and similar technologies);\nInformation about your socio-economic background; and\nInformation we obtain from third parties relevant to verifying information supplied in your application (e.g. from referees or previous educational institutions). \n\nWe may also process the following \"special categories\" of more sensitive personal data:\n\nInformation about your race or ethnicity, sexual orientation and religious beliefs;\nInformation about your health, including any disability and/or medical condition;\nInformation about criminal convictions and offences, including proceedings or allegations .\n\nSpecial category data will only be used in accordance with section 7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        5. HOW THE UNIVERSITY OBTAINED YOUR DATA      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe collect the vast majority of the information directly from you, such as during your registration to use our online application form, through the application process and after you submit your application. We may also collect additional information from third parties and their staff, including referees, former schools, colleges and universities, and government departments and agencies. We may also collect information about you which is in the public domain. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        6. HOW THE UNIVERSITY USES YOUR DATA      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore you submit your application, we process your data in order to administer our application process, such as to investigate a problem reported by you. Once you submit your application, we process your data for the purpose of processing and assessing your application for study, and for purposes related to your application, such as assessing your eligibility for funding and your financial status or to verify information you have supplied to us in your application (e.g., regarding previous qualifications).\nWe set out below those circumstances where it is necessary for us to process your data. (These circumstances are not mutually exclusive; we may use the same information under more than one heading.)\n6.1 Because we have a contractual obligation to consider your application\nInformation processed for this purpose includes the data listed in section 4 above.  \nWe also need to process data under this heading where the University is working with a third party in order to offer you services, for example, those offered by Colleges, sponsors (such as research councils), other universities or scholarship benefactors. See section 8 for a fuller list of examples of third party sharing.  \n6.2 Where we need to comply with a legal obligation\nInformation processed for this purpose includes, but is not limited to, information relating to the monitoring of equal opportunities and information provided to regulatory bodies including the General Medical Council, the Office for Students and the OIA.  We are also required by law to provide data to the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) which shares information with public authorities that are required to carry out their statutory and/or public functions.\n6.3 Where it is necessary to meet our legitimate interests\nWe also need to process your data in order to meet our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of others. Examples include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nsending you communications containing information on how to complete your application;\nmonitoring and researching equal opportunities and admissions statistics; \ninviting you to take part in applicant surveys or enabling third parties to conduct applicant surveys on our behalf;\nnotifying you of changes to course information;\nsending specific communications to applicants likely to be affected by major incidents (e.g. natural disasters or conflicts in a specific country/region).\n\n6.4 Where we have your consent\nThere may be situations where we ask for your consent to process your data, for example the socio-economic questions in the application form (where a \"Prefer not to say\" option is available) and pre-application communications for student recruitment purposes (you will always be able to opt out of receiving such communications).\nIf you fail to provide personal information under 6.1 or 6.2 above\nIf you fail to provide certain information when requested under the circumstances described in 6.1 and 6.2 above, we may not be able to meet our contractual obligation to consider your application or to comply with our other legal obligations.\nChange of purpose\nWe will only process your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another related reason, and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use your data for an unrelated purpose, we will seek your consent to use it for that new purpose.\nPlease note that we may process your data without your knowledge or consent where this is required or permitted by law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        7. SPECIAL CATEGORY DATA AND CRIMINAL CONVICTION DATA      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial category data and criminal conviction data require a higher level of protection. Listed below are examples of processing activities that we regularly undertake in respect of these types of data.  In addition to the activities listed below, it may sometimes be necessary to process this sort of information for exceptional reasons, for example, because it is necessary to protect your vital interests or those of another person or for safeguarding purposes.  We may also process your special category data to identify your eligibility for certain scholarships (e.g., female only STEM scholarships).\n7.1 Health (including disability)\nWe will process data about your health where it is necessary to make reasonable adjustments for disability (e.g., to arrange access for interviews) and/or to monitor equal opportunities. This processing is necessary to meet our legal obligations.\n7.2 Criminal conduct\nData about relevant criminal convictions, including whether or not you have such a conviction, is gathered during the process of applying for a course with us once you have been offered a place. Data about barring decisions will only be collected if you have applied for and been accepted onto certain courses, and where we are legally required to do so. Processing of this nature is carried out in order to protect our legitimate interests including to protect members of the University community from a foreseeable risk of harm. For certain courses this processing is also necessary to meet our legal obligations. Such processing will be subject to suitable safeguards.\n7.3 Racial or ethnic origin, sexual orientation and religious belief\nData about your racial and ethnic origin, religious belief or sexual orientation will only be processed where you have volunteered it, including in order to identify your eligibility for certain scholarships in accordance with our legitimate interests, and/or where we need to process it in order to meet our statutory obligations under equality and/or other legislation. This processing is considered to meet a substantial public interest, and will be subject to suitable safeguards.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        8. DATA SHARING WITH THIRD PARTIES      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to perform our contractual and other legal responsibilities or purposes, we may, need to share your information with the following types of organisation:\n\nColleges (including Private Permanent Halls (PPHs), in order to support your college placement (where applicable) and enhance your student experience;\nExternal organisations providing services to us, for example qualification verification services, and our enquiry management and plagiarism detection systems;  \nExternal organisations offering University-sponsored services including student surveys;\nThe governmental departments or agencies responsible for immigration and student loans;\nThird parties including your former employer(s) or educational establishment(s) to obtain a reference or to verify the accuracy of a reference or other information you have submitted with or in support of your application;\nIf you have or are seeking a particular relationship with a third party, for example, because of an exchange scheme;\nSponsors or benefactors of funding and financial support;\nOther Higher Education institutions as part of formal partnerships; \nThe Office for the Independent Adjudicator (OIA); \nWhere information is shared with third parties, we will seek to share the minimum amount necessary.\n\nAll third-party service providers that process data on our behalf are required to take appropriate security measures to protect your data in line with our policies. We do not allow them to use your data for their own purposes. We permit them to process your data only for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        9. TRANSFERS OF YOUR DATA OVERSEAS       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere may be occasions when we transfer your data overseas, for example, to obtain a reference or to verify information in your application. Such transfers will only take place if one of the following applies:\n\nthe country receiving the data is considered by the UK to provide an adequate level of data protection, this includes countries in the European Economic Area;\nthe organisation receiving the data is covered by an arrangement recognised by the UK as providing an adequate standard of data protection;\nthe transfer has your consent;\nthe transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract with you or to take steps requested by you prior to entering into that contract; \nthe transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract with another person, which is in your interests;\nthe transfer is governed by approved contractual clauses; or\nthe transfer is necessary for important reasons of public interest. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        10.

It teaches the advanced techniques and ideas that are being developed in application domains (such as machine learning, verification and computer security) and the rich and diverse theories that underpin them. These include models of computation and data, and mathematical analysis of programs and algorithms.\nThe course aims:\nThe Department of Computer Science is committed to the development and application of effective theory based on realistic practice. The MSc in Advanced Computer Science is heavily informed by the department’s consultation and collaboration with industry, and some of the modules were developed through consultation and collaboration with industry. The department believes that only by the interplay of theory and practice can you be trained properly in such a rapidly advancing subject. Practice alerts us to real contemporary problems - theory is a shield against professional obsolescence.\nEntrants to the course will come from either a computer science or mathematical background. You may be a recent graduate in computer science and will supplement your knowledge with the kind of sound mathematical basis which is not always found in undergraduate courses. If you are a graduate in mathematics you will apply your training in the context of a rigorous application of the fundamental techniques of computer science.\nYou will develop knowledge and understanding of a formal disciplined approach to computer science, a range of relevant concepts, tools and techniques, the principles underpinning these techniques and the ability to apply them in novel situations. On subsequent employment, you will be able to select techniques most appropriate to your working environment, adapt and improve them as necessary, establish appropriate design standards for both hardware and software, train colleagues in the observance of sound practices, and keep abreast of research and development.\nThe academic year is split into three terms of eight weeks but work on the MSc course continues throughout the year and is not restricted just to term time. During the three terms of the course, you will choose from modules on various aspects of computer science. Most modules will last for one term and will be between 16 to 24 lectures. In addition, all modules will have associated classes and some may also have practical sessions (labs) associated with them.\nIn the third term (Trinity term) you will undertake a dissertation. Subject to meeting the relevant requirements (which may depend upon your module choices, dissertation subject and other academic factors), you may have the opportunity to transfer to a specialist stream of the course prior to completing your dissertation: either the MSc Advanced Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence) or the MSc Advanced Computer Science (Foundations of Computer Science).\nA typical week for a student taking three courses in each of the first two terms may be as follows:\nTotal - 35 hours\nThe split of work may differ depending on whether a course has practicals associated with it. This should be taken as a guide only. Examples of modules offered:\nThe options that are offered may vary from year to year as the course develops, and according to the interests of teaching staff. The above examples illustrate the kinds of topics that have been offered recently.\nThe course is full-time and requires attendance in Oxford. Full-time students are subject to the University's Residence requirements.\nAs a graduate student, you will have access to the University's wide range of world-class resources including libraries, museums, galleries, digital resources and IT services.\nThe Bodleian Libraries is the largest library system in the UK. It includes the main Bodleian Library and libraries across Oxford, including major research libraries and faculty, department and institute libraries. Together, the Libraries hold more than 13 million printed items, provide access to e-journals, and contain outstanding special collections including rare books and manuscripts, classical papyri, maps, music, art and printed ephemera.\nThe University's IT Services is available to all students to support with core university IT systems and tools, as well as many other services and facilities. IT Services also offers a range of IT learning courses for students, to support with learning and research.\nThe Department of Computer Science's teaching network comprises over 80 PCs located in the Department of Computer Science and the Practicals Laboratory of the Thom Building, the main building of the Department of Engineering Science. The machines in the Thom Building are mostly used for undergraduate practical sessions, though you may occasionally have a practical session scheduled here.Additionally there is a server-based remote access service available, such as personal laptop at home or through networked computers in college computer rooms.Linux is used throughout the teaching network.\nThe Department of Computer Science Library contains books, monographic series, journals, technical reports and past theses covering the main research interests of the department. It is principally for use by graduate students and staff. You will also be able to access other relevant libraries elsewhere in the University such as the Radcliffe Science Library, the Whitehead Library (at the Mathematical Institute for numerical analysts and formal mathematicians), and the Engineering Science Library (especially for those interested in robotics and machine vision).The Department of Computer Science houses lecture theatres and seminar rooms in which most of the University lectures in Computer Science take place.There are department kitchens on each floor and a central common room where you can meet informally. There is an active social committee organising events for staff, students and families.\nThe allocation of thesis supervision for the course is the responsibility of the Department of Computer Science and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under some circumstances it may be appropriate for a student's thesis work to be supervised by a faculty member outside the department of Computer Science.\nYou will be assigned an initial supervisor on arrival in Oxford whose role is to act as an academic advisor during the first two terms of the course. In the third term, a thesis supervisor will be agreed on.\nFor the taught modules, the mode of assessment shall be either written assignment or written examination, dependent on the module you are taking.\nA dissertation, completed independently under the guidance of an expert supervisor, on a topic of your choice and approved by the supervisor and MSc Course Director will be submitted by the end of the third term (Trinity Term).\nMany past students have progressed to PhD-level studies at leading universities; other have pursued careers in industry.\nThe University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page. However, there may be situations in which it is desirable or necessary for the University to make changes in course provision, either before or after registration. The safety of students, staff and visitors is paramount and major changes to delivery or services may have to be made if a pandemic, epidemic or local health emergency occurs. In addition, in certain circumstances, for example due to visa difficulties or because the health needs of students cannot be met, it may be necessary to make adjustments to course requirements for international study.\nWhere possible your academic supervisor will not change for the duration of your course. However, it may be necessary to assign a new academic supervisor during the course of study or before registration for reasons which might include illness, sabbatical leave, parental leave or change in employment.\nFor further information please see our page on changes to courses and the provisions of the student contract regarding changes to courses.\nThe requirements described below are specific to this course and apply only in the year of entry that is shown.

For the majority of Oxford scholarships, your application will automatically be assessed against the eligibility criteria, without needing to make a separate application. There are further Oxford scholarships available which have additional eligibility criteria and where you are required to submit a separate application. Most scholarships are awarded on the basis of academic merit and/or potential.\nTo ensure that you are considered for Oxford scholarships that require a separate application, for which you may be eligible, use our fees, funding and scholarship search tool to identify these opportunities and find out how to apply. Alongside Oxford scholarships, you should also consider other opportunities for which you may be eligible including a range of external funding, loan schemes for postgraduate study and any other scholarships which may also still be available after the January deadline as listed on our fees, funding and scholarship search tool.\nDetails of college-specific funding opportunities can also be found on individual college websites:\nSelect from the list:\nPlease refer to the College preference section of this page to identify which of the colleges listed above accept students for this course.\nFor the majority of college scholarships, it doesn’t matter which college, if any, you state a preference for in your application. If another college is able to offer you a scholarship, your application can be moved to that college if you accept the scholarship. Some college scholarships may require you to state a preference for that college when you apply, so check the eligibility requirements carefully.\nThe fees for this course are charged on an annual basis.\nCourse fees cover your teaching as well as other academic services and facilities provided to support your studies. Unless specified in the additional information section below, course fees do not cover your accommodation, residential costs or other living costs. They also don’t cover any additional costs and charges that are outlined in the additional information section below.\nCourse fees are payable each year, for the duration of your fee liability (your fee liability is the length of time for which you are required to pay course fees). For courses lasting longer than one year, please be aware that fees will usually increase annually. For details, please see our guidance on changes to fees and charges.\nThe Fees and Funding section of this website provides further information about course fees, including information about fee status and eligibility and your length of fee liability.\nThere are no compulsory elements of this course that entail additional costs beyond fees and living costs. However, as part of your course requirements, you may need to choose a dissertation, a project or a thesis topic. Please note that, depending on your choice of topic and the research required to complete it, you may incur additional expenses, such as travel expenses, research expenses, and field trips. You will need to meet these additional costs, although you may be able to apply for small grants from your department and/or college to help you cover some of these expenses.\nIn addition to your course fees and any additional course-specific costs, you will need to ensure that you have adequate funds to support your living costs for the duration of your course.\nFor the 2025-26 academic year, the range of likely living costs for a single, full-time student is between £1,425 and £2,035 for each month spent in Oxford. We provide the cost per month so you can multiply up by the number of months you expect to live in Oxford. Depending on your circumstances, you may also need to budget for the costs of a student visa and immigration health surcharge and/or living costs for family members or other dependants that you plan to bring with you to Oxford (assuming that dependant visa eligibility criteria are met).\nThe current economic climate and high national rate of inflation make it very hard to estimate potential changes to the cost of living over the next few years. For study in Oxford beyond the 2025-26 academic year, it is suggested that you budget for potential increases in living expenses of around 4% each year – although this rate may vary depending on the national economic situation. For further information, please consult our more detailed information about living costs, which includes a breakdown of likely living costs in Oxford for items such as food, accommodation and study costs.\nStudents enrolled on this course will belong to both a department/faculty and a college.

These include models of computation and data, and mathematical analysis of programs and algorithms.The course aims:to provide a challenging and supportive learning environment that encourages high quality students to reach their full potential, personally and academically;to provide the foundation for a professional career in computing-based industries;to enhance the skills of a professional who is already working in one of these industries;to provide a foundation for research into the theory and computing;to present knowledge, experience, reasoning methods and design and implementation techniques which are robust and forward-looking.The Department of Computer Science is committed to the development and application of effective theory based on realistic practice. The MSc in Advanced Computer Science is heavily informed by the department’s consultation and collaboration with industry, and some of the modules were developed through consultation and collaboration with industry. The department believes that only by the interplay of theory and practice can you be trained properly in such a rapidly advancing subject. Practice alerts us to real contemporary problems - theory is a shield against professional obsolescence.Entrants to the course will come from either a computer science or mathematical background. You may be a recent graduate in computer science and will supplement your knowledge with the kind of sound mathematical basis which is not always found in undergraduate courses. If you are a graduate in mathematics you will apply your training in the context of a rigorous application of the fundamental techniques of computer science.You will develop knowledge and understanding of a formal disciplined approach to computer science, a range of relevant concepts, tools and techniques, the principles underpinning these techniques and the ability to apply them in novel situations. On subsequent employment, you will be able to select techniques most appropriate to your working environment, adapt and improve them as necessary, establish appropriate design standards for both hardware and software, train colleagues in the observance of sound practices, and keep abreast of research and development.Course outlineThe academic year is split into three terms of eight weeks but work on the MSc course continues throughout the year and is not restricted just to term time. During the three terms of the course, you will choose from modules on various aspects of computer science. Most modules will last for one term and will be between 16 to 24 lectures. In addition, all modules will have associated classes and some may also have practical sessions (labs) associated with them. In the third term (Trinity term) you will undertake a dissertation. Subject to meeting the relevant requirements (which may depend upon your module choices, dissertation subject and other academic factors), you may have the opportunity to transfer to a specialist stream of the course prior to completing your dissertation: either the MSc Advanced Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence) or the MSc Advanced Computer Science (Foundations of Computer Science).A typical week for a student taking three courses in each of the first two terms may be as follows:Lectures - eight hoursTutorial classes - three hoursPracticals - four hoursSelf-directed study, including preparatory reading, problem sheets, revision of material - 20 hoursTotal - 35 hoursThe split of work may differ depending on whether a course has practicals associated with it. This should be taken as a guide only. Examples of modules offered:Advanced SecurityComputational BiologyComputational Learning TheoryFoundations of Self-Programming AgentsGeometric Deep LearningGraph Representation LearningProbabilistic Model CheckingDeep Learning in HealthcareQuantum Software The options that are offered may vary from year to year as the course develops, and according to the interests of teaching staff. The above examples illustrate the kinds of topics that have been offered recently.Attendance\n\nThe course is full-time and requires attendance in Oxford. Full-time students are subject to the University's Residence requirements.\n\nResources to support your study\n\nAs a graduate student, you will have access to the University's wide range of world-class resources including libraries, museums, galleries, digital resources and IT services.The Bodleian Libraries is the largest library system in the UK. It includes the main Bodleian Library and libraries across Oxford, including major research libraries and faculty, department and institute libraries. Together, the Libraries hold more than 13 million printed items, provide access to e-journals, and contain outstanding special collections including rare books and manuscripts, classical papyri, maps, music, art and printed ephemera.The University's IT Services is available to all students to support with core university IT systems and tools, as well as many other services and facilities. IT Services also offers a range of IT learning courses for students, to support with learning and research.\n\nThe Department of Computer Science's teaching network comprises over 80 PCs located in the Department of Computer Science and the Practicals Laboratory of the Thom Building, the main building of the Department of Engineering Science. The machines in the Thom Building are mostly used for undergraduate practical sessions, though you may occasionally have a practical session scheduled here.Additionally there is a server-based remote access service available, such as personal laptop at home or through networked computers in college computer rooms.Linux is used throughout the teaching network.The Department of Computer Science Library contains books, monographic series, journals, technical reports and past theses covering the main research interests of the department. It is principally for use by graduate students and staff. You will also be able to access other relevant libraries elsewhere in the University such as the Radcliffe Science Library, the Whitehead Library (at the Mathematical Institute for numerical analysts and formal mathematicians), and the Engineering Science Library (especially for those interested in robotics and machine vision).The Department of Computer Science houses lecture theatres and seminar rooms in which most of the University lectures in Computer Science take place.There are department kitchens on each floor and a central common room where you can meet informally. There is an active social committee organising events for staff, students and families.SupervisionThe allocation of thesis supervision for the course is the responsibility of the Department of Computer Science and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under some circumstances it may be appropriate for a student's thesis work to be supervised by a faculty member outside the department of Computer Science.You will be assigned an initial supervisor on arrival in Oxford whose role is to act as an academic advisor during the first two terms of the course. In the third term, a thesis supervisor will be agreed on.AssessmentFor the taught modules, the mode of assessment shall be either written assignment or written examination, dependent on the module you are taking.A dissertation, completed independently under the guidance of an expert supervisor, on a topic of your choice and approved by the supervisor and MSc Course Director will be submitted by the end of the third term (Trinity Term).Graduate destinationsMany past students have progressed to PhD-level studies at leading universities; other have pursued careers in industry. \n\nChanges to this course and your supervisionThe University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page. However, there may be situations in which it is desirable or necessary for the University to make changes in course provision, either before or after registration. The safety of students, staff and visitors is paramount and major changes to delivery or services may have to be made if a pandemic, epidemic or local health emergency occurs. In addition, in certain circumstances, for example due to visa difficulties or because the health needs of students cannot be met, it may be necessary to make adjustments to course requirements for international study.Where possible your academic supervisor will not change for the duration of your course. However, it may be necessary to assign a new academic supervisor during the course of study or before registration for reasons which might include illness, sabbatical leave, parental leave or change in employment.For further information please see our page on changes to courses and the provisions of the student contract regarding changes to courses.\n\n\nEntry requirements for entry in 2025-26\n\nProven and potential academic excellenceThe requirements described below are specific to this course and apply only in the year of entry that is shown.

If you are a graduate in mathematics you will apply your training in the context of a rigorous application of the fundamental techniques of computer science.You will develop knowledge and understanding of a formal disciplined approach to computer science, a range of relevant concepts, tools and techniques, the principles underpinning these techniques and the ability to apply them in novel situations. On subsequent employment, you will be able to select techniques most appropriate to your working environment, adapt and improve them as necessary, establish appropriate design standards for both hardware and software, train colleagues in the observance of sound practices, and keep abreast of research and development.Course outlineThe academic year is split into three terms of eight weeks but work on the MSc course continues throughout the year and is not restricted just to term time. During the three terms of the course, you will choose from modules on various aspects of computer science. Most modules will last for one term and will be between 16 to 24 lectures. In addition, all modules will have associated classes and some may also have practical sessions (labs) associated with them. In the third term (Trinity term) you will undertake a dissertation. Subject to meeting the relevant requirements (which may depend upon your module choices, dissertation subject and other academic factors), you may have the opportunity to transfer to a specialist stream of the course prior to completing your dissertation: either the MSc Advanced Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence) or the MSc Advanced Computer Science (Foundations of Computer Science).A typical week for a student taking three courses in each of the first two terms may be as follows:Lectures - eight hoursTutorial classes - three hoursPracticals - four hoursSelf-directed study, including preparatory reading, problem sheets, revision of material - 20 hoursTotal - 35 hoursThe split of work may differ depending on whether a course has practicals associated with it. This should be taken as a guide only.

It teaches the advanced techniques and ideas that are being developed in application domains (such as machine learning, verification and computer security) and the rich and diverse theories that underpin them. These include models of computation and data, and mathematical analysis of programs and algorithms.The course aims:to provide a challenging and supportive learning environment that encourages high quality students to reach their full potential, personally and academically;to provide the foundation for a professional career in computing-based industries;to enhance the skills of a professional who is already working in one of these industries;to provide a foundation for research into the theory and computing;to present knowledge, experience, reasoning methods and design and implementation techniques which are robust and forward-looking.The Department of Computer Science is committed to the development and application of effective theory based on realistic practice. The MSc in Advanced Computer Science is heavily informed by the department’s consultation and collaboration with industry, and some of the modules were developed through consultation and collaboration with industry. The department believes that only by the interplay of theory and practice can you be trained properly in such a rapidly advancing subject. Practice alerts us to real contemporary problems - theory is a shield against professional obsolescence.Entrants to the course will come from either a computer science or mathematical background. You may be a recent graduate in computer science and will supplement your knowledge with the kind of sound mathematical basis which is not always found in undergraduate courses. If you are a graduate in mathematics you will apply your training in the context of a rigorous application of the fundamental techniques of computer science.You will develop knowledge and understanding of a formal disciplined approach to computer science, a range of relevant concepts, tools and techniques, the principles underpinning these techniques and the ability to apply them in novel situations.

It teaches the advanced techniques and ideas that are being developed in application domains (such as machine learning, verification and computer security) and the rich and diverse theories that underpin them. These include models of computation and data, and mathematical analysis of programs and algorithms.The course aims:to provide a challenging and supportive learning environment that encourages high quality students to reach their full potential, personally and academically;to provide the foundation for a professional career in computing-based industries;to enhance the skills of a professional who is already working in one of these industries;to provide a foundation for research into the theory and computing;to present knowledge, experience, reasoning methods and design and implementation techniques which are robust and forward-looking.The Department of Computer Science is committed to the development and application of effective theory based on realistic practice. The MSc in Advanced Computer Science is heavily informed by the department’s consultation and collaboration with industry, and some of the modules were developed through consultation and collaboration with industry. The department believes that only by the interplay of theory and practice can you be trained properly in such a rapidly advancing subject. Practice alerts us to real contemporary problems - theory is a shield against professional obsolescence.Entrants to the course will come from either a computer science or mathematical background. You may be a recent graduate in computer science and will supplement your knowledge with the kind of sound mathematical basis which is not always found in undergraduate courses. If you are a graduate in mathematics you will apply your training in the context of a rigorous application of the fundamental techniques of computer science.You will develop knowledge and understanding of a formal disciplined approach to computer science, a range of relevant concepts, tools and techniques, the principles underpinning these techniques and the ability to apply them in novel situations. On subsequent employment, you will be able to select techniques most appropriate to your working environment, adapt and improve them as necessary, establish appropriate design standards for both hardware and software, train colleagues in the observance of sound practices, and keep abreast of research and development.Course outlineThe academic year is split into three terms of eight weeks but work on the MSc course continues throughout the year and is not restricted just to term time. During the three terms of the course, you will choose from modules on various aspects of computer science. Most modules will last for one term and will be between 16 to 24 lectures. In addition, all modules will have associated classes and some may also have practical sessions (labs) associated with them. In the third term (Trinity term) you will undertake a dissertation. Subject to meeting the relevant requirements (which may depend upon your module choices, dissertation subject and other academic factors), you may have the opportunity to transfer to a specialist stream of the course prior to completing your dissertation: either the MSc Advanced Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence) or the MSc Advanced Computer Science (Foundations of Computer Science).A typical week for a student taking three courses in each of the first two terms may be as follows:Lectures - eight hoursTutorial classes - three hoursPracticals - four hoursSelf-directed study, including preparatory reading, problem sheets, revision of material - 20 hoursTotal - 35 hoursThe split of work may differ depending on whether a course has practicals associated with it. This should be taken as a guide only. Examples of modules offered:Advanced SecurityComputational BiologyComputational Learning TheoryFoundations of Self-Programming AgentsGeometric Deep LearningGraph Representation LearningProbabilistic Model CheckingDeep Learning in HealthcareQuantum Software The options that are offered may vary from year to year as the course develops, and according to the interests of teaching staff. The above examples illustrate the kinds of topics that have been offered recently.Attendance\n\nThe course is full-time and requires attendance in Oxford. Full-time students are subject to the University's Residence requirements.\n\nResources to support your study\n\nAs a graduate student, you will have access to the University's wide range of world-class resources including libraries, museums, galleries, digital resources and IT services.The Bodleian Libraries is the largest library system in the UK. It includes the main Bodleian Library and libraries across Oxford, including major research libraries and faculty, department and institute libraries. Together, the Libraries hold more than 13 million printed items, provide access to e-journals, and contain outstanding special collections including rare books and manuscripts, classical papyri, maps, music, art and printed ephemera.The University's IT Services is available to all students to support with core university IT systems and tools, as well as many other services and facilities. IT Services also offers a range of IT learning courses for students, to support with learning and research.\n\nThe Department of Computer Science's teaching network comprises over 80 PCs located in the Department of Computer Science and the Practicals Laboratory of the Thom Building, the main building of the Department of Engineering Science. The machines in the Thom Building are mostly used for undergraduate practical sessions, though you may occasionally have a practical session scheduled here.Additionally there is a server-based remote access service available, such as personal laptop at home or through networked computers in college computer rooms.Linux is used throughout the teaching network.The Department of Computer Science Library contains books, monographic series, journals, technical reports and past theses covering the main research interests of the department. It is principally for use by graduate students and staff. You will also be able to access other relevant libraries elsewhere in the University such as the Radcliffe Science Library, the Whitehead Library (at the Mathematical Institute for numerical analysts and formal mathematicians), and the Engineering Science Library (especially for those interested in robotics and machine vision).The Department of Computer Science houses lecture theatres and seminar rooms in which most of the University lectures in Computer Science take place.There are department kitchens on each floor and a central common room where you can meet informally. There is an active social committee organising events for staff, students and families.SupervisionThe allocation of thesis supervision for the course is the responsibility of the Department of Computer Science and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under some circumstances it may be appropriate for a student's thesis work to be supervised by a faculty member outside the department of Computer Science.You will be assigned an initial supervisor on arrival in Oxford whose role is to act as an academic advisor during the first two terms of the course. In the third term, a thesis supervisor will be agreed on.AssessmentFor the taught modules, the mode of assessment shall be either written assignment or written examination, dependent on the module you are taking.A dissertation, completed independently under the guidance of an expert supervisor, on a topic of your choice and approved by the supervisor and MSc Course Director will be submitted by the end of the third term (Trinity Term).Graduate destinationsMany past students have progressed to PhD-level studies at leading universities; other have pursued careers in industry. \n\nChanges to this course and your supervisionThe University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

Unless specified in the additional information section below, course fees do not cover your accommodation, residential costs or other living costs. They also don’t cover any additional costs and charges that are outlined in the additional information section below.How long do I need to pay course fees?Course fees are payable each year, for the duration of your fee liability (your fee liability is the length of time for which you are required to pay course fees). For courses lasting longer than one year, please be aware that fees will usually increase annually. For details, please see our guidance on changes to fees and charges.\n\n\n\nWhere can I find further information about fees?The Fees and Funding section of this website provides further information about course fees, including information about fee status and eligibility and your length of fee liability.\n\n\n\nAdditional information\n\n\n\n\nThere are no compulsory elements of this course that entail additional costs beyond fees and living costs. However, as part of your course requirements, you may need to choose a dissertation, a project or a thesis topic. Please note that, depending on your choice of topic and the research required to complete it, you may incur additional expenses, such as travel expenses, research expenses, and field trips. You will need to meet these additional costs, although you may be able to apply for small grants from your department and/or college to help you cover some of these expenses.\n\n\n\nLiving costsIn addition to your course fees and any additional course-specific costs, you will need to ensure that you have adequate funds to support your living costs for the duration of your course.\n\n\n\nLiving costs for full-time studyFor the 2025-26 academic year, the range of likely living costs for a single, full-time student is between £1,425 and £2,035 for each month spent in Oxford. We provide the cost per month so you can multiply up by the number of months you expect to live in Oxford. Depending on your circumstances, you may also need to budget for the costs of a student visa and immigration health surcharge and/or living costs for family members or other dependants that you plan to bring with you to Oxford (assuming that dependant visa eligibility criteria are met).\n\n\n\nFurther information about living costsThe current economic climate and high national rate of inflation make it very hard to estimate potential changes to the cost of living over the next few years. For study in Oxford beyond the 2025-26 academic year, it is suggested that you budget for potential increases in living expenses of around 4% each year – although this rate may vary depending on the national economic situation.

Cairns / Oxford University Images)\n14 May 2025\nAboutEntry requirementsDepartmentFunding and CostsCollege preferenceHow to Apply\n\nAbout the courseThe MSc in Advanced Computer Science at Oxford has been designed to teach a range of advanced topics to graduates of computer science and other mathematical disciplines.\n\n\n\nAs in other branches of applied mathematics and engineering, improvements in the practice of computing necessitate a deep and broad engagement with the foundations of computer science.Recognising this, this full-time, twelve-month MSc has been designed to teach the mathematical principles of specification, design and efficient implementation of computing technologies.The MSc is designed to combine theory and practice. It teaches the advanced techniques and ideas that are being developed in application domains (such as machine learning, verification and computer security) and the rich and diverse theories that underpin them. These include models of computation and data, and mathematical analysis of programs and algorithms.The course aims:to provide a challenging and supportive learning environment that encourages high quality students to reach their full potential, personally and academically;to provide the foundation for a professional career in computing-based industries;to enhance the skills of a professional who is already working in one of these industries;to provide a foundation for research into the theory and computing;to present knowledge, experience, reasoning methods and design and implementation techniques which are robust and forward-looking.The Department of Computer Science is committed to the development and application of effective theory based on realistic practice. The MSc in Advanced Computer Science is heavily informed by the department’s consultation and collaboration with industry, and some of the modules were developed through consultation and collaboration with industry. The department believes that only by the interplay of theory and practice can you be trained properly in such a rapidly advancing subject. Practice alerts us to real contemporary problems - theory is a shield against professional obsolescence.Entrants to the course will come from either a computer science or mathematical background. You may be a recent graduate in computer science and will supplement your knowledge with the kind of sound mathematical basis which is not always found in undergraduate courses. If you are a graduate in mathematics you will apply your training in the context of a rigorous application of the fundamental techniques of computer science.You will develop knowledge and understanding of a formal disciplined approach to computer science, a range of relevant concepts, tools and techniques, the principles underpinning these techniques and the ability to apply them in novel situations. On subsequent employment, you will be able to select techniques most appropriate to your working environment, adapt and improve them as necessary, establish appropriate design standards for both hardware and software, train colleagues in the observance of sound practices, and keep abreast of research and development.Course outlineThe academic year is split into three terms of eight weeks but work on the MSc course continues throughout the year and is not restricted just to term time. During the three terms of the course, you will choose from modules on various aspects of computer science. Most modules will last for one term and will be between 16 to 24 lectures. In addition, all modules will have associated classes and some may also have practical sessions (labs) associated with them. In the third term (Trinity term) you will undertake a dissertation. Subject to meeting the relevant requirements (which may depend upon your module choices, dissertation subject and other academic factors), you may have the opportunity to transfer to a specialist stream of the course prior to completing your dissertation: either the MSc Advanced Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence) or the MSc Advanced Computer Science (Foundations of Computer Science).A typical week for a student taking three courses in each of the first two terms may be as follows:Lectures - eight hoursTutorial classes - three hoursPracticals - four hoursSelf-directed study, including preparatory reading, problem sheets, revision of material - 20 hoursTotal - 35 hoursThe split of work may differ depending on whether a course has practicals associated with it. This should be taken as a guide only.

It teaches the advanced techniques and ideas that are being developed in application domains (such as machine learning, verification and computer security) and the rich and diverse theories that underpin them. These include models of computation and data, and mathematical analysis of programs and algorithms.The course aims:to provide a challenging and supportive learning environment that encourages high quality students to reach their full potential, personally and academically;to provide the foundation for a professional career in computing-based industries;to enhance the skills of a professional who is already working in one of these industries;to provide a foundation for research into the theory and computing;to present knowledge, experience, reasoning methods and design and implementation techniques which are robust and forward-looking.The Department of Computer Science is committed to the development and application of effective theory based on realistic practice. The MSc in Advanced Computer Science is heavily informed by the department’s consultation and collaboration with industry, and some of the modules were developed through consultation and collaboration with industry. The department believes that only by the interplay of theory and practice can you be trained properly in such a rapidly advancing subject. Practice alerts us to real contemporary problems - theory is a shield against professional obsolescence.Entrants to the course will come from either a computer science or mathematical background. You may be a recent graduate in computer science and will supplement your knowledge with the kind of sound mathematical basis which is not always found in undergraduate courses. If you are a graduate in mathematics you will apply your training in the context of a rigorous application of the fundamental techniques of computer science.You will develop knowledge and understanding of a formal disciplined approach to computer science, a range of relevant concepts, tools and techniques, the principles underpinning these techniques and the ability to apply them in novel situations. On subsequent employment, you will be able to select techniques most appropriate to your working environment, adapt and improve them as necessary, establish appropriate design standards for both hardware and software, train colleagues in the observance of sound practices, and keep abreast of research and development.Course outlineThe academic year is split into three terms of eight weeks but work on the MSc course continues throughout the year and is not restricted just to term time. During the three terms of the course, you will choose from modules on various aspects of computer science. Most modules will last for one term and will be between 16 to 24 lectures. In addition, all modules will have associated classes and some may also have practical sessions (labs) associated with them. In the third term (Trinity term) you will undertake a dissertation. Subject to meeting the relevant requirements (which may depend upon your module choices, dissertation subject and other academic factors), you may have the opportunity to transfer to a specialist stream of the course prior to completing your dissertation: either the MSc Advanced Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence) or the MSc Advanced Computer Science (Foundations of Computer Science).A typical week for a student taking three courses in each of the first two terms may be as follows:Lectures - eight hoursTutorial classes - three hoursPracticals - four hoursSelf-directed study, including preparatory reading, problem sheets, revision of material - 20 hoursTotal - 35 hoursThe split of work may differ depending on whether a course has practicals associated with it. This should be taken as a guide only.

It teaches the advanced techniques and ideas that are being developed in application domains (such as machine learning, verification and computer security) and the rich and diverse theories that underpin them. These include models of computation and data, and mathematical analysis of programs and algorithms.The course aims:to provide a challenging and supportive learning environment that encourages high quality students to reach their full potential, personally and academically;to provide the foundation for a professional career in computing-based industries;to enhance the skills of a professional who is already working in one of these industries;to provide a foundation for research into the theory and computing;to present knowledge, experience, reasoning methods and design and implementation techniques which are robust and forward-looking.The Department of Computer Science is committed to the development and application of effective theory based on realistic practice. The MSc in Advanced Computer Science is heavily informed by the department’s consultation and collaboration with industry, and some of the modules were developed through consultation and collaboration with industry. The department believes that only by the interplay of theory and practice can you be trained properly in such a rapidly advancing subject. Practice alerts us to real contemporary problems - theory is a shield against professional obsolescence.Entrants to the course will come from either a computer science or mathematical background. You may be a recent graduate in computer science and will supplement your knowledge with the kind of sound mathematical basis which is not always found in undergraduate courses. If you are a graduate in mathematics you will apply your training in the context of a rigorous application of the fundamental techniques of computer science.You will develop knowledge and understanding of a formal disciplined approach to computer science, a range of relevant concepts, tools and techniques, the principles underpinning these techniques and the ability to apply them in novel situations. On subsequent employment, you will be able to select techniques most appropriate to your working environment, adapt and improve them as necessary, establish appropriate design standards for both hardware and software, train colleagues in the observance of sound practices, and keep abreast of research and development.Course outlineThe academic year is split into three terms of eight weeks but work on the MSc course continues throughout the year and is not restricted just to term time. During the three terms of the course, you will choose from modules on various aspects of computer science. Most modules will last for one term and will be between 16 to 24 lectures. In addition, all modules will have associated classes and some may also have practical sessions (labs) associated with them. In the third term (Trinity term) you will undertake a dissertation. Subject to meeting the relevant requirements (which may depend upon your module choices, dissertation subject and other academic factors), you may have the opportunity to transfer to a specialist stream of the course prior to completing your dissertation: either the MSc Advanced Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence) or the MSc Advanced Computer Science (Foundations of Computer Science).A typical week for a student taking three courses in each of the first two terms may be as follows:Lectures - eight hoursTutorial classes - three hoursPracticals - four hoursSelf-directed study, including preparatory reading, problem sheets, revision of material - 20 hoursTotal - 35 hoursThe split of work may differ depending on whether a course has practicals associated with it. This should be taken as a guide only. Examples of modules offered:Advanced SecurityComputational BiologyComputational Learning TheoryFoundations of Self-Programming AgentsGeometric Deep LearningGraph Representation LearningProbabilistic Model CheckingDeep Learning in HealthcareQuantum Software The options that are offered may vary from year to year as the course develops, and according to the interests of teaching staff. The above examples illustrate the kinds of topics that have been offered recently.Attendance\n\nThe course is full-time and requires attendance in Oxford. Full-time students are subject to the University's Residence requirements.\n\nResources to support your study\n\nAs a graduate student, you will have access to the University's wide range of world-class resources including libraries, museums, galleries, digital resources and IT services.The Bodleian Libraries is the largest library system in the UK.

However, as part of your course requirements, you may need to choose a dissertation, a project or a thesis topic. Please note that, depending on your choice of topic and the research required to complete it, you may incur additional expenses, such as travel expenses, research expenses, and field trips. You will need to meet these additional costs, although you may be able to apply for small grants from your department and/or college to help you cover some of these expenses.\n\n\n\nLiving costsIn addition to your course fees and any additional course-specific costs, you will need to ensure that you have adequate funds to support your living costs for the duration of your course.\n\n\n\nLiving costs for full-time studyFor the 2025-26 academic year, the range of likely living costs for a single, full-time student is between £1,425 and £2,035 for each month spent in Oxford. We provide the cost per month so you can multiply up by the number of months you expect to live in Oxford. Depending on your circumstances, you may also need to budget for the costs of a student visa and immigration health surcharge and/or living costs for family members or other dependants that you plan to bring with you to Oxford (assuming that dependant visa eligibility criteria are met).\n\n\n\nFurther information about living costsThe current economic climate and high national rate of inflation make it very hard to estimate potential changes to the cost of living over the next few years. For study in Oxford beyond the 2025-26 academic year, it is suggested that you budget for potential increases in living expenses of around 4% each year – although this rate may vary depending on the national economic situation.

It teaches the advanced techniques and ideas that are being developed in application domains (such as machine learning, verification and computer security) and the rich and diverse theories that underpin them. These include models of computation and data, and mathematical analysis of programs and algorithms.The course aims:to provide a challenging and supportive learning environment that encourages high quality students to reach their full potential, personally and academically;to provide the foundation for a professional career in computing-based industries;to enhance the skills of a professional who is already working in one of these industries;to provide a foundation for research into the theory and computing;to present knowledge, experience, reasoning methods and design and implementation techniques which are robust and forward-looking.The Department of Computer Science is committed to the development and application of effective theory based on realistic practice. The MSc in Advanced Computer Science is heavily informed by the department’s consultation and collaboration with industry, and some of the modules were developed through consultation and collaboration with industry. The department believes that only by the interplay of theory and practice can you be trained properly in such a rapidly advancing subject. Practice alerts us to real contemporary problems - theory is a shield against professional obsolescence.Entrants to the course will come from either a computer science or mathematical background. You may be a recent graduate in computer science and will supplement your knowledge with the kind of sound mathematical basis which is not always found in undergraduate courses. If you are a graduate in mathematics you will apply your training in the context of a rigorous application of the fundamental techniques of computer science.You will develop knowledge and understanding of a formal disciplined approach to computer science, a range of relevant concepts, tools and techniques, the principles underpinning these techniques and the ability to apply them in novel situations. On subsequent employment, you will be able to select techniques most appropriate to your working environment, adapt and improve them as necessary, establish appropriate design standards for both hardware and software, train colleagues in the observance of sound practices, and keep abreast of research and development.Course outlineThe academic year is split into three terms of eight weeks but work on the MSc course continues throughout the year and is not restricted just to term time. During the three terms of the course, you will choose from modules on various aspects of computer science. Most modules will last for one term and will be between 16 to 24 lectures. In addition, all modules will have associated classes and some may also have practical sessions (labs) associated with them. In the third term (Trinity term) you will undertake a dissertation. Subject to meeting the relevant requirements (which may depend upon your module choices, dissertation subject and other academic factors), you may have the opportunity to transfer to a specialist stream of the course prior to completing your dissertation: either the MSc Advanced Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence) or the MSc Advanced Computer Science (Foundations of Computer Science).A typical week for a student taking three courses in each of the first two terms may be as follows:Lectures - eight hoursTutorial classes - three hoursPracticals - four hoursSelf-directed study, including preparatory reading, problem sheets, revision of material - 20 hoursTotal - 35 hoursThe split of work may differ depending on whether a course has practicals associated with it. This should be taken as a guide only. Examples of modules offered:Advanced SecurityComputational BiologyComputational Learning TheoryFoundations of Self-Programming AgentsGeometric Deep LearningGraph Representation LearningProbabilistic Model CheckingDeep Learning in HealthcareQuantum Software The options that are offered may vary from year to year as the course develops, and according to the interests of teaching staff. The above examples illustrate the kinds of topics that have been offered recently.Attendance\n\nThe course is full-time and requires attendance in Oxford. Full-time students are subject to the University's Residence requirements.\n\nResources to support your study\n\nAs a graduate student, you will have access to the University's wide range of world-class resources including libraries, museums, galleries, digital resources and IT services.The Bodleian Libraries is the largest library system in the UK. It includes the main Bodleian Library and libraries across Oxford, including major research libraries and faculty, department and institute libraries. Together, the Libraries hold more than 13 million printed items, provide access to e-journals, and contain outstanding special collections including rare books and manuscripts, classical papyri, maps, music, art and printed ephemera.The University's IT Services is available to all students to support with core university IT systems and tools, as well as many other services and facilities. IT Services also offers a range of IT learning courses for students, to support with learning and research.\n\nThe Department of Computer Science's teaching network comprises over 80 PCs located in the Department of Computer Science and the Practicals Laboratory of the Thom Building, the main building of the Department of Engineering Science. The machines in the Thom Building are mostly used for undergraduate practical sessions, though you may occasionally have a practical session scheduled here.Additionally there is a server-based remote access service available, such as personal laptop at home or through networked computers in college computer rooms.Linux is used throughout the teaching network.The Department of Computer Science Library contains books, monographic series, journals, technical reports and past theses covering the main research interests of the department. It is principally for use by graduate students and staff. You will also be able to access other relevant libraries elsewhere in the University such as the Radcliffe Science Library, the Whitehead Library (at the Mathematical Institute for numerical analysts and formal mathematicians), and the Engineering Science Library (especially for those interested in robotics and machine vision).The Department of Computer Science houses lecture theatres and seminar rooms in which most of the University lectures in Computer Science take place.There are department kitchens on each floor and a central common room where you can meet informally. There is an active social committee organising events for staff, students and families.SupervisionThe allocation of thesis supervision for the course is the responsibility of the Department of Computer Science and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under some circumstances it may be appropriate for a student's thesis work to be supervised by a faculty member outside the department of Computer Science.You will be assigned an initial supervisor on arrival in Oxford whose role is to act as an academic advisor during the first two terms of the course. In the third term, a thesis supervisor will be agreed on.AssessmentFor the taught modules, the mode of assessment shall be either written assignment or written examination, dependent on the module you are taking.A dissertation, completed independently under the guidance of an expert supervisor, on a topic of your choice and approved by the supervisor and MSc Course Director will be submitted by the end of the third term (Trinity Term).Graduate destinationsMany past students have progressed to PhD-level studies at leading universities; other have pursued careers in industry. \n\nChanges to this course and your supervisionThe University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page. However, there may be situations in which it is desirable or necessary for the University to make changes in course provision, either before or after registration.

It teaches the advanced techniques and ideas that are being developed in application domains (such as machine learning, verification and computer security) and the rich and diverse theories that underpin them. These include models of computation and data, and mathematical analysis of programs and algorithms.The course aims:to provide a challenging and supportive learning environment that encourages high quality students to reach their full potential, personally and academically;to provide the foundation for a professional career in computing-based industries;to enhance the skills of a professional who is already working in one of these industries;to provide a foundation for research into the theory and computing;to present knowledge, experience, reasoning methods and design and implementation techniques which are robust and forward-looking.The Department of Computer Science is committed to the development and application of effective theory based on realistic practice. The MSc in Advanced Computer Science is heavily informed by the department’s consultation and collaboration with industry, and some of the modules were developed through consultation and collaboration with industry. The department believes that only by the interplay of theory and practice can you be trained properly in such a rapidly advancing subject. Practice alerts us to real contemporary problems - theory is a shield against professional obsolescence.Entrants to the course will come from either a computer science or mathematical background. You may be a recent graduate in computer science and will supplement your knowledge with the kind of sound mathematical basis which is not always found in undergraduate courses. If you are a graduate in mathematics you will apply your training in the context of a rigorous application of the fundamental techniques of computer science.You will develop knowledge and understanding of a formal disciplined approach to computer science, a range of relevant concepts, tools and techniques, the principles underpinning these techniques and the ability to apply them in novel situations. On subsequent employment, you will be able to select techniques most appropriate to your working environment, adapt and improve them as necessary, establish appropriate design standards for both hardware and software, train colleagues in the observance of sound practices, and keep abreast of research and development.Course outlineThe academic year is split into three terms of eight weeks but work on the MSc course continues throughout the year and is not restricted just to term time. During the three terms of the course, you will choose from modules on various aspects of computer science. Most modules will last for one term and will be between 16 to 24 lectures. In addition, all modules will have associated classes and some may also have practical sessions (labs) associated with them. In the third term (Trinity term) you will undertake a dissertation. Subject to meeting the relevant requirements (which may depend upon your module choices, dissertation subject and other academic factors), you may have the opportunity to transfer to a specialist stream of the course prior to completing your dissertation: either the MSc Advanced Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence) or the MSc Advanced Computer Science (Foundations of Computer Science).A typical week for a student taking three courses in each of the first two terms may be as follows:Lectures - eight hoursTutorial classes - three hoursPracticals - four hoursSelf-directed study, including preparatory reading, problem sheets, revision of material - 20 hoursTotal - 35 hoursThe split of work may differ depending on whether a course has practicals associated with it. This should be taken as a guide only. Examples of modules offered:Advanced SecurityComputational BiologyComputational Learning TheoryFoundations of Self-Programming AgentsGeometric Deep LearningGraph Representation LearningProbabilistic Model CheckingDeep Learning in HealthcareQuantum Software The options that are offered may vary from year to year as the course develops, and according to the interests of teaching staff. The above examples illustrate the kinds of topics that have been offered recently.Attendance\n\nThe course is full-time and requires attendance in Oxford. Full-time students are subject to the University's Residence requirements.\n\nResources to support your study\n\nAs a graduate student, you will have access to the University's wide range of world-class resources including libraries, museums, galleries, digital resources and IT services.The Bodleian Libraries is the largest library system in the UK. It includes the main Bodleian Library and libraries across Oxford, including major research libraries and faculty, department and institute libraries. Together, the Libraries hold more than 13 million printed items, provide access to e-journals, and contain outstanding special collections including rare books and manuscripts, classical papyri, maps, music, art and printed ephemera.The University's IT Services is available to all students to support with core university IT systems and tools, as well as many other services and facilities. IT Services also offers a range of IT learning courses for students, to support with learning and research.\n\nThe Department of Computer Science's teaching network comprises over 80 PCs located in the Department of Computer Science and the Practicals Laboratory of the Thom Building, the main building of the Department of Engineering Science. The machines in the Thom Building are mostly used for undergraduate practical sessions, though you may occasionally have a practical session scheduled here.Additionally there is a server-based remote access service available, such as personal laptop at home or through networked computers in college computer rooms.Linux is used throughout the teaching network.The Department of Computer Science Library contains books, monographic series, journals, technical reports and past theses covering the main research interests of the department. It is principally for use by graduate students and staff. You will also be able to access other relevant libraries elsewhere in the University such as the Radcliffe Science Library, the Whitehead Library (at the Mathematical Institute for numerical analysts and formal mathematicians), and the Engineering Science Library (especially for those interested in robotics and machine vision).The Department of Computer Science houses lecture theatres and seminar rooms in which most of the University lectures in Computer Science take place.There are department kitchens on each floor and a central common room where you can meet informally. There is an active social committee organising events for staff, students and families.SupervisionThe allocation of thesis supervision for the course is the responsibility of the Department of Computer Science and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under some circumstances it may be appropriate for a student's thesis work to be supervised by a faculty member outside the department of Computer Science.You will be assigned an initial supervisor on arrival in Oxford whose role is to act as an academic advisor during the first two terms of the course. In the third term, a thesis supervisor will be agreed on.AssessmentFor the taught modules, the mode of assessment shall be either written assignment or written examination, dependent on the module you are taking.A dissertation, completed independently under the guidance of an expert supervisor, on a topic of your choice and approved by the supervisor and MSc Course Director will be submitted by the end of the third term (Trinity Term).Graduate destinationsMany past students have progressed to PhD-level studies at leading universities; other have pursued careers in industry. \n\nChanges to this course and your supervisionThe University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page.

Unless specified in the additional information section below, course fees do not cover your accommodation, residential costs or other living costs. They also don’t cover any additional costs and charges that are outlined in the additional information section below.How long do I need to pay course fees?Course fees are payable each year, for the duration of your fee liability (your fee liability is the length of time for which you are required to pay course fees). For courses lasting longer than one year, please be aware that fees will usually increase annually. For details, please see our guidance on changes to fees and charges.\n\n\n\nWhere can I find further information about fees?The Fees and Funding section of this website provides further information about course fees, including information about fee status and eligibility and your length of fee liability.\n\n\n\nAdditional information\n\n\n\n\nThere are no compulsory elements of this course that entail additional costs beyond fees and living costs. However, as part of your course requirements, you may need to choose a dissertation, a project or a thesis topic. Please note that, depending on your choice of topic and the research required to complete it, you may incur additional expenses, such as travel expenses, research expenses, and field trips. You will need to meet these additional costs, although you may be able to apply for small grants from your department and/or college to help you cover some of these expenses.\n\n\n\nLiving costsIn addition to your course fees and any additional course-specific costs, you will need to ensure that you have adequate funds to support your living costs for the duration of your course.\n\n\n\nLiving costs for full-time studyFor the 2025-26 academic year, the range of likely living costs for a single, full-time student is between £1,425 and £2,035 for each month spent in Oxford. We provide the cost per month so you can multiply up by the number of months you expect to live in Oxford. Depending on your circumstances, you may also need to budget for the costs of a student visa and immigration health surcharge and/or living costs for family members or other dependants that you plan to bring with you to Oxford (assuming that dependant visa eligibility criteria are met).\n\n\n\nFurther information about living costsThe current economic climate and high national rate of inflation make it very hard to estimate potential changes to the cost of living over the next few years. For study in Oxford beyond the 2025-26 academic year, it is suggested that you budget for potential increases in living expenses of around 4% each year – although this rate may vary depending on the national economic situation. For further information, please consult our more detailed information about living costs, which includes a breakdown of likely living costs in Oxford for items such as food, accommodation and study costs.\nFundingFor entry in the 2025-26 academic year, the collegiate University expects to offer over 1,000 full or partial graduate scholarships across a wide range of graduate courses.If you apply by the January deadline shown on this page and receive a course offer, your application will then be considered for Oxford scholarships.

The first step in applying to graduate study at Oxford is to choose a course. You can find a course by using our A-Z of courses or by viewing a list of courses organised by their department and academic division.You can only apply to a maximum of three graduate courses in an admissions cycle (of which only two can be taught courses), so make sure you are happy with your choice before submitting an application, as you will not be able to withdraw it later and submit another application for a different course.Can I apply for graduate study if I'm currently studying?Yes. You can apply for graduate study at Oxford during the final year of your degree if you are planning to progress straight from your current degree to the course you are applying to without a break.Almost all of Oxford's graduate courses commence in Michaelmas term (early October). If you receive an offer of a place, you'll usually be required to fulfil any conditions set by your department and college by the end of August. This will include arranging for a final official transcript to be sent to your department directly from the institution or accredited e-transcript provider. Alternatively, the hard copy original transcript can be posted to the department. Further information about providing transcripts can be found within this Application Guide.If you're currently studying and won't receive your final degree results before the start of term in Oxford:contact your department to discuss whether you might be able start in a later term (research courses only); orwait and apply to begin your study in the next academic year (taught courses).Application deadlinesEach course page states the course's application deadline(s). Application deadlines vary between courses.If a course has more than one deadline, this means that applications are considered in two or more separate stages.You should try to apply by the earliest deadline stated on the course page, especially if:you need a student visa, as you must have your Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) number from the University before you can apply for your visa; oryou are declaring a disability or long-term health condition, as early notice will help us support you if your application is successful.Almost all courses have a December or January deadline. This is the latest deadline to be considered for the majority of Oxford scholarships. If your course also has a November deadline, applications submitted by this deadline will also be considered for Oxford scholarships and are also more likely to receive an earlier decision.If your course has a March or later deadline, applications submitted for this deadline are ineligible for consideration for centrally-managed scholarships.To ensure that you are considered for all Oxford scholarships for which you are eligible, you can search for Oxford scholarships that require a separate application. The search results will also include any Oxford scholarships that accept applications after the December or January deadline.You should aim to submit your application form and all of your supporting documents at least two weeks before your chosen deadline. Don't wait until the day of the deadline! We may not be able to answer your questions or help you to resolve any problems in time.You will usually receive a decision from the academic department about 8 to 10 weeks after the deadline you applied by.Courses staying open or reopening after the deadline(s)In some cases, a course may stay open to applications after the final deadline date has passed because there are still places available on the course.

From the academic year 2019/20, course fees for matriculated students are published as a single figure. This change is intended to ensure that the total level of fees payable is in all cases completely clear. Home PGCE students can access a tuition fee loan from the UK government to cover their course fee in full.\nThe course fees you pay include your fees for both University and college services and are divided between the University (including your department or faculty) and your college on a formula basis. More details are available from the Student Fees Team on request.\nFor graduate courses, course fees are payable each year for the duration of your fee liability, please see the fee liability section of this page for further details.\nFees will usually increase annually. For details, please see our guidance on likely increases to fees and charges.\n*For an explanation of the term ‘matriculated students’, see our Matriculation page.\nEU students applying for courses starting in 2025-26 should visit our fee status page for more information.\nThe Funding and costs section of each individual course page provides details of the course fees, including whether the amount shown is a fee for the entire course, an annual fee or a modular fee. Alternatively, you can use the Fees, funding and scholarship search to look for fees for your course as well as information about potential funding options that may be available to you.\nCourse fees are charged according to your fee status which will either be Home or Overseas.\nAll English universities use the same criteria to assess students' fee status which can be found on the UK Council for International Students' (UKCISA) website. If you are unsure about your fee status you should read this information first. The information provided by UKCISA is a summary of the government regulations for assessing fee status.\nBroadly speaking, your fee status depends on your nationality, your immigration status in the UK, where you have been living and what you have been doing for the three years prior to the start of your course.\nUniversities are required to assess each students' fee status independently which means that we cannot take into account decisions made by other Universities.\nOnce you have applied, the University can make an assessment of your fee status using the information you have provided on your application form. If we need further information in order to complete this assessment, and you are offered a place, we will contact you to request this.\nIt is not usually possible for your fee status to change once your course has started, except in certain specific circumstances. These circumstances include if you gain Settled status (such as Indefinite Leave to Remain) in the UK or if you or a relevant family member is recognised as a refugee or is granted humanitarian protection and you can meet the residency requirement. A change in fee status is not automatic and you should contact the Student Fees Team if you think you might be eligible.\nUnless the circumstances above apply to you, your fee status will not be reassessed for Year 4 of an integrated Master's qualification (for example, MMath) or for the clinical part of the BM BCh qualification as these are a continuation of your current course.\nIf you start a new course, then your fee status is re-assessed. If your circumstances have changed since you started your previous course, your fee status may be different.\nIf you are an EU national and do not live in the UK then you are likely to be charged Overseas fees. Students with settled and pre-settled status granted under the EU Settlement Scheme and some other categories of students who work in the UK can qualify for Home fee status as long as they meet the residence criteria. For more information about fee status criteria please visit the UKCISA website.\nIrish nationals who have been living in the Republic of Ireland or the UK can qualify for Home fees as long as they meet the residence requirements which can be found on the UKCISA website.\nUK nationals living in the EEA, Switzerland or Gibraltar from December 2020 until the first day of their course and for the three years before the first day of their course will also be charged Home fees subject to the requirements on the UKCISA website. Children of UK nationals will also be eligible on the same terms, even if they are not themselves UK nationals, as long as both they and their parent meet the above criteria.\nIf you have received an offer of a place, have read all the information here and on the UKCISA website, but are still not sure what fees you are likely to pay, or if you are a current student and would like a re-assessment of your status, please complete the fee questionnaire and contact the Student Fees Team for an assessment.\nPlease note that we do not normally carry out assessments if you have not yet received an offer of a place from the University.\nDetailed information for applicants regarding the regulations we use for assessing students' fee status can be found on the UKCISA website.\nPlease direct any questions about fee status to the Student Fees Team.\nYour length of fee liability is the length of time that you have to pay course fees to the University. Your normal period of fee liability will usually be the same as the standard length of your course.\nYou are required to pay your course fees for the year no later than Week 1 in the term in which you commence study or seven days after the actual start date of your course if this is later. We recommend you contact your college to check payment arrangements.\nCurrently some colleges apply a termly continuation charge once students have exceeded the standard period of course fees liability.\nThe University will apply a continuation charge for graduate students starting research study in 2011/12 or later (this includes any students progressing from a postgraduate taught degree to a research degree in 2011/12). The charge will apply to all students regardless of Home or Overseas fee status.\nFurther information about University and college continuation charges can be found on the Continuation charges page.\nFees may also be payable if you need to re-sit an examination, change your options after the deadline re-submit a thesis or dissertation, or need a transcript beyond the first copy.\nSome charges are made in addition to course fees, for example if you need to re-sit an examination, change your options after the deadline, or need to re-submit a thesis or dissertation, or need a transcript beyond the first copy. More details on these fees are available on the other charges page available from the right hand side of this page.\nYes, course fees are payable whether you are in Oxford or are conducting research elsewhere. Research programmes have a standard period of fee liability, more information on this is available below.\nMaximum liabilities quoted on this page are taken from detailed information contained in the University's Regulations on Financial Matters, which are the definitive source for information on course fees.\nStandard fee liability by programme of study:\nOnly a few departments have introduced such a deposit and the courses for which a deposit is charged are listed below.

From the academic year 2019/20, course fees for matriculated students are published as a single figure. This change is intended to ensure that the total level of fees payable is in all cases completely clear. Home PGCE students can access a tuition fee loan from the UK government to cover their course fee in full.The course fees you pay include your fees for both University and college services and are divided between the University (including your department or faculty) and your college on a formula basis. More details are available from the Student Fees Team on request.For graduate courses, course fees are payable each year for the duration of your fee liability, please see the fee liability section of this page for further details. Fees will usually increase annually. For details, please see our guidance on likely increases to fees and charges.*For an explanation of the term ‘matriculated students’, see our Matriculation page.Information for students from the EU, EEA and SwitzerlandEU students applying for courses starting in 2025-26 should visit our fee status page for more information. Where can I find details of course fees for each course?The Funding and costs section of each individual course page provides details of the course fees, including whether the amount shown is a fee for the entire course, an annual fee or a modular fee. Alternatively, you can use the Fees, funding and scholarship search to look for fees for your course as well as information about potential funding options that may be available to you.\nFee statusCourse fees are charged according to your fee status which will either be Home or Overseas.How is my fee status decided?All English universities use the same criteria to assess students' fee status which can be found on the UK Council for International Students' (UKCISA) website. If you are unsure about your fee status you should read this information first. The information provided by UKCISA is a summary of the government regulations for assessing fee status.Broadly speaking, your fee status depends on your nationality, your immigration status in the UK, where you have been living and what you have been doing for the three years prior to the start of your course.Universities are required to assess each students' fee status independently which means that we cannot take into account decisions made by other Universities. Once you have applied, the University can make an assessment of your fee status using the information you have provided on your application form. If we need further information in order to complete this assessment, and you are offered a place, we will contact you to request this. Can my fee status change?It is not usually possible for your fee status to change once your course has started, except in certain specific circumstances. These circumstances include if you gain Settled status (such as Indefinite Leave to Remain) in the UK or if you or a relevant family member is recognised as a refugee or is granted humanitarian protection and you can meet the residency requirement. A change in fee status is not automatic and you should contact the Student Fees Team if you think you might be eligible.Unless the circumstances above apply to you, your fee status will not be reassessed for Year 4 of an integrated Master's qualification (for example, MMath) or for the clinical part of the BM BCh qualification as these are a continuation of your current course.If you start a new course, then your fee status is re-assessed. If your circumstances have changed since you started your previous course, your fee status may be different.Information for applicants from the EU, EEA and SwitzerlandIf you are an EU national and do not live in the UK then you are likely to be charged Overseas fees. Students with settled and pre-settled status granted under the EU Settlement Scheme and some other categories of students who work in the UK can qualify for Home fee status as long as they meet the residence criteria. For more information about fee status criteria please visit the UKCISA website.Information for applicants from the Republic of IrelandIrish nationals who have been living in the Republic of Ireland or the UK can qualify for Home fees as long as they meet the residence requirements which can be found on the UKCISA website.UK nationals who have been living in the EEA, Switzerland or Gibraltar and are returning to England to studyUK nationals living in the EEA, Switzerland or Gibraltar from December 2020 until the first day of their course and for the three years before the first day of their course will also be charged Home fees subject to the requirements on the UKCISA website. Children of UK nationals will also be eligible on the same terms, even if they are not themselves UK nationals, as long as both they and their parent meet the above criteria.More informationIf you have received an offer of a place, have read all the information here and on the UKCISA website, but are still not sure what fees you are likely to pay, or if you are a current student and would like a re-assessment of your status, please complete the fee questionnaire and contact the Student Fees Team for an assessment.Please note that we do not normally carry out assessments if you have not yet received an offer of a place from the University.\nClassification of fee statusDetailed information for applicants regarding the regulations we use for assessing students' fee status can be found on the UKCISA website. Further InformationPlease direct any questions about fee status to the Student Fees Team.\nFee liabilityYour length of fee liability is the length of time that you have to pay course fees to the University. Your normal period of fee liability will usually be the same as the standard length of your course.Fee liability informationYou are required to pay your course fees for the year no later than Week 1 in the term in which you commence study or seven days after the actual start date of your course if this is later. We recommend you contact your college to check payment arrangements.What fees or charges are payable after I've reached the standard period of course fees liability?Currently some colleges apply a termly continuation charge once students have exceeded the standard period of course fees liability. The University will apply a continuation charge for graduate students starting research study in 2011/12 or later (this includes any students progressing from a postgraduate taught degree to a research degree in 2011/12). The charge will apply to all students regardless of Home or Overseas fee status.  Further information about University and college continuation charges can be found on the Continuation charges page.Fees may also be payable if you need to re-sit an examination, change your options after the deadline re-submit a thesis or dissertation, or need a transcript beyond the first copy. Does the University apply any fees or charges in addition to course fees?Some charges are made in addition to course fees, for example if you need to re-sit an examination, change your options after the deadline, or need to re-submit a thesis or dissertation, or need a transcript beyond the first copy. More details on these fees are available on the other charges page available from the right hand side of this page.I'm a research student and I'm conducting research outside Oxford, do I still have to pay course fees?Yes, course fees are payable whether you are in Oxford or are conducting research elsewhere.

From the academic year 2019/20, course fees for matriculated students are published as a single figure. This change is intended to ensure that the total level of fees payable is in all cases completely clear. Home PGCE students can access a tuition fee loan from the UK government to cover their course fee in full.The course fees you pay include your fees for both University and college services and are divided between the University (including your department or faculty) and your college on a formula basis. More details are available from the Student Fees Team on request.For graduate courses, course fees are payable each year for the duration of your fee liability, please see the fee liability section of this page for further details. Fees will usually increase annually. For details, please see our guidance on likely increases to fees and charges.*For an explanation of the term ‘matriculated students’, see our Matriculation page.Information for students from the EU, EEA and SwitzerlandEU students applying for courses starting in 2025-26 should visit our fee status page for more information. Where can I find details of course fees for each course?The Funding and costs section of each individual course page provides details of the course fees, including whether the amount shown is a fee for the entire course, an annual fee or a modular fee. Alternatively, you can use the Fees, funding and scholarship search to look for fees for your course as well as information about potential funding options that may be available to you.\nFee statusCourse fees are charged according to your fee status which will either be Home or Overseas.How is my fee status decided?All English universities use the same criteria to assess students' fee status which can be found on the UK Council for International Students' (UKCISA) website. If you are unsure about your fee status you should read this information first. The information provided by UKCISA is a summary of the government regulations for assessing fee status.Broadly speaking, your fee status depends on your nationality, your immigration status in the UK, where you have been living and what you have been doing for the three years prior to the start of your course.Universities are required to assess each students' fee status independently which means that we cannot take into account decisions made by other Universities. Once you have applied, the University can make an assessment of your fee status using the information you have provided on your application form. If we need further information in order to complete this assessment, and you are offered a place, we will contact you to request this. Can my fee status change?It is not usually possible for your fee status to change once your course has started, except in certain specific circumstances. These circumstances include if you gain Settled status (such as Indefinite Leave to Remain) in the UK or if you or a relevant family member is recognised as a refugee or is granted humanitarian protection and you can meet the residency requirement. A change in fee status is not automatic and you should contact the Student Fees Team if you think you might be eligible.Unless the circumstances above apply to you, your fee status will not be reassessed for Year 4 of an integrated Master's qualification (for example, MMath) or for the clinical part of the BM BCh qualification as these are a continuation of your current course.If you start a new course, then your fee status is re-assessed. If your circumstances have changed since you started your previous course, your fee status may be different.Information for applicants from the EU, EEA and SwitzerlandIf you are an EU national and do not live in the UK then you are likely to be charged Overseas fees. Students with settled and pre-settled status granted under the EU Settlement Scheme and some other categories of students who work in the UK can qualify for Home fee status as long as they meet the residence criteria. For more information about fee status criteria please visit the UKCISA website.Information for applicants from the Republic of IrelandIrish nationals who have been living in the Republic of Ireland or the UK can qualify for Home fees as long as they meet the residence requirements which can be found on the UKCISA website.UK nationals who have been living in the EEA, Switzerland or Gibraltar and are returning to England to studyUK nationals living in the EEA, Switzerland or Gibraltar from December 2020 until the first day of their course and for the three years before the first day of their course will also be charged Home fees subject to the requirements on the UKCISA website. Children of UK nationals will also be eligible on the same terms, even if they are not themselves UK nationals, as long as both they and their parent meet the above criteria.More informationIf you have received an offer of a place, have read all the information here and on the UKCISA website, but are still not sure what fees you are likely to pay, or if you are a current student and would like a re-assessment of your status, please complete the fee questionnaire and contact the Student Fees Team for an assessment.Please note that we do not normally carry out assessments if you have not yet received an offer of a place from the University.\nClassification of fee statusDetailed information for applicants regarding the regulations we use for assessing students' fee status can be found on the UKCISA website. Further InformationPlease direct any questions about fee status to the Student Fees Team.\nFee liabilityYour length of fee liability is the length of time that you have to pay course fees to the University.

We recommend you contact your college to check payment arrangements.What fees or charges are payable after I've reached the standard period of course fees liability?Currently some colleges apply a termly continuation charge once students have exceeded the standard period of course fees liability. The University will apply a continuation charge for graduate students starting research study in 2011/12 or later (this includes any students progressing from a postgraduate taught degree to a research degree in 2011/12). The charge will apply to all students regardless of Home or Overseas fee status.  Further information about University and college continuation charges can be found on the Continuation charges page.Fees may also be payable if you need to re-sit an examination, change your options after the deadline re-submit a thesis or dissertation, or need a transcript beyond the first copy. Does the University apply any fees or charges in addition to course fees?Some charges are made in addition to course fees, for example if you need to re-sit an examination, change your options after the deadline, or need to re-submit a thesis or dissertation, or need a transcript beyond the first copy.

If you withdraw during a term, you may be liable for fees for that term depending on the date of your withdrawal. If you withdraw before Monday of Week 4 of any term then you will not usually be liable for fees for that term. If you withdraw after Monday of Week 4 of any term, you will be liable for fees for that term. Different policies apply to certain courses delivered by Saïd Business School and the Department for Continuing Education and for courses with a modular structure. If you are thinking about withdrawing, you should talk to your college or your department to discuss your options.What if I suspend from my course, am I eligible for a refund?The same rules apply for suspension as for withdrawal.If you are considering suspending your studies you should talk to your college or your department to discuss your options.I'm a research student and I'm planning on submitting my thesis early, do I have to keep paying course fees?If you are a research student and are planning to submit your thesis before you reach your maximum fee liability, you only need to pay fees up to and including the term in which you submit your thesis.

Fees for courses with a modular structure are usually paid direct to the department. If you are a Home undergraduate and you have taken out a UK government tuition fee loan, this will be paid direct to the University. Your college may ask for evidence of the loan.When do I have to pay my fees?Course fees for the full academic year are payable no later than Week 1 in the term in which study commences. We recommend you contact your college to check payment arrangements.How should I pay my fees?As course fees are collected by colleges, you should visit your college's website for more information about acceptable methods of payment.Can I pay in instalments?Course fees are payable annually in advance.  In exceptional circumstances your college may allow you to pay by instalments. You should contact your college as soon as possible before the start of the academic year if you would like to investigate this.What if I withdraw from my course, am I eligible for a refund?If you withdraw from your course, you will generally be eligible for a refund of course fees for each complete term not started. If you withdraw during a term, you may be liable for fees for that term depending on the date of your withdrawal. If you withdraw before Monday of Week 4 of any term then you will not usually be liable for fees for that term. If you withdraw after Monday of Week 4 of any term, you will be liable for fees for that term. Different policies apply to certain courses delivered by Saïd Business School and the Department for Continuing Education and for courses with a modular structure. If you are thinking about withdrawing, you should talk to your college or your department to discuss your options.What if I suspend from my course, am I eligible for a refund?The same rules apply for suspension as for withdrawal.If you are considering suspending your studies you should talk to your college or your department to discuss your options.I'm a research student and I'm planning on submitting my thesis early, do I have to keep paying course fees?If you are a research student and are planning to submit your thesis before you reach your maximum fee liability, you only need to pay fees up to and including the term in which you submit your thesis. For example, if you submit your DPhil thesis in the 8th term since starting, you will pay 8 terms of fees but not fees for the 9th term. If your thesis is referred back to you then you may be liable for a re-submission charge. Please refer to the Other charges page for more information.I'm a research student and I'm conducting research outside Oxford, do I still have to pay course fees?Yes, course fees are payable whether you are in Oxford or are conducting research elsewhere. Research programmes have a standard period of fee liability, more information on this is available in the fee liability section of this page.I think I've been charged the wrong fee, what should I do?You should contact your college in the first instance. The college will contact the relevant University departments and your fee will be investigated. If you are not satisfied with the result of the investigation, you may petition the Fees Panel. For more information on how to petition the Fees Panel, please email the Student Fees Team. Requests for refunds will not normally be considered more than one year after the fee has been paid.What happens if I don't pay my fees?If you don't pay your course fees, at the University’s discretion you will be suspended from your course and from access to all University facilities. You will not be allowed to sit any examinations or submit any coursework. If you are having difficulty paying your fees, we recommend you talk to your college at the earliest opportunity.Where can I get more information?The rules regarding payment of fees and refunds are in the Examination Regulations, Regulations on Financial Matters, Section 1, Subsection 3. You can also discuss payments and refunds with your college.\nCourse feesThe course fees paid by matriculated students* are for the provision of tuition, supervision, academic services and facilities by the University (including your department or faculty) and the colleges, but do not include residential or other living costs.Up to and including the academic year 2018/19, separate figures have been published on the university website for university fees and for college fees: the total payable is the sum of these two figures. From the academic year 2019/20, course fees for matriculated students are published as a single figure. This change is intended to ensure that the total level of fees payable is in all cases completely clear. Home PGCE students can access a tuition fee loan from the UK government to cover their course fee in full.The course fees you pay include your fees for both University and college services and are divided between the University (including your department or faculty) and your college on a formula basis. More details are available from the Student Fees Team on request.For graduate courses, course fees are payable each year for the duration of your fee liability, please see the fee liability section of this page for further details. Fees will usually increase annually. For details, please see our guidance on likely increases to fees and charges.*For an explanation of the term ‘matriculated students’, see our Matriculation page.Information for students from the EU, EEA and SwitzerlandEU students applying for courses starting in 2025-26 should visit our fee status page for more information. Where can I find details of course fees for each course?The Funding and costs section of each individual course page provides details of the course fees, including whether the amount shown is a fee for the entire course, an annual fee or a modular fee. Alternatively, you can use the Fees, funding and scholarship search to look for fees for your course as well as information about potential funding options that may be available to you.\nFee statusCourse fees are charged according to your fee status which will either be Home or Overseas.How is my fee status decided?All English universities use the same criteria to assess students' fee status which can be found on the UK Council for International Students' (UKCISA) website. If you are unsure about your fee status you should read this information first. The information provided by UKCISA is a summary of the government regulations for assessing fee status.Broadly speaking, your fee status depends on your nationality, your immigration status in the UK, where you have been living and what you have been doing for the three years prior to the start of your course.Universities are required to assess each students' fee status independently which means that we cannot take into account decisions made by other Universities. Once you have applied, the University can make an assessment of your fee status using the information you have provided on your application form. If we need further information in order to complete this assessment, and you are offered a place, we will contact you to request this. Can my fee status change?It is not usually possible for your fee status to change once your course has started, except in certain specific circumstances. These circumstances include if you gain Settled status (such as Indefinite Leave to Remain) in the UK or if you or a relevant family member is recognised as a refugee or is granted humanitarian protection and you can meet the residency requirement. A change in fee status is not automatic and you should contact the Student Fees Team if you think you might be eligible.Unless the circumstances above apply to you, your fee status will not be reassessed for Year 4 of an integrated Master's qualification (for example, MMath) or for the clinical part of the BM BCh qualification as these are a continuation of your current course.If you start a new course, then your fee status is re-assessed. If your circumstances have changed since you started your previous course, your fee status may be different.Information for applicants from the EU, EEA and SwitzerlandIf you are an EU national and do not live in the UK then you are likely to be charged Overseas fees. Students with settled and pre-settled status granted under the EU Settlement Scheme and some other categories of students who work in the UK can qualify for Home fee status as long as they meet the residence criteria. For more information about fee status criteria please visit the UKCISA website.Information for applicants from the Republic of IrelandIrish nationals who have been living in the Republic of Ireland or the UK can qualify for Home fees as long as they meet the residence requirements which can be found on the UKCISA website.UK nationals who have been living in the EEA, Switzerland or Gibraltar and are returning to England to studyUK nationals living in the EEA, Switzerland or Gibraltar from December 2020 until the first day of their course and for the three years before the first day of their course will also be charged Home fees subject to the requirements on the UKCISA website. Children of UK nationals will also be eligible on the same terms, even if they are not themselves UK nationals, as long as both they and their parent meet the above criteria.More informationIf you have received an offer of a place, have read all the information here and on the UKCISA website, but are still not sure what fees you are likely to pay, or if you are a current student and would like a re-assessment of your status, please complete the fee questionnaire and contact the Student Fees Team for an assessment.Please note that we do not normally carry out assessments if you have not yet received an offer of a place from the University.\nClassification of fee statusDetailed information for applicants regarding the regulations we use for assessing students' fee status can be found on the UKCISA website. Further InformationPlease direct any questions about fee status to the Student Fees Team.\nFee liabilityYour length of fee liability is the length of time that you have to pay course fees to the University.

We recommend you contact your college to check payment arrangements.What fees or charges are payable after I've reached the standard period of course fees liability?Currently some colleges apply a termly continuation charge once students have exceeded the standard period of course fees liability. The University will apply a continuation charge for graduate students starting research study in 2011/12 or later (this includes any students progressing from a postgraduate taught degree to a research degree in 2011/12). The charge will apply to all students regardless of Home or Overseas fee status.  Further information about University and college continuation charges can be found on the Continuation charges page.Fees may also be payable if you need to re-sit an examination, change your options after the deadline re-submit a thesis or dissertation, or need a transcript beyond the first copy. Does the University apply any fees or charges in addition to course fees?Some charges are made in addition to course fees, for example if you need to re-sit an examination, change your options after the deadline, or need to re-submit a thesis or dissertation, or need a transcript beyond the first copy. More details on these fees are available on the other charges page available from the right hand side of this page.I'm a research student and I'm conducting research outside Oxford, do I still have to pay course fees?Yes, course fees are payable whether you are in Oxford or are conducting research elsewhere.

Alternatively, you can use the Fees, funding and scholarship search to look for fees for your course as well as information about potential funding options that may be available to you.\nFee statusCourse fees are charged according to your fee status which will either be Home or Overseas.How is my fee status decided?All English universities use the same criteria to assess students' fee status which can be found on the UK Council for International Students' (UKCISA) website. If you are unsure about your fee status you should read this information first. The information provided by UKCISA is a summary of the government regulations for assessing fee status.Broadly speaking, your fee status depends on your nationality, your immigration status in the UK, where you have been living and what you have been doing for the three years prior to the start of your course.Universities are required to assess each students' fee status independently which means that we cannot take into account decisions made by other Universities. Once you have applied, the University can make an assessment of your fee status using the information you have provided on your application form. If we need further information in order to complete this assessment, and you are offered a place, we will contact you to request this. Can my fee status change?It is not usually possible for your fee status to change once your course has started, except in certain specific circumstances. These circumstances include if you gain Settled status (such as Indefinite Leave to Remain) in the UK or if you or a relevant family member is recognised as a refugee or is granted humanitarian protection and you can meet the residency requirement. A change in fee status is not automatic and you should contact the Student Fees Team if you think you might be eligible.Unless the circumstances above apply to you, your fee status will not be reassessed for Year 4 of an integrated Master's qualification (for example, MMath) or for the clinical part of the BM BCh qualification as these are a continuation of your current course.If you start a new course, then your fee status is re-assessed. If your circumstances have changed since you started your previous course, your fee status may be different.Information for applicants from the EU, EEA and SwitzerlandIf you are an EU national and do not live in the UK then you are likely to be charged Overseas fees. Students with settled and pre-settled status granted under the EU Settlement Scheme and some other categories of students who work in the UK can qualify for Home fee status as long as they meet the residence criteria. For more information about fee status criteria please visit the UKCISA website.Information for applicants from the Republic of IrelandIrish nationals who have been living in the Republic of Ireland or the UK can qualify for Home fees as long as they meet the residence requirements which can be found on the UKCISA website.UK nationals who have been living in the EEA, Switzerland or Gibraltar and are returning to England to studyUK nationals living in the EEA, Switzerland or Gibraltar from December 2020 until the first day of their course and for the three years before the first day of their course will also be charged Home fees subject to the requirements on the UKCISA website. Children of UK nationals will also be eligible on the same terms, even if they are not themselves UK nationals, as long as both they and their parent meet the above criteria.More informationIf you have received an offer of a place, have read all the information here and on the UKCISA website, but are still not sure what fees you are likely to pay, or if you are a current student and would like a re-assessment of your status, please complete the fee questionnaire and contact the Student Fees Team for an assessment.Please note that we do not normally carry out assessments if you have not yet received an offer of a place from the University.\nClassification of fee statusDetailed information for applicants regarding the regulations we use for assessing students' fee status can be found on the UKCISA website. Further InformationPlease direct any questions about fee status to the Student Fees Team.\nFee liabilityYour length of fee liability is the length of time that you have to pay course fees to the University.

We recommend you contact your college to check payment arrangements.What fees or charges are payable after I've reached the standard period of course fees liability?Currently some colleges apply a termly continuation charge once students have exceeded the standard period of course fees liability. The University will apply a continuation charge for graduate students starting research study in 2011/12 or later (this includes any students progressing from a postgraduate taught degree to a research degree in 2011/12). The charge will apply to all students regardless of Home or Overseas fee status.  Further information about University and college continuation charges can be found on the Continuation charges page.Fees may also be payable if you need to re-sit an examination, change your options after the deadline re-submit a thesis or dissertation, or need a transcript beyond the first copy. Does the University apply any fees or charges in addition to course fees?Some charges are made in addition to course fees, for example if you need to re-sit an examination, change your options after the deadline, or need to re-submit a thesis or dissertation, or need a transcript beyond the first copy.

Fees for courses with a modular structure are usually paid direct to the department. If you are a Home undergraduate and you have taken out a UK government tuition fee loan, this will be paid direct to the University. Your college may ask for evidence of the loan.When do I have to pay my fees?Course fees for the full academic year are payable no later than Week 1 in the term in which study commences. We recommend you contact your college to check payment arrangements.How should I pay my fees?As course fees are collected by colleges, you should visit your college's website for more information about acceptable methods of payment.Can I pay in instalments?Course fees are payable annually in advance.  In exceptional circumstances your college may allow you to pay by instalments. You should contact your college as soon as possible before the start of the academic year if you would like to investigate this.What if I withdraw from my course, am I eligible for a refund?If you withdraw from your course, you will generally be eligible for a refund of course fees for each complete term not started. If you withdraw during a term, you may be liable for fees for that term depending on the date of your withdrawal. If you withdraw before Monday of Week 4 of any term then you will not usually be liable for fees for that term. If you withdraw after Monday of Week 4 of any term, you will be liable for fees for that term. Different policies apply to certain courses delivered by Saïd Business School and the Department for Continuing Education and for courses with a modular structure. If you are thinking about withdrawing, you should talk to your college or your department to discuss your options.What if I suspend from my course, am I eligible for a refund?The same rules apply for suspension as for withdrawal.If you are considering suspending your studies you should talk to your college or your department to discuss your options.I'm a research student and I'm planning on submitting my thesis early, do I have to keep paying course fees?If you are a research student and are planning to submit your thesis before you reach your maximum fee liability, you only need to pay fees up to and including the term in which you submit your thesis. For example, if you submit your DPhil thesis in the 8th term since starting, you will pay 8 terms of fees but not fees for the 9th term. If your thesis is referred back to you then you may be liable for a re-submission charge. Please refer to the Other charges page for more information.I'm a research student and I'm conducting research outside Oxford, do I still have to pay course fees?Yes, course fees are payable whether you are in Oxford or are conducting research elsewhere. Research programmes have a standard period of fee liability, more information on this is available in the fee liability section of this page.I think I've been charged the wrong fee, what should I do?You should contact your college in the first instance. The college will contact the relevant University departments and your fee will be investigated. If you are not satisfied with the result of the investigation, you may petition the Fees Panel. For more information on how to petition the Fees Panel, please email the Student Fees Team. Requests for refunds will not normally be considered more than one year after the fee has been paid.What happens if I don't pay my fees?If you don't pay your course fees, at the University’s discretion you will be suspended from your course and from access to all University facilities. You will not be allowed to sit any examinations or submit any coursework. If you are having difficulty paying your fees, we recommend you talk to your college at the earliest opportunity.Where can I get more information?The rules regarding payment of fees and refunds are in the Examination Regulations, Regulations on Financial Matters, Section 1, Subsection 3. You can also discuss payments and refunds with your college.\nFeesThis page sets out information about course fees and other costs that will apply to your course.\nCourse feesThe course fees paid by matriculated students* are for the provision of tuition, supervision, academic services and facilities by the University (including your department or faculty) and the colleges, but do not include residential or other living costs.Up to and including the academic year 2018/19, separate figures have been published on the university website for university fees and for college fees: the total payable is the sum of these two figures. From the academic year 2019/20, course fees for matriculated students are published as a single figure. This change is intended to ensure that the total level of fees payable is in all cases completely clear. Home PGCE students can access a tuition fee loan from the UK government to cover their course fee in full.The course fees you pay include your fees for both University and college services and are divided between the University (including your department or faculty) and your college on a formula basis.

If you withdraw during a term, you may be liable for fees for that term depending on the date of your withdrawal. If you withdraw before Monday of Week 4 of any term then you will not usually be liable for fees for that term. If you withdraw after Monday of Week 4 of any term, you will be liable for fees for that term. Different policies apply to certain courses delivered by Saïd Business School and the Department for Continuing Education and for courses with a modular structure. If you are thinking about withdrawing, you should talk to your college or your department to discuss your options.What if I suspend from my course, am I eligible for a refund?The same rules apply for suspension as for withdrawal.If you are considering suspending your studies you should talk to your college or your department to discuss your options.I'm a research student and I'm planning on submitting my thesis early, do I have to keep paying course fees?If you are a research student and are planning to submit your thesis before you reach your maximum fee liability, you only need to pay fees up to and including the term in which you submit your thesis. For example, if you submit your DPhil thesis in the 8th term since starting, you will pay 8 terms of fees but not fees for the 9th term. If your thesis is referred back to you then you may be liable for a re-submission charge. Please refer to the Other charges page for more information.I'm a research student and I'm conducting research outside Oxford, do I still have to pay course fees?Yes, course fees are payable whether you are in Oxford or are conducting research elsewhere. Research programmes have a standard period of fee liability, more information on this is available in the fee liability section of this page.I think I've been charged the wrong fee, what should I do?You should contact your college in the first instance. The college will contact the relevant University departments and your fee will be investigated. If you are not satisfied with the result of the investigation, you may petition the Fees Panel. For more information on how to petition the Fees Panel, please email the Student Fees Team. Requests for refunds will not normally be considered more than one year after the fee has been paid.What happens if I don't pay my fees?If you don't pay your course fees, at the University’s discretion you will be suspended from your course and from access to all University facilities. You will not be allowed to sit any examinations or submit any coursework.

You can also discuss payments and refunds with your college.\nCourse feesThe course fees paid by matriculated students* are for the provision of tuition, supervision, academic services and facilities by the University (including your department or faculty) and the colleges, but do not include residential or other living costs.Up to and including the academic year 2018/19, separate figures have been published on the university website for university fees and for college fees: the total payable is the sum of these two figures. From the academic year 2019/20, course fees for matriculated students are published as a single figure. This change is intended to ensure that the total level of fees payable is in all cases completely clear. Home PGCE students can access a tuition fee loan from the UK government to cover their course fee in full.The course fees you pay include your fees for both University and college services and are divided between the University (including your department or faculty) and your college on a formula basis. More details are available from the Student Fees Team on request.For graduate courses, course fees are payable each year for the duration of your fee liability, please see the fee liability section of this page for further details. Fees will usually increase annually. For details, please see our guidance on likely increases to fees and charges.*For an explanation of the term ‘matriculated students’, see our Matriculation page.Information for students from the EU, EEA and SwitzerlandEU students applying for courses starting in 2025-26 should visit our fee status page for more information. Where can I find details of course fees for each course?The Funding and costs section of each individual course page provides details of the course fees, including whether the amount shown is a fee for the entire course, an annual fee or a modular fee. Alternatively, you can use the Fees, funding and scholarship search to look for fees for your course as well as information about potential funding options that may be available to you.\nFee statusCourse fees are charged according to your fee status which will either be Home or Overseas.How is my fee status decided?All English universities use the same criteria to assess students' fee status which can be found on the UK Council for International Students' (UKCISA) website. If you are unsure about your fee status you should read this information first. The information provided by UKCISA is a summary of the government regulations for assessing fee status.Broadly speaking, your fee status depends on your nationality, your immigration status in the UK, where you have been living and what you have been doing for the three years prior to the start of your course.Universities are required to assess each students' fee status independently which means that we cannot take into account decisions made by other Universities. Once you have applied, the University can make an assessment of your fee status using the information you have provided on your application form. If we need further information in order to complete this assessment, and you are offered a place, we will contact you to request this. Can my fee status change?It is not usually possible for your fee status to change once your course has started, except in certain specific circumstances. These circumstances include if you gain Settled status (such as Indefinite Leave to Remain) in the UK or if you or a relevant family member is recognised as a refugee or is granted humanitarian protection and you can meet the residency requirement. A change in fee status is not automatic and you should contact the Student Fees Team if you think you might be eligible.Unless the circumstances above apply to you, your fee status will not be reassessed for Year 4 of an integrated Master's qualification (for example, MMath) or for the clinical part of the BM BCh qualification as these are a continuation of your current course.If you start a new course, then your fee status is re-assessed. If your circumstances have changed since you started your previous course, your fee status may be different.Information for applicants from the EU, EEA and SwitzerlandIf you are an EU national and do not live in the UK then you are likely to be charged Overseas fees. Students with settled and pre-settled status granted under the EU Settlement Scheme and some other categories of students who work in the UK can qualify for Home fee status as long as they meet the residence criteria. For more information about fee status criteria please visit the UKCISA website.Information for applicants from the Republic of IrelandIrish nationals who have been living in the Republic of Ireland or the UK can qualify for Home fees as long as they meet the residence requirements which can be found on the UKCISA website.UK nationals who have been living in the EEA, Switzerland or Gibraltar and are returning to England to studyUK nationals living in the EEA, Switzerland or Gibraltar from December 2020 until the first day of their course and for the three years before the first day of their course will also be charged Home fees subject to the requirements on the UKCISA website. Children of UK nationals will also be eligible on the same terms, even if they are not themselves UK nationals, as long as both they and their parent meet the above criteria.More informationIf you have received an offer of a place, have read all the information here and on the UKCISA website, but are still not sure what fees you are likely to pay, or if you are a current student and would like a re-assessment of your status, please complete the fee questionnaire and contact the Student Fees Team for an assessment.Please note that we do not normally carry out assessments if you have not yet received an offer of a place from the University.\nClassification of fee statusDetailed information for applicants regarding the regulations we use for assessing students' fee status can be found on the UKCISA website. Further InformationPlease direct any questions about fee status to the Student Fees Team.\nFee liabilityYour length of fee liability is the length of time that you have to pay course fees to the University.

We recommend you contact your college to check payment arrangements.What fees or charges are payable after I've reached the standard period of course fees liability?Currently some colleges apply a termly continuation charge once students have exceeded the standard period of course fees liability. The University will apply a continuation charge for graduate students starting research study in 2011/12 or later (this includes any students progressing from a postgraduate taught degree to a research degree in 2011/12). The charge will apply to all students regardless of Home or Overseas fee status.  Further information about University and college continuation charges can be found on the Continuation charges page.Fees may also be payable if you need to re-sit an examination, change your options after the deadline re-submit a thesis or dissertation, or need a transcript beyond the first copy. Does the University apply any fees or charges in addition to course fees?Some charges are made in addition to course fees, for example if you need to re-sit an examination, change your options after the deadline, or need to re-submit a thesis or dissertation, or need a transcript beyond the first copy.

The information provided by UKCISA is a summary of the government regulations for assessing fee status.Broadly speaking, your fee status depends on your nationality, your immigration status in the UK, where you have been living and what you have been doing for the three years prior to the start of your course.Universities are required to assess each students' fee status independently which means that we cannot take into account decisions made by other Universities. Once you have applied, the University can make an assessment of your fee status using the information you have provided on your application form. If we need further information in order to complete this assessment, and you are offered a place, we will contact you to request this. Can my fee status change?It is not usually possible for your fee status to change once your course has started, except in certain specific circumstances. These circumstances include if you gain Settled status (such as Indefinite Leave to Remain) in the UK or if you or a relevant family member is recognised as a refugee or is granted humanitarian protection and you can meet the residency requirement. A change in fee status is not automatic and you should contact the Student Fees Team if you think you might be eligible.Unless the circumstances above apply to you, your fee status will not be reassessed for Year 4 of an integrated Master's qualification (for example, MMath) or for the clinical part of the BM BCh qualification as these are a continuation of your current course.If you start a new course, then your fee status is re-assessed. If your circumstances have changed since you started your previous course, your fee status may be different.Information for applicants from the EU, EEA and SwitzerlandIf you are an EU national and do not live in the UK then you are likely to be charged Overseas fees. Students with settled and pre-settled status granted under the EU Settlement Scheme and some other categories of students who work in the UK can qualify for Home fee status as long as they meet the residence criteria. For more information about fee status criteria please visit the UKCISA website.Information for applicants from the Republic of IrelandIrish nationals who have been living in the Republic of Ireland or the UK can qualify for Home fees as long as they meet the residence requirements which can be found on the UKCISA website.UK nationals who have been living in the EEA, Switzerland or Gibraltar and are returning to England to studyUK nationals living in the EEA, Switzerland or Gibraltar from December 2020 until the first day of their course and for the three years before the first day of their course will also be charged Home fees subject to the requirements on the UKCISA website. Children of UK nationals will also be eligible on the same terms, even if they are not themselves UK nationals, as long as both they and their parent meet the above criteria.More informationIf you have received an offer of a place, have read all the information here and on the UKCISA website, but are still not sure what fees you are likely to pay, or if you are a current student and would like a re-assessment of your status, please complete the fee questionnaire and contact the Student Fees Team for an assessment.Please note that we do not normally carry out assessments if you have not yet received an offer of a place from the University.\nClassification of fee statusDetailed information for applicants regarding the regulations we use for assessing students' fee status can be found on the UKCISA website. Further InformationPlease direct any questions about fee status to the Student Fees Team.\nFee liabilityYour length of fee liability is the length of time that you have to pay course fees to the University. Your normal period of fee liability will usually be the same as the standard length of your course.Fee liability informationYou are required to pay your course fees for the year no later than Week 1 in the term in which you commence study or seven days after the actual start date of your course if this is later. We recommend you contact your college to check payment arrangements.What fees or charges are payable after I've reached the standard period of course fees liability?Currently some colleges apply a termly continuation charge once students have exceeded the standard period of course fees liability. The University will apply a continuation charge for graduate students starting research study in 2011/12 or later (this includes any students progressing from a postgraduate taught degree to a research degree in 2011/12). The charge will apply to all students regardless of Home or Overseas fee status.  Further information about University and college continuation charges can be found on the Continuation charges page.Fees may also be payable if you need to re-sit an examination, change your options after the deadline re-submit a thesis or dissertation, or need a transcript beyond the first copy. Does the University apply any fees or charges in addition to course fees?Some charges are made in addition to course fees, for example if you need to re-sit an examination, change your options after the deadline, or need to re-submit a thesis or dissertation, or need a transcript beyond the first copy. More details on these fees are available on the other charges page available from the right hand side of this page.I'm a research student and I'm conducting research outside Oxford, do I still have to pay course fees?Yes, course fees are payable whether you are in Oxford or are conducting research elsewhere.

You should visit your college's website to check payment arrangements.Frequently asked questionsWho do I pay fees to?Course fees are payable to your college (check payment arrangements as these can differ from college to college) except for a small number of courses delivered by Saïd Business School and the Department for Continuing Education which collect fees direct. Fees for courses with a modular structure are usually paid direct to the department. If you are a Home undergraduate and you have taken out a UK government tuition fee loan, this will be paid direct to the University. Your college may ask for evidence of the loan.When do I have to pay my fees?Course fees for the full academic year are payable no later than Week 1 in the term in which study commences. We recommend you contact your college to check payment arrangements.How should I pay my fees?As course fees are collected by colleges, you should visit your college's website for more information about acceptable methods of payment.Can I pay in instalments?Course fees are payable annually in advance.  In exceptional circumstances your college may allow you to pay by instalments. You should contact your college as soon as possible before the start of the academic year if you would like to investigate this.What if I withdraw from my course, am I eligible for a refund?If you withdraw from your course, you will generally be eligible for a refund of course fees for each complete term not started. If you withdraw during a term, you may be liable for fees for that term depending on the date of your withdrawal. If you withdraw before Monday of Week 4 of any term then you will not usually be liable for fees for that term. If you withdraw after Monday of Week 4 of any term, you will be liable for fees for that term. Different policies apply to certain courses delivered by Saïd Business School and the Department for Continuing Education and for courses with a modular structure. If you are thinking about withdrawing, you should talk to your college or your department to discuss your options.What if I suspend from my course, am I eligible for a refund?The same rules apply for suspension as for withdrawal.If you are considering suspending your studies you should talk to your college or your department to discuss your options.I'm a research student and I'm planning on submitting my thesis early, do I have to keep paying course fees?If you are a research student and are planning to submit your thesis before you reach your maximum fee liability, you only need to pay fees up to and including the term in which you submit your thesis. For example, if you submit your DPhil thesis in the 8th term since starting, you will pay 8 terms of fees but not fees for the 9th term. If your thesis is referred back to you then you may be liable for a re-submission charge. Please refer to the Other charges page for more information.I'm a research student and I'm conducting research outside Oxford, do I still have to pay course fees?Yes, course fees are payable whether you are in Oxford or are conducting research elsewhere. Research programmes have a standard period of fee liability, more information on this is available in the fee liability section of this page.I think I've been charged the wrong fee, what should I do?You should contact your college in the first instance. The college will contact the relevant University departments and your fee will be investigated. If you are not satisfied with the result of the investigation, you may petition the Fees Panel. For more information on how to petition the Fees Panel, please email the Student Fees Team. Requests for refunds will not normally be considered more than one year after the fee has been paid.What happens if I don't pay my fees?If you don't pay your course fees, at the University’s discretion you will be suspended from your course and from access to all University facilities. You will not be allowed to sit any examinations or submit any coursework. If you are having difficulty paying your fees, we recommend you talk to your college at the earliest opportunity.Where can I get more information?The rules regarding payment of fees and refunds are in the Examination Regulations, Regulations on Financial Matters, Section 1, Subsection 3. You can also discuss payments and refunds with your college.\nCourse feesThe course fees paid by matriculated students* are for the provision of tuition, supervision, academic services and facilities by the University (including your department or faculty) and the colleges, but do not include residential or other living costs.Up to and including the academic year 2018/19, separate figures have been published on the university website for university fees and for college fees: the total payable is the sum of these two figures. From the academic year 2019/20, course fees for matriculated students are published as a single figure. This change is intended to ensure that the total level of fees payable is in all cases completely clear. Home PGCE students can access a tuition fee loan from the UK government to cover their course fee in full.The course fees you pay include your fees for both University and college services and are divided between the University (including your department or faculty) and your college on a formula basis.

You should visit your college's website to check payment arrangements.Frequently asked questionsWho do I pay fees to?Course fees are payable to your college (check payment arrangements as these can differ from college to college) except for a small number of courses delivered by Saïd Business School and the Department for Continuing Education which collect fees direct. Fees for courses with a modular structure are usually paid direct to the department. If you are a Home undergraduate and you have taken out a UK government tuition fee loan, this will be paid direct to the University. Your college may ask for evidence of the loan.When do I have to pay my fees?Course fees for the full academic year are payable no later than Week 1 in the term in which study commences. We recommend you contact your college to check payment arrangements.How should I pay my fees?As course fees are collected by colleges, you should visit your college's website for more information about acceptable methods of payment.Can I pay in instalments?Course fees are payable annually in advance.  In exceptional circumstances your college may allow you to pay by instalments. You should contact your college as soon as possible before the start of the academic year if you would like to investigate this.What if I withdraw from my course, am I eligible for a refund?If you withdraw from your course, you will generally be eligible for a refund of course fees for each complete term not started. If you withdraw during a term, you may be liable for fees for that term depending on the date of your withdrawal. If you withdraw before Monday of Week 4 of any term then you will not usually be liable for fees for that term. If you withdraw after Monday of Week 4 of any term, you will be liable for fees for that term. Different policies apply to certain courses delivered by Saïd Business School and the Department for Continuing Education and for courses with a modular structure. If you are thinking about withdrawing, you should talk to your college or your department to discuss your options.What if I suspend from my course, am I eligible for a refund?The same rules apply for suspension as for withdrawal.If you are considering suspending your studies you should talk to your college or your department to discuss your options.I'm a research student and I'm planning on submitting my thesis early, do I have to keep paying course fees?If you are a research student and are planning to submit your thesis before you reach your maximum fee liability, you only need to pay fees up to and including the term in which you submit your thesis. For example, if you submit your DPhil thesis in the 8th term since starting, you will pay 8 terms of fees but not fees for the 9th term. If your thesis is referred back to you then you may be liable for a re-submission charge. Please refer to the Other charges page for more information.I'm a research student and I'm conducting research outside Oxford, do I still have to pay course fees?Yes, course fees are payable whether you are in Oxford or are conducting research elsewhere. Research programmes have a standard period of fee liability, more information on this is available in the fee liability section of this page.I think I've been charged the wrong fee, what should I do?You should contact your college in the first instance. The college will contact the relevant University departments and your fee will be investigated. If you are not satisfied with the result of the investigation, you may petition the Fees Panel. For more information on how to petition the Fees Panel, please email the Student Fees Team. Requests for refunds will not normally be considered more than one year after the fee has been paid.What happens if I don't pay my fees?If you don't pay your course fees, at the University’s discretion you will be suspended from your course and from access to all University facilities. You will not be allowed to sit any examinations or submit any coursework. If you are having difficulty paying your fees, we recommend you talk to your college at the earliest opportunity.Where can I get more information?The rules regarding payment of fees and refunds are in the Examination Regulations, Regulations on Financial Matters, Section 1, Subsection 3. You can also discuss payments and refunds with your college.",

Grant levels vary.\nThe University is currently able to process applications for US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) funding (also known as the GI Bill or Post 9/11 Bill) and can complete and submit certificates of enrolment to the VA.\nThe University can certify enrolment for most degree-bearing courses which are matriculated, i.e. you are a full member of the University. Please be aware that it can take a long time to receive VA funding so you should not rely on VA benefits to fund a course deposit, or fees and living expenses early on in your course.\nAm I eligible?\nBefore you start, please read the information about using VA benefits at foreign schools on the VA's website.\nThe VA’s eligibility requirements are different for foreign schools, compared with those in the US. In order to use your VA benefits at Oxford, you must meet the same basic eligibility requirements for studying in the US and:\nNon-degree-bearing courses, such as undergraduate and graduate certificates and diplomas are not eligible. Courses involving online study or distance learning are also ineligible.\nIf you are unsure whether your course is eligible for VA benefits at Oxford, please get in touch with the US Loans team.\nHow to apply\nStep 1 - In order to apply for VA funding at Oxford you must first make an application directly to the VA once you have received an offer of a place to study on your chosen course. Please visit the US Department of Veterans Affairs website and consult their information for foreign schools. We recommend that you check the current benefit rates to get an idea of the benefits you might be eligible for at Oxford.\nOnce you have applied, the VA will send you a Certificate of Eligibility.\nStep 2 – Email the US loans team with a copy of your Certificate of Eligibility.\nStep 3 - Complete our VA funding form to ensure we have the information we need to certify your enrolment to the VA.\nStep 4 – If your course has not yet been approved by the VA, the University will submit a request to the VA on your behalf. You can check whether your course has been approved using the VA's GI Bill Comparison Tool. Please be aware that it can take several months to receive a response to course approval requests. If your course is not yet approved, please complete the above steps as soon as possible to minimise delays to any funding you are eligible to receive.\nStep 5 – Once you have enrolled on your course, the US loans team will certify your enrolment to the VA.\nStep 6 – If you are eligible to receive a Monthly Housing Allowance (MHA), the VA requires that you verify your enrolment each month to confirm that you remain enrolled on the same course. Information on how to do this can be found on the Enrollment Verification page of the VA’s website.\nHow much will I receive?\nThe VA do not share their calculations with us so we cannot predict how much you will receive. You should be able to get a good idea by checking the current benefit rates, but please be aware that the amount you will receive depends on your individual benefit entitlement and enrolment details.\nIf you are eligible for education benefits under the Post-9/11 GI Bill, you should be aware that tuition benefits at foreign schools are capped at $29,920.95 per year (in 2025-26). Depending on your benefit entitlement and course fees, the VA will pay the University up to this capped amount. If your annual course fee exceeds this amount, you will be responsible for paying the difference.\nYou may also be eligible to receive a Monthly Housing Allowance (MHA) and book stipend. The amount you will receive depends on your benefit entitlement and whether you are enrolled full time or part time. Most part time courses at Oxford are half time or less and therefore you will not usually be eligible to receive MHA if you are studying part time.\nReceiving VA funding\nIf your course is already approved by the VA, the University generally expects to receive the funds around 4-5 weeks after certifying your enrolment. The funds will be paid to the University and transferred to the relevant college or department for the payment of fees. Any remainder will be remitted to you.\nYou may consider using other funding, such as a US federal or private education loan to cover the financial declaration and expenses early on in your course, and then use the VA funding to repay the loan when it arrives.\nVA also offers the Edith Nourse Rogers STEM Scholarship for students training in high demand STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) fields.\nRecipients will receive up to nine months of additional Post-9/11 GI Bill entitlement or a maximum of $30,000. Eligible Post-9/11 GI Bill students must have either exhausted their entitlement or will exhaust their entitlement within 180 days.\nFor additional information, please visit the Rogers STEM Scholarship website.\nThe US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) requires schools to review prior credit, experience, and training, and grant credit as appropriate towards a VA student’s current programme. This policy applies to new students, students transferring from another institution to the University of Oxford, and current students transferring programmes within the University of Oxford.\nPlease contact the US loans team if you have any questions about the information given below.\nEntry requirements\nAdmissions policies and procedures apply to new students. The links below provide an overview of the University of Oxford's general admissions policies and procedures:\nIn order to take up the offer of a place to study at Oxford, all applicants must meet the qualification requirements of their course. Students should check the course page for individual programme admission requirements. If your qualifications are not from the UK, please also refer to the information on international qualifications for undergraduates and international qualifications for graduate students for guidance on the grades and qualifications that are considered equivalent to the University’s minimum entry requirements.\nProviding evidence of prior credit\nUndergraduate applicants must provide details about their education as part of their UCAS application. Applicants must list all qualifications along with the grades that have already been achieved and any standardised test scores. Applicants also need to list any educational qualifications that they are currently working towards. Those applying for a second undergraduate degree will need to send a transcript from their first degree separately to the college that is considering their application. For full information, please refer to the undergraduate guide for applicants.\nGraduate applicants should provide details of all qualifications and periods of study undertaken at university level, including qualifications that have not yet been completed, on the ‘Qualifications’ tab of the graduate application form. Non-UK qualifications do not need to be converted to UK degree classification, and an official statement of comparability from UK ENIC is not required. For each qualification entered, an official transcript should be uploaded. For full information, please refer to the graduate application guide.\nPrior Credit Review Process\nUndergraduate applications are assessed by academic tutors, usually from a college. Tutors make decisions based on all aspects of your application, including your interview, any admissions tests or written work required for your course, your prior academic attainment and predicted grades, your personal statement, the academic reference.\nGraduate applications are academically assessed against the entry requirements for the course and relatively in terms of the quality of previous academic excellence and future potential in comparison with the applications received from other candidates for that course. The academic department that offers the course you apply to will assess the academic quality and suitability of your application. After this is complete, the department will send you formal notification of their decision by email.\nTransfers and applying whilst studying at another University\nOxford University does not normally accept transfer students. If you wish to follow an undergraduate course or graduate taught course at Oxford, you would need to start the course from the beginning and follow the normal applications process for the course. The arrangements for student course transfers details the process by which a current student, either at Oxford or at another institution, moves from one course to another, or from one mode of study to another.\nStudents already in receipt of an undergraduate degree, and wishing to study a further undergraduate degree may apply for ‘senior status’ at Oxford, allowing them to be admitted directly to the Final Honour School for the degree. Students should follow the normal applications process for the course selecting Year 2 as their point of entry.\nPostgraduate research (PGR) students will only be considered for transfer to Oxford from another institution as a result of their main supervisor relocating to Oxford to take up an academic position. Students wishing to transfer are required to complete a graduate application form. An application to Education Committee is also required to permit work undertaken and time spent at the previous institution to count towards the requirements for the relevant award (‘antedated admission’). Permission may also be requested from Education Committee to waive transfer of status requirements, if appropriate. All applications must have the support of the relevant department and of a college willing to take the student.\nWritten records of previous education\nThe University retains a written record of students’ previous qualifications and Oxford academic history within the student system in accordance with the Student Privacy Policy. Your rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 2018 are outlined on the University's Data protection page.\nAny employment during study must adhere to the University's Paid work guidelines. Within these guidelines, the following may be possible:\nAd-hoc work can sometimes be found by advertising your skills locally as a tutor, translator or proof-reader. Part-time or seasonal work for the University and colleges may also be available, for example, invigilating examinations, administrative work or working in one of Oxford’s many libraries.\nA good source of part-time and temporary vacancies in Oxford is the Career Service’s online resource, CareerConnect. There are also several local job websites that provide details of vacancies in Oxford.\nIf you have recent work experience, it may be worth contacting one of your past or present employers to find out whether they would be able to offer you support. You could also consider approaching a potential employer of the future. Investigate companies or organisations working in your research area, particularly those with corporate social responsibility (CSR) aims and target them.\nThink creatively and strategically about other bodies you may be able to proactively approach for funding. They might not necessarily advertise scholarships or bursaries, but could you make a convincing case for them to support you? Are there any foundations in your local or home community that would be willing to support you?\nWhen approaching an employer or other potential funding body, make sure you consider:\nIn addition to the above, think about what you can offer a potential sponsor. Could you undertake some research for them, give them free publicity, give a lecture/presentation, write a report etc?\nIf you have a query about graduate admissions at Oxford, we're here to help:\nAsk a question\nPostgraduate Applicant Privacy Policy\n• External scholarships\n• Veterans Affairs\n• Employment\n• be enrolled on an eligible, degree-bearing course\n• undertake your studies in Oxford\n• Undergraduate Admissions\n• Graduate Admissions\n• Continuing Education\n• Teaching opportunities: departments and colleges are sometimes able to offer teaching work.

Grant levels vary.\nUS Department of Veterans Affairs fundingThe University is currently able to process applications for US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) funding (also known as the GI Bill or Post 9/11 Bill) and can complete and submit certificates of enrolment to the VA. The University can certify enrolment for most degree-bearing courses which are matriculated, i.e. you are a full member of the University. Please be aware that it can take a long time to receive VA funding so you should not rely on VA benefits to fund a course deposit, or fees and living expenses early on in your course.Am I eligible?Before you start, please read the information about using VA benefits at foreign schools on the VA's website.The VA’s eligibility requirements are different for foreign schools, compared with those in the US. In order to use your VA benefits at Oxford, you must meet the same basic eligibility requirements for studying in the US and:be enrolled on an eligible, degree-bearing courseundertake your studies in OxfordNon-degree-bearing courses, such as undergraduate and graduate certificates and diplomas are not eligible. Courses involving online study or distance learning are also ineligible.If you are unsure whether your course is eligible for VA benefits at Oxford, please get in touch with the US Loans team.How to applyStep 1 - In order to apply for VA funding at Oxford you must first make an application directly to the VA once you have received an offer of a place to study on your chosen course. Please visit the US Department of Veterans Affairs website and consult their information for foreign schools. We recommend that you check the current benefit rates to get an idea of the benefits you might be eligible for at Oxford.Once you have applied, the VA will send you a Certificate of Eligibility.Step 2 – Email the US loans team with a copy of your Certificate of Eligibility. Step 3 - Complete our VA funding form to ensure we have the information we need to certify your enrolment to the VA.Step 4 – If your course has not yet been approved by the VA, the University will submit a request to the VA on your behalf. You can check whether your course has been approved using the VA's GI Bill Comparison Tool. Please be aware that it can take several months to receive a response to course approval requests. If your course is not yet approved, please complete the above steps as soon as possible to minimise delays to any funding you are eligible to receive.Step 5 – Once you have enrolled on your course, the US loans team will certify your enrolment to the VA.Step 6 – If you are eligible to receive a Monthly Housing Allowance (MHA), the VA requires that you verify your enrolment each month to confirm that you remain enrolled on the same course. Information on how to do this can be found on the Enrollment Verification page of the VA’s website.How much will I receive?The VA do not share their calculations with us so we cannot predict how much you will receive. You should be able to get a good idea by checking the current benefit rates, but please be aware that the amount you will receive depends on your individual benefit entitlement and enrolment details. If you are eligible for education benefits under the Post-9/11 GI Bill, you should be aware that tuition benefits at foreign schools are capped at $29,920.95 per year (in 2025-26). Depending on your benefit entitlement and course fees, the VA will pay the University up to this capped amount. If your annual course fee exceeds this amount, you will be responsible for paying the difference.You may also be eligible to receive a Monthly Housing Allowance (MHA) and book stipend. The amount you will receive depends on your benefit entitlement and whether you are enrolled full time or part time. Most part time courses at Oxford are half time or less and therefore you will not usually be eligible to receive MHA if you are studying part time.Receiving VA fundingIf your course is already approved by the VA, the University generally expects to receive the funds around 4-5 weeks after certifying your enrolment. The funds will be paid to the University and transferred to the relevant college or department for the payment of fees. Any remainder will be remitted to you.You may consider using other funding, such as a US federal or private education loan to cover the financial declaration and expenses early on in your course, and then use the VA funding to repay the loan when it arrives.Edith Nourse Rogers STEM ScholarshipVA also offers the Edith Nourse Rogers STEM Scholarship for students training in high demand STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) fields.Recipients will receive up to nine months of additional Post-9/11 GI Bill entitlement or a maximum of $30,000. Eligible Post-9/11 GI Bill students must have either exhausted their entitlement or will exhaust their entitlement within 180 days. For additional information, please visit the Rogers STEM Scholarship website.Prior Credit Review Policy for US Department of Veterans Affairs BeneficiariesThe US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) requires schools to review prior credit, experience, and training, and grant credit as appropriate towards a VA student’s current programme. This policy applies to new students, students transferring from another institution to the University of Oxford, and current students transferring programmes within the University of Oxford.Please contact the US loans team if you have any questions about the information given below.Entry requirementsAdmissions policies and procedures apply to new students. The links below provide an overview of the University of Oxford's general admissions policies and procedures:Undergraduate AdmissionsGraduate AdmissionsContinuing EducationIn order to take up the offer of a place to study at Oxford, all applicants must meet the qualification requirements of their course. Students should check the course page for individual programme admission requirements. If your qualifications are not from the UK, please also refer to the information on international qualifications for undergraduates and international qualifications for graduate students for guidance on the grades and qualifications that are considered equivalent to the University’s minimum entry requirements.Providing evidence of prior creditUndergraduate applicants must provide details about their education as part of their UCAS application. Applicants must list all qualifications along with the grades that have already been achieved and any standardised test scores. Applicants also need to list any educational qualifications that they are currently working towards. Those applying for a second undergraduate degree will need to send a transcript from their first degree separately to the college that is considering their application. For full information, please refer to the undergraduate guide for applicants.Graduate applicants should provide details of all qualifications and periods of study undertaken at university level, including qualifications that have not yet been completed, on the ‘Qualifications’ tab of the graduate application form. Non-UK qualifications do not need to be converted to UK degree classification, and an official statement of comparability from UK ENIC is not required. For each qualification entered, an official transcript should be uploaded. For full information, please refer to the graduate application guide.Prior Credit Review ProcessUndergraduate applications are assessed by academic tutors, usually from a college. Tutors make decisions based on all aspects of your application, including your interview, any admissions tests or written work required for your course, your prior academic attainment and predicted grades, your personal statement, the academic reference.Graduate applications are academically assessed against the entry requirements for the course and relatively in terms of the quality of previous academic excellence and future potential in comparison with the applications received from other candidates for that course. The academic department that offers the course you apply to will assess the academic quality and suitability of your application. After this is complete, the department will send you formal notification of their decision by email.Transfers and applying whilst studying at another UniversityOxford University does not normally accept transfer students. If you wish to follow an undergraduate course or graduate taught course at Oxford, you would need to start the course from the beginning and follow the normal applications process for the course. The arrangements for student course transfers details the process by which a current student, either at Oxford or at another institution, moves from one course to another, or from one mode of study to another.Students already in receipt of an undergraduate degree, and wishing to study a further undergraduate degree may apply for ‘senior status’ at Oxford, allowing them to be admitted directly to the Final Honour School for the degree. Students should follow the normal applications process for the course selecting Year 2 as their point of entry.Postgraduate research (PGR) students will only be considered for transfer to Oxford from another institution as a result of their main supervisor relocating to Oxford to take up an academic position. Students wishing to transfer are required to complete a graduate application form. An application to Education Committee is also required to permit work undertaken and time spent at the previous institution to count towards the requirements for the relevant award (‘antedated admission’). Permission may also be requested from Education Committee to waive transfer of status requirements, if appropriate. All applications must have the support of the relevant department and of a college willing to take the student.Written records of previous educationThe University retains a written record of students’ previous qualifications and Oxford academic history within the student system in accordance with the Student Privacy Policy. Your rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 2018 are outlined on the University's Data protection page.\nEmploymentAny employment during study must adhere to the University's Paid work guidelines. Within these guidelines, the following may be possible:Teaching opportunities: departments and colleges are sometimes able to offer teaching work. Some departments have graduate teaching schemes in place; please contact your department or faculty for more information.Demonstrator opportunities: in the experimental sciences, demonstrators are sometimes required for practical classes.Research Assistantships: these roles are sometimes available in departments and faculties.Junior Deans: these positions involve providing pastoral care to other students and being on-call day and night several times a week. Junior Deans normally receive free college accommodation, free meals and a small stipend. These positions are normally advertised on college websites and the college vacancies section of the Conference of Colleges website.Ad-hoc work can sometimes be found by advertising your skills locally as a tutor, translator or proof-reader. Part-time or seasonal work for the University and colleges may also be available, for example, invigilating examinations, administrative work or working in one of Oxford’s many libraries.A good source of part-time and temporary vacancies in Oxford is the Career Service’s online resource, CareerConnect. There are also several local job websites that provide details of vacancies in Oxford.Other possibilitiesIf you have recent work experience, it may be worth contacting one of your past or present employers to find out whether they would be able to offer you support. You could also consider approaching a potential employer of the future. Investigate companies or organisations working in your research area, particularly those with corporate social responsibility (CSR) aims and target them.Think creatively and strategically about other bodies you may be able to proactively approach for funding. They might not necessarily advertise scholarships or bursaries, but could you make a convincing case for them to support you? Are there any foundations in your local or home community that would be willing to support you?When approaching an employer or other potential funding body, make sure you consider:your initial approach, especially if the organisation does not appear to provide support for graduate students, needs to be concise, memorable and tailored to the needs and aims of the body you are contacting;taking the time to get a contact name in the organisation rather than sending a generic, open letter to the CEO;enclosing a short version of your research proposal or statement of purpose, remembering that you may need to make it more user-friendly for non-specialists;being specific - how much funding do you need? Could any of this come from in-kind support (equipment/use of research facilities/work experience etc), and what will you use the funds for?In addition to the above, think about what you can offer a potential sponsor. Could you undertake some research for them, give them free publicity, give a lecture/presentation, write a report etc?\n\n\n\n\n\nWas this page useful?* \n Yes \n\n\n No \n\n\n\n\nPlease tell us what you want to see on this page, the more specific you can be the more likely it is that we can add it. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan't find what you're looking for?If you have a query about graduate admissions at Oxford, we're here to help:Ask a question\n\n\nPrivacy PolicyPostgraduate Applicant Privacy Policy\n\n\n\n\n\nShare This\n\nTweet\n\n\nShare on Facebook\n\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\n\nShare on Reddit\nA view down Brasenose Lane towards the Radcliffe Camera\n\n\n(Image Credit: Mike Navarrete / Graduate Photography Competition)\nA view down Brasenose Lane towards the Radcliffe Camera\n\n\n(Image Credit: Mike Navarrete / Graduate Photography Competition)\nA view down Brasenose Lane towards the Radcliffe Camera\n(Image Credit: Mike Navarrete / Graduate Photography Competition)\nExternal scholarshipsVeterans AffairsEmployment\n\nAlongside Oxford funding, there are many other funding options available.

Grant levels vary.\nUS Department of Veterans Affairs fundingThe University is currently able to process applications for US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) funding (also known as the GI Bill or Post 9/11 Bill) and can complete and submit certificates of enrolment to the VA. The University can certify enrolment for most degree-bearing courses which are matriculated, i.e. you are a full member of the University. Please be aware that it can take a long time to receive VA funding so you should not rely on VA benefits to fund a course deposit, or fees and living expenses early on in your course.Am I eligible?Before you start, please read the information about using VA benefits at foreign schools on the VA's website.The VA’s eligibility requirements are different for foreign schools, compared with those in the US. In order to use your VA benefits at Oxford, you must meet the same basic eligibility requirements for studying in the US and:be enrolled on an eligible, degree-bearing courseundertake your studies in OxfordNon-degree-bearing courses, such as undergraduate and graduate certificates and diplomas are not eligible. Courses involving online study or distance learning are also ineligible.If you are unsure whether your course is eligible for VA benefits at Oxford, please get in touch with the US Loans team.How to applyStep 1 - In order to apply for VA funding at Oxford you must first make an application directly to the VA once you have received an offer of a place to study on your chosen course. Please visit the US Department of Veterans Affairs website and consult their information for foreign schools. We recommend that you check the current benefit rates to get an idea of the benefits you might be eligible for at Oxford.Once you have applied, the VA will send you a Certificate of Eligibility.Step 2 – Email the US loans team with a copy of your Certificate of Eligibility. Step 3 - Complete our VA funding form to ensure we have the information we need to certify your enrolment to the VA.Step 4 – If your course has not yet been approved by the VA, the University will submit a request to the VA on your behalf. You can check whether your course has been approved using the VA's GI Bill Comparison Tool. Please be aware that it can take several months to receive a response to course approval requests. If your course is not yet approved, please complete the above steps as soon as possible to minimise delays to any funding you are eligible to receive.Step 5 – Once you have enrolled on your course, the US loans team will certify your enrolment to the VA.Step 6 – If you are eligible to receive a Monthly Housing Allowance (MHA), the VA requires that you verify your enrolment each month to confirm that you remain enrolled on the same course. Information on how to do this can be found on the Enrollment Verification page of the VA’s website.How much will I receive?The VA do not share their calculations with us so we cannot predict how much you will receive. You should be able to get a good idea by checking the current benefit rates, but please be aware that the amount you will receive depends on your individual benefit entitlement and enrolment details. If you are eligible for education benefits under the Post-9/11 GI Bill, you should be aware that tuition benefits at foreign schools are capped at $29,920.95 per year (in 2025-26). Depending on your benefit entitlement and course fees, the VA will pay the University up to this capped amount. If your annual course fee exceeds this amount, you will be responsible for paying the difference.You may also be eligible to receive a Monthly Housing Allowance (MHA) and book stipend. The amount you will receive depends on your benefit entitlement and whether you are enrolled full time or part time. Most part time courses at Oxford are half time or less and therefore you will not usually be eligible to receive MHA if you are studying part time.Receiving VA fundingIf your course is already approved by the VA, the University generally expects to receive the funds around 4-5 weeks after certifying your enrolment. The funds will be paid to the University and transferred to the relevant college or department for the payment of fees. Any remainder will be remitted to you.You may consider using other funding, such as a US federal or private education loan to cover the financial declaration and expenses early on in your course, and then use the VA funding to repay the loan when it arrives.Edith Nourse Rogers STEM ScholarshipVA also offers the Edith Nourse Rogers STEM Scholarship for students training in high demand STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) fields.Recipients will receive up to nine months of additional Post-9/11 GI Bill entitlement or a maximum of $30,000. Eligible Post-9/11 GI Bill students must have either exhausted their entitlement or will exhaust their entitlement within 180 days. For additional information, please visit the Rogers STEM Scholarship website.Prior Credit Review Policy for US Department of Veterans Affairs BeneficiariesThe US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) requires schools to review prior credit, experience, and training, and grant credit as appropriate towards a VA student’s current programme. This policy applies to new students, students transferring from another institution to the University of Oxford, and current students transferring programmes within the University of Oxford.Please contact the US loans team if you have any questions about the information given below.Entry requirementsAdmissions policies and procedures apply to new students. The links below provide an overview of the University of Oxford's general admissions policies and procedures:Undergraduate AdmissionsGraduate AdmissionsContinuing EducationIn order to take up the offer of a place to study at Oxford, all applicants must meet the qualification requirements of their course. Students should check the course page for individual programme admission requirements. If your qualifications are not from the UK, please also refer to the information on international qualifications for undergraduates and international qualifications for graduate students for guidance on the grades and qualifications that are considered equivalent to the University’s minimum entry requirements.Providing evidence of prior creditUndergraduate applicants must provide details about their education as part of their UCAS application. Applicants must list all qualifications along with the grades that have already been achieved and any standardised test scores. Applicants also need to list any educational qualifications that they are currently working towards. Those applying for a second undergraduate degree will need to send a transcript from their first degree separately to the college that is considering their application. For full information, please refer to the undergraduate guide for applicants.Graduate applicants should provide details of all qualifications and periods of study undertaken at university level, including qualifications that have not yet been completed, on the ‘Qualifications’ tab of the graduate application form. Non-UK qualifications do not need to be converted to UK degree classification, and an official statement of comparability from UK ENIC is not required. For each qualification entered, an official transcript should be uploaded. For full information, please refer to the graduate application guide.Prior Credit Review ProcessUndergraduate applications are assessed by academic tutors, usually from a college. Tutors make decisions based on all aspects of your application, including your interview, any admissions tests or written work required for your course, your prior academic attainment and predicted grades, your personal statement, the academic reference.Graduate applications are academically assessed against the entry requirements for the course and relatively in terms of the quality of previous academic excellence and future potential in comparison with the applications received from other candidates for that course. The academic department that offers the course you apply to will assess the academic quality and suitability of your application. After this is complete, the department will send you formal notification of their decision by email.Transfers and applying whilst studying at another UniversityOxford University does not normally accept transfer students. If you wish to follow an undergraduate course or graduate taught course at Oxford, you would need to start the course from the beginning and follow the normal applications process for the course. The arrangements for student course transfers details the process by which a current student, either at Oxford or at another institution, moves from one course to another, or from one mode of study to another.Students already in receipt of an undergraduate degree, and wishing to study a further undergraduate degree may apply for ‘senior status’ at Oxford, allowing them to be admitted directly to the Final Honour School for the degree. Students should follow the normal applications process for the course selecting Year 2 as their point of entry.Postgraduate research (PGR) students will only be considered for transfer to Oxford from another institution as a result of their main supervisor relocating to Oxford to take up an academic position. Students wishing to transfer are required to complete a graduate application form. An application to Education Committee is also required to permit work undertaken and time spent at the previous institution to count towards the requirements for the relevant award (‘antedated admission’). Permission may also be requested from Education Committee to waive transfer of status requirements, if appropriate. All applications must have the support of the relevant department and of a college willing to take the student.Written records of previous educationThe University retains a written record of students’ previous qualifications and Oxford academic history within the student system in accordance with the Student Privacy Policy. Your rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 2018 are outlined on the University's Data protection page.\nEmploymentAny employment during study must adhere to the University's Paid work guidelines. Within these guidelines, the following may be possible:Teaching opportunities: departments and colleges are sometimes able to offer teaching work. Some departments have graduate teaching schemes in place; please contact your department or faculty for more information.Demonstrator opportunities: in the experimental sciences, demonstrators are sometimes required for practical classes.Research Assistantships: these roles are sometimes available in departments and faculties.Junior Deans: these positions involve providing pastoral care to other students and being on-call day and night several times a week. Junior Deans normally receive free college accommodation, free meals and a small stipend. These positions are normally advertised on college websites and the college vacancies section of the Conference of Colleges website.Ad-hoc work can sometimes be found by advertising your skills locally as a tutor, translator or proof-reader. Part-time or seasonal work for the University and colleges may also be available, for example, invigilating examinations, administrative work or working in one of Oxford’s many libraries.A good source of part-time and temporary vacancies in Oxford is the Career Service’s online resource, CareerConnect. There are also several local job websites that provide details of vacancies in Oxford.Other possibilitiesIf you have recent work experience, it may be worth contacting one of your past or present employers to find out whether they would be able to offer you support. You could also consider approaching a potential employer of the future. Investigate companies or organisations working in your research area, particularly those with corporate social responsibility (CSR) aims and target them.Think creatively and strategically about other bodies you may be able to proactively approach for funding. They might not necessarily advertise scholarships or bursaries, but could you make a convincing case for them to support you? Are there any foundations in your local or home community that would be willing to support you?When approaching an employer or other potential funding body, make sure you consider:your initial approach, especially if the organisation does not appear to provide support for graduate students, needs to be concise, memorable and tailored to the needs and aims of the body you are contacting;taking the time to get a contact name in the organisation rather than sending a generic, open letter to the CEO;enclosing a short version of your research proposal or statement of purpose, remembering that you may need to make it more user-friendly for non-specialists;being specific - how much funding do you need? Could any of this come from in-kind support (equipment/use of research facilities/work experience etc), and what will you use the funds for?In addition to the above, think about what you can offer a potential sponsor. Could you undertake some research for them, give them free publicity, give a lecture/presentation, write a report etc?\nAlongside Oxford funding, there are many other funding options available.

Are there any foundations in your local or home community that would be willing to support you?When approaching an employer or other potential funding body, make sure you consider:your initial approach, especially if the organisation does not appear to provide support for graduate students, needs to be concise, memorable and tailored to the needs and aims of the body you are contacting;taking the time to get a contact name in the organisation rather than sending a generic, open letter to the CEO;enclosing a short version of your research proposal or statement of purpose, remembering that you may need to make it more user-friendly for non-specialists;being specific - how much funding do you need? Could any of this come from in-kind support (equipment/use of research facilities/work experience etc), and what will you use the funds for?In addition to the above, think about what you can offer a potential sponsor.

Grant levels vary.\nUS Department of Veterans Affairs fundingThe University is currently able to process applications for US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) funding (also known as the GI Bill or Post 9/11 Bill) and can complete and submit certificates of enrolment to the VA. The University can certify enrolment for most degree-bearing courses which are matriculated, i.e. you are a full member of the University. Please be aware that it can take a long time to receive VA funding so you should not rely on VA benefits to fund a course deposit, or fees and living expenses early on in your course.Am I eligible?Before you start, please read the information about using VA benefits at foreign schools on the VA's website.The VA’s eligibility requirements are different for foreign schools, compared with those in the US. In order to use your VA benefits at Oxford, you must meet the same basic eligibility requirements for studying in the US and:be enrolled on an eligible, degree-bearing courseundertake your studies in OxfordNon-degree-bearing courses, such as undergraduate and graduate certificates and diplomas are not eligible. Courses involving online study or distance learning are also ineligible.If you are unsure whether your course is eligible for VA benefits at Oxford, please get in touch with the US Loans team.How to applyStep 1 - In order to apply for VA funding at Oxford you must first make an application directly to the VA once you have received an offer of a place to study on your chosen course. Please visit the US Department of Veterans Affairs website and consult their information for foreign schools. We recommend that you check the current benefit rates to get an idea of the benefits you might be eligible for at Oxford.Once you have applied, the VA will send you a Certificate of Eligibility.Step 2 – Email the US loans team with a copy of your Certificate of Eligibility. Step 3 - Complete our VA funding form to ensure we have the information we need to certify your enrolment to the VA.Step 4 – If your course has not yet been approved by the VA, the University will submit a request to the VA on your behalf. You can check whether your course has been approved using the VA's GI Bill Comparison Tool. Please be aware that it can take several months to receive a response to course approval requests. If your course is not yet approved, please complete the above steps as soon as possible to minimise delays to any funding you are eligible to receive.Step 5 – Once you have enrolled on your course, the US loans team will certify your enrolment to the VA.Step 6 – If you are eligible to receive a Monthly Housing Allowance (MHA), the VA requires that you verify your enrolment each month to confirm that you remain enrolled on the same course. Information on how to do this can be found on the Enrollment Verification page of the VA’s website.How much will I receive?The VA do not share their calculations with us so we cannot predict how much you will receive. You should be able to get a good idea by checking the current benefit rates, but please be aware that the amount you will receive depends on your individual benefit entitlement and enrolment details. If you are eligible for education benefits under the Post-9/11 GI Bill, you should be aware that tuition benefits at foreign schools are capped at $29,920.95 per year (in 2025-26). Depending on your benefit entitlement and course fees, the VA will pay the University up to this capped amount. If your annual course fee exceeds this amount, you will be responsible for paying the difference.You may also be eligible to receive a Monthly Housing Allowance (MHA) and book stipend. The amount you will receive depends on your benefit entitlement and whether you are enrolled full time or part time. Most part time courses at Oxford are half time or less and therefore you will not usually be eligible to receive MHA if you are studying part time.Receiving VA fundingIf your course is already approved by the VA, the University generally expects to receive the funds around 4-5 weeks after certifying your enrolment. The funds will be paid to the University and transferred to the relevant college or department for the payment of fees. Any remainder will be remitted to you.You may consider using other funding, such as a US federal or private education loan to cover the financial declaration and expenses early on in your course, and then use the VA funding to repay the loan when it arrives.Edith Nourse Rogers STEM ScholarshipVA also offers the Edith Nourse Rogers STEM Scholarship for students training in high demand STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) fields.Recipients will receive up to nine months of additional Post-9/11 GI Bill entitlement or a maximum of $30,000. Eligible Post-9/11 GI Bill students must have either exhausted their entitlement or will exhaust their entitlement within 180 days. For additional information, please visit the Rogers STEM Scholarship website.Prior Credit Review Policy for US Department of Veterans Affairs BeneficiariesThe US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) requires schools to review prior credit, experience, and training, and grant credit as appropriate towards a VA student’s current programme. This policy applies to new students, students transferring from another institution to the University of Oxford, and current students transferring programmes within the University of Oxford.Please contact the US loans team if you have any questions about the information given below.Entry requirementsAdmissions policies and procedures apply to new students. The links below provide an overview of the University of Oxford's general admissions policies and procedures:Undergraduate AdmissionsGraduate AdmissionsContinuing EducationIn order to take up the offer of a place to study at Oxford, all applicants must meet the qualification requirements of their course. Students should check the course page for individual programme admission requirements. If your qualifications are not from the UK, please also refer to the information on international qualifications for undergraduates and international qualifications for graduate students for guidance on the grades and qualifications that are considered equivalent to the University’s minimum entry requirements.Providing evidence of prior creditUndergraduate applicants must provide details about their education as part of their UCAS application. Applicants must list all qualifications along with the grades that have already been achieved and any standardised test scores. Applicants also need to list any educational qualifications that they are currently working towards. Those applying for a second undergraduate degree will need to send a transcript from their first degree separately to the college that is considering their application. For full information, please refer to the undergraduate guide for applicants.Graduate applicants should provide details of all qualifications and periods of study undertaken at university level, including qualifications that have not yet been completed, on the ‘Qualifications’ tab of the graduate application form. Non-UK qualifications do not need to be converted to UK degree classification, and an official statement of comparability from UK ENIC is not required. For each qualification entered, an official transcript should be uploaded. For full information, please refer to the graduate application guide.Prior Credit Review ProcessUndergraduate applications are assessed by academic tutors, usually from a college. Tutors make decisions based on all aspects of your application, including your interview, any admissions tests or written work required for your course, your prior academic attainment and predicted grades, your personal statement, the academic reference.Graduate applications are academically assessed against the entry requirements for the course and relatively in terms of the quality of previous academic excellence and future potential in comparison with the applications received from other candidates for that course. The academic department that offers the course you apply to will assess the academic quality and suitability of your application. After this is complete, the department will send you formal notification of their decision by email.Transfers and applying whilst studying at another UniversityOxford University does not normally accept transfer students. If you wish to follow an undergraduate course or graduate taught course at Oxford, you would need to start the course from the beginning and follow the normal applications process for the course. The arrangements for student course transfers details the process by which a current student, either at Oxford or at another institution, moves from one course to another, or from one mode of study to another.Students already in receipt of an undergraduate degree, and wishing to study a further undergraduate degree may apply for ‘senior status’ at Oxford, allowing them to be admitted directly to the Final Honour School for the degree. Students should follow the normal applications process for the course selecting Year 2 as their point of entry.Postgraduate research (PGR) students will only be considered for transfer to Oxford from another institution as a result of their main supervisor relocating to Oxford to take up an academic position. Students wishing to transfer are required to complete a graduate application form. An application to Education Committee is also required to permit work undertaken and time spent at the previous institution to count towards the requirements for the relevant award (‘antedated admission’). Permission may also be requested from Education Committee to waive transfer of status requirements, if appropriate. All applications must have the support of the relevant department and of a college willing to take the student.Written records of previous educationThe University retains a written record of students’ previous qualifications and Oxford academic history within the student system in accordance with the Student Privacy Policy. Your rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 2018 are outlined on the University's Data protection page.\nEmploymentAny employment during study must adhere to the University's Paid work guidelines.

Grant levels vary.\nUS Department of Veterans Affairs fundingThe University is currently able to process applications for US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) funding (also known as the GI Bill or Post 9/11 Bill) and can complete and submit certificates of enrolment to the VA. The University can certify enrolment for most degree-bearing courses which are matriculated, i.e. you are a full member of the University. Please be aware that it can take a long time to receive VA funding so you should not rely on VA benefits to fund a course deposit, or fees and living expenses early on in your course.Am I eligible?Before you start, please read the information about using VA benefits at foreign schools on the VA's website.The VA’s eligibility requirements are different for foreign schools, compared with those in the US. In order to use your VA benefits at Oxford, you must meet the same basic eligibility requirements for studying in the US and:be enrolled on an eligible, degree-bearing courseundertake your studies in OxfordNon-degree-bearing courses, such as undergraduate and graduate certificates and diplomas are not eligible. Courses involving online study or distance learning are also ineligible.If you are unsure whether your course is eligible for VA benefits at Oxford, please get in touch with the US Loans team.How to applyStep 1 - In order to apply for VA funding at Oxford you must first make an application directly to the VA once you have received an offer of a place to study on your chosen course. Please visit the US Department of Veterans Affairs website and consult their information for foreign schools. We recommend that you check the current benefit rates to get an idea of the benefits you might be eligible for at Oxford.Once you have applied, the VA will send you a Certificate of Eligibility.Step 2 – Email the US loans team with a copy of your Certificate of Eligibility. Step 3 - Complete our VA funding form to ensure we have the information we need to certify your enrolment to the VA.Step 4 – If your course has not yet been approved by the VA, the University will submit a request to the VA on your behalf. You can check whether your course has been approved using the VA's GI Bill Comparison Tool. Please be aware that it can take several months to receive a response to course approval requests. If your course is not yet approved, please complete the above steps as soon as possible to minimise delays to any funding you are eligible to receive.Step 5 – Once you have enrolled on your course, the US loans team will certify your enrolment to the VA.Step 6 – If you are eligible to receive a Monthly Housing Allowance (MHA), the VA requires that you verify your enrolment each month to confirm that you remain enrolled on the same course. Information on how to do this can be found on the Enrollment Verification page of the VA’s website.How much will I receive?The VA do not share their calculations with us so we cannot predict how much you will receive. You should be able to get a good idea by checking the current benefit rates, but please be aware that the amount you will receive depends on your individual benefit entitlement and enrolment details. If you are eligible for education benefits under the Post-9/11 GI Bill, you should be aware that tuition benefits at foreign schools are capped at $29,920.95 per year (in 2025-26). Depending on your benefit entitlement and course fees, the VA will pay the University up to this capped amount. If your annual course fee exceeds this amount, you will be responsible for paying the difference.You may also be eligible to receive a Monthly Housing Allowance (MHA) and book stipend. The amount you will receive depends on your benefit entitlement and whether you are enrolled full time or part time. Most part time courses at Oxford are half time or less and therefore you will not usually be eligible to receive MHA if you are studying part time.Receiving VA fundingIf your course is already approved by the VA, the University generally expects to receive the funds around 4-5 weeks after certifying your enrolment. The funds will be paid to the University and transferred to the relevant college or department for the payment of fees. Any remainder will be remitted to you.You may consider using other funding, such as a US federal or private education loan to cover the financial declaration and expenses early on in your course, and then use the VA funding to repay the loan when it arrives.Edith Nourse Rogers STEM ScholarshipVA also offers the Edith Nourse Rogers STEM Scholarship for students training in high demand STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) fields.Recipients will receive up to nine months of additional Post-9/11 GI Bill entitlement or a maximum of $30,000. Eligible Post-9/11 GI Bill students must have either exhausted their entitlement or will exhaust their entitlement within 180 days. For additional information, please visit the Rogers STEM Scholarship website.Prior Credit Review Policy for US Department of Veterans Affairs BeneficiariesThe US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) requires schools to review prior credit, experience, and training, and grant credit as appropriate towards a VA student’s current programme. This policy applies to new students, students transferring from another institution to the University of Oxford, and current students transferring programmes within the University of Oxford.Please contact the US loans team if you have any questions about the information given below.Entry requirementsAdmissions policies and procedures apply to new students. The links below provide an overview of the University of Oxford's general admissions policies and procedures:Undergraduate AdmissionsGraduate AdmissionsContinuing EducationIn order to take up the offer of a place to study at Oxford, all applicants must meet the qualification requirements of their course. Students should check the course page for individual programme admission requirements. If your qualifications are not from the UK, please also refer to the information on international qualifications for undergraduates and international qualifications for graduate students for guidance on the grades and qualifications that are considered equivalent to the University’s minimum entry requirements.Providing evidence of prior creditUndergraduate applicants must provide details about their education as part of their UCAS application. Applicants must list all qualifications along with the grades that have already been achieved and any standardised test scores. Applicants also need to list any educational qualifications that they are currently working towards. Those applying for a second undergraduate degree will need to send a transcript from their first degree separately to the college that is considering their application. For full information, please refer to the undergraduate guide for applicants.Graduate applicants should provide details of all qualifications and periods of study undertaken at university level, including qualifications that have not yet been completed, on the ‘Qualifications’ tab of the graduate application form. Non-UK qualifications do not need to be converted to UK degree classification, and an official statement of comparability from UK ENIC is not required. For each qualification entered, an official transcript should be uploaded. For full information, please refer to the graduate application guide.Prior Credit Review ProcessUndergraduate applications are assessed by academic tutors, usually from a college. Tutors make decisions based on all aspects of your application, including your interview, any admissions tests or written work required for your course, your prior academic attainment and predicted grades, your personal statement, the academic reference.Graduate applications are academically assessed against the entry requirements for the course and relatively in terms of the quality of previous academic excellence and future potential in comparison with the applications received from other candidates for that course. The academic department that offers the course you apply to will assess the academic quality and suitability of your application. After this is complete, the department will send you formal notification of their decision by email.Transfers and applying whilst studying at another UniversityOxford University does not normally accept transfer students. If you wish to follow an undergraduate course or graduate taught course at Oxford, you would need to start the course from the beginning and follow the normal applications process for the course. The arrangements for student course transfers details the process by which a current student, either at Oxford or at another institution, moves from one course to another, or from one mode of study to another.Students already in receipt of an undergraduate degree, and wishing to study a further undergraduate degree may apply for ‘senior status’ at Oxford, allowing them to be admitted directly to the Final Honour School for the degree. Students should follow the normal applications process for the course selecting Year 2 as their point of entry.Postgraduate research (PGR) students will only be considered for transfer to Oxford from another institution as a result of their main supervisor relocating to Oxford to take up an academic position. Students wishing to transfer are required to complete a graduate application form. An application to Education Committee is also required to permit work undertaken and time spent at the previous institution to count towards the requirements for the relevant award (‘antedated admission’). Permission may also be requested from Education Committee to waive transfer of status requirements, if appropriate. All applications must have the support of the relevant department and of a college willing to take the student.Written records of previous educationThe University retains a written record of students’ previous qualifications and Oxford academic history within the student system in accordance with the Student Privacy Policy. Your rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 2018 are outlined on the University's Data protection page.\nEmploymentAny employment during study must adhere to the University's Paid work guidelines. Within these guidelines, the following may be possible:Teaching opportunities: departments and colleges are sometimes able to offer teaching work. Some departments have graduate teaching schemes in place; please contact your department or faculty for more information.Demonstrator opportunities: in the experimental sciences, demonstrators are sometimes required for practical classes.Research Assistantships: these roles are sometimes available in departments and faculties.Junior Deans: these positions involve providing pastoral care to other students and being on-call day and night several times a week. Junior Deans normally receive free college accommodation, free meals and a small stipend. These positions are normally advertised on college websites and the college vacancies section of the Conference of Colleges website.Ad-hoc work can sometimes be found by advertising your skills locally as a tutor, translator or proof-reader. Part-time or seasonal work for the University and colleges may also be available, for example, invigilating examinations, administrative work or working in one of Oxford’s many libraries.A good source of part-time and temporary vacancies in Oxford is the Career Service’s online resource, CareerConnect. There are also several local job websites that provide details of vacancies in Oxford.Other possibilitiesIf you have recent work experience, it may be worth contacting one of your past or present employers to find out whether they would be able to offer you support. You could also consider approaching a potential employer of the future. Investigate companies or organisations working in your research area, particularly those with corporate social responsibility (CSR) aims and target them.Think creatively and strategically about other bodies you may be able to proactively approach for funding. They might not necessarily advertise scholarships or bursaries, but could you make a convincing case for them to support you? Are there any foundations in your local or home community that would be willing to support you?When approaching an employer or other potential funding body, make sure you consider:your initial approach, especially if the organisation does not appear to provide support for graduate students, needs to be concise, memorable and tailored to the needs and aims of the body you are contacting;taking the time to get a contact name in the organisation rather than sending a generic, open letter to the CEO;enclosing a short version of your research proposal or statement of purpose, remembering that you may need to make it more user-friendly for non-specialists;being specific - how much funding do you need? Could any of this come from in-kind support (equipment/use of research facilities/work experience etc), and what will you use the funds for?In addition to the above, think about what you can offer a potential sponsor. Could you undertake some research for them, give them free publicity, give a lecture/presentation, write a report etc?\nExternal scholarshipsA summary of external scholarships and search facilities is provided below.

Grant levels vary.\nUS Department of Veterans Affairs fundingThe University is currently able to process applications for US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) funding (also known as the GI Bill or Post 9/11 Bill) and can complete and submit certificates of enrolment to the VA. The University can certify enrolment for most degree-bearing courses which are matriculated, i.e. you are a full member of the University. Please be aware that it can take a long time to receive VA funding so you should not rely on VA benefits to fund a course deposit, or fees and living expenses early on in your course.Am I eligible?Before you start, please read the information about using VA benefits at foreign schools on the VA's website.The VA’s eligibility requirements are different for foreign schools, compared with those in the US. In order to use your VA benefits at Oxford, you must meet the same basic eligibility requirements for studying in the US and:be enrolled on an eligible, degree-bearing courseundertake your studies in OxfordNon-degree-bearing courses, such as undergraduate and graduate certificates and diplomas are not eligible. Courses involving online study or distance learning are also ineligible.If you are unsure whether your course is eligible for VA benefits at Oxford, please get in touch with the US Loans team.How to applyStep 1 - In order to apply for VA funding at Oxford you must first make an application directly to the VA once you have received an offer of a place to study on your chosen course. Please visit the US Department of Veterans Affairs website and consult their information for foreign schools. We recommend that you check the current benefit rates to get an idea of the benefits you might be eligible for at Oxford.Once you have applied, the VA will send you a Certificate of Eligibility.Step 2 – Email the US loans team with a copy of your Certificate of Eligibility. Step 3 - Complete our VA funding form to ensure we have the information we need to certify your enrolment to the VA.Step 4 – If your course has not yet been approved by the VA, the University will submit a request to the VA on your behalf. You can check whether your course has been approved using the VA's GI Bill Comparison Tool. Please be aware that it can take several months to receive a response to course approval requests. If your course is not yet approved, please complete the above steps as soon as possible to minimise delays to any funding you are eligible to receive.Step 5 – Once you have enrolled on your course, the US loans team will certify your enrolment to the VA.Step 6 – If you are eligible to receive a Monthly Housing Allowance (MHA), the VA requires that you verify your enrolment each month to confirm that you remain enrolled on the same course. Information on how to do this can be found on the Enrollment Verification page of the VA’s website.How much will I receive?The VA do not share their calculations with us so we cannot predict how much you will receive. You should be able to get a good idea by checking the current benefit rates, but please be aware that the amount you will receive depends on your individual benefit entitlement and enrolment details. If you are eligible for education benefits under the Post-9/11 GI Bill, you should be aware that tuition benefits at foreign schools are capped at $29,920.95 per year (in 2025-26). Depending on your benefit entitlement and course fees, the VA will pay the University up to this capped amount. If your annual course fee exceeds this amount, you will be responsible for paying the difference.You may also be eligible to receive a Monthly Housing Allowance (MHA) and book stipend. The amount you will receive depends on your benefit entitlement and whether you are enrolled full time or part time. Most part time courses at Oxford are half time or less and therefore you will not usually be eligible to receive MHA if you are studying part time.Receiving VA fundingIf your course is already approved by the VA, the University generally expects to receive the funds around 4-5 weeks after certifying your enrolment. The funds will be paid to the University and transferred to the relevant college or department for the payment of fees. Any remainder will be remitted to you.You may consider using other funding, such as a US federal or private education loan to cover the financial declaration and expenses early on in your course, and then use the VA funding to repay the loan when it arrives.Edith Nourse Rogers STEM ScholarshipVA also offers the Edith Nourse Rogers STEM Scholarship for students training in high demand STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) fields.Recipients will receive up to nine months of additional Post-9/11 GI Bill entitlement or a maximum of $30,000. Eligible Post-9/11 GI Bill students must have either exhausted their entitlement or will exhaust their entitlement within 180 days. For additional information, please visit the Rogers STEM Scholarship website.Prior Credit Review Policy for US Department of Veterans Affairs BeneficiariesThe US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) requires schools to review prior credit, experience, and training, and grant credit as appropriate towards a VA student’s current programme. This policy applies to new students, students transferring from another institution to the University of Oxford, and current students transferring programmes within the University of Oxford.Please contact the US loans team if you have any questions about the information given below.Entry requirementsAdmissions policies and procedures apply to new students. The links below provide an overview of the University of Oxford's general admissions policies and procedures:Undergraduate AdmissionsGraduate AdmissionsContinuing EducationIn order to take up the offer of a place to study at Oxford, all applicants must meet the qualification requirements of their course. Students should check the course page for individual programme admission requirements. If your qualifications are not from the UK, please also refer to the information on international qualifications for undergraduates and international qualifications for graduate students for guidance on the grades and qualifications that are considered equivalent to the University’s minimum entry requirements.Providing evidence of prior creditUndergraduate applicants must provide details about their education as part of their UCAS application. Applicants must list all qualifications along with the grades that have already been achieved and any standardised test scores. Applicants also need to list any educational qualifications that they are currently working towards. Those applying for a second undergraduate degree will need to send a transcript from their first degree separately to the college that is considering their application. For full information, please refer to the undergraduate guide for applicants.Graduate applicants should provide details of all qualifications and periods of study undertaken at university level, including qualifications that have not yet been completed, on the ‘Qualifications’ tab of the graduate application form. Non-UK qualifications do not need to be converted to UK degree classification, and an official statement of comparability from UK ENIC is not required. For each qualification entered, an official transcript should be uploaded. For full information, please refer to the graduate application guide.Prior Credit Review ProcessUndergraduate applications are assessed by academic tutors, usually from a college. Tutors make decisions based on all aspects of your application, including your interview, any admissions tests or written work required for your course, your prior academic attainment and predicted grades, your personal statement, the academic reference.Graduate applications are academically assessed against the entry requirements for the course and relatively in terms of the quality of previous academic excellence and future potential in comparison with the applications received from other candidates for that course. The academic department that offers the course you apply to will assess the academic quality and suitability of your application. After this is complete, the department will send you formal notification of their decision by email.Transfers and applying whilst studying at another UniversityOxford University does not normally accept transfer students. If you wish to follow an undergraduate course or graduate taught course at Oxford, you would need to start the course from the beginning and follow the normal applications process for the course. The arrangements for student course transfers details the process by which a current student, either at Oxford or at another institution, moves from one course to another, or from one mode of study to another.Students already in receipt of an undergraduate degree, and wishing to study a further undergraduate degree may apply for ‘senior status’ at Oxford, allowing them to be admitted directly to the Final Honour School for the degree. Students should follow the normal applications process for the course selecting Year 2 as their point of entry.Postgraduate research (PGR) students will only be considered for transfer to Oxford from another institution as a result of their main supervisor relocating to Oxford to take up an academic position. Students wishing to transfer are required to complete a graduate application form. An application to Education Committee is also required to permit work undertaken and time spent at the previous institution to count towards the requirements for the relevant award (‘antedated admission’). Permission may also be requested from Education Committee to waive transfer of status requirements, if appropriate. All applications must have the support of the relevant department and of a college willing to take the student.Written records of previous educationThe University retains a written record of students’ previous qualifications and Oxford academic history within the student system in accordance with the Student Privacy Policy. Your rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 2018 are outlined on the University's Data protection page.\nEmploymentAny employment during study must adhere to the University's Paid work guidelines. Within these guidelines, the following may be possible:Teaching opportunities: departments and colleges are sometimes able to offer teaching work. Some departments have graduate teaching schemes in place; please contact your department or faculty for more information.Demonstrator opportunities: in the experimental sciences, demonstrators are sometimes required for practical classes.Research Assistantships: these roles are sometimes available in departments and faculties.Junior Deans: these positions involve providing pastoral care to other students and being on-call day and night several times a week. Junior Deans normally receive free college accommodation, free meals and a small stipend. These positions are normally advertised on college websites and the college vacancies section of the Conference of Colleges website.Ad-hoc work can sometimes be found by advertising your skills locally as a tutor, translator or proof-reader. Part-time or seasonal work for the University and colleges may also be available, for example, invigilating examinations, administrative work or working in one of Oxford’s many libraries.A good source of part-time and temporary vacancies in Oxford is the Career Service’s online resource, CareerConnect. There are also several local job websites that provide details of vacancies in Oxford.Other possibilitiesIf you have recent work experience, it may be worth contacting one of your past or present employers to find out whether they would be able to offer you support. You could also consider approaching a potential employer of the future. Investigate companies or organisations working in your research area, particularly those with corporate social responsibility (CSR) aims and target them.Think creatively and strategically about other bodies you may be able to proactively approach for funding. They might not necessarily advertise scholarships or bursaries, but could you make a convincing case for them to support you? Are there any foundations in your local or home community that would be willing to support you?When approaching an employer or other potential funding body, make sure you consider:your initial approach, especially if the organisation does not appear to provide support for graduate students, needs to be concise, memorable and tailored to the needs and aims of the body you are contacting;taking the time to get a contact name in the organisation rather than sending a generic, open letter to the CEO;enclosing a short version of your research proposal or statement of purpose, remembering that you may need to make it more user-friendly for non-specialists;being specific - how much funding do you need? Could any of this come from in-kind support (equipment/use of research facilities/work experience etc), and what will you use the funds for?In addition to the above, think about what you can offer a potential sponsor. Could you undertake some research for them, give them free publicity, give a lecture/presentation, write a report etc?\nWas this page useful?* \n Yes \n\n\n No\nPlease tell us what you want to see on this page, the more specific you can be the more likely it is that we can add it.\nCan't find what you're looking for?If you have a query about graduate admissions at Oxford, we're here to help:Ask a question\n\n\nPrivacy PolicyPostgraduate Applicant Privacy Policy\n[GRID_TABLE]\nA view down Brasenose Lane towards the Radcliffe Camera\n(Image Credit: Mike Navarrete / Graduate Photography Competition)\n[GRID_TABLE]\nAlongside Oxford funding, there are many other funding options available.

Are there any foundations in your local or home community that would be willing to support you?When approaching an employer or other potential funding body, make sure you consider:your initial approach, especially if the organisation does not appear to provide support for graduate students, needs to be concise, memorable and tailored to the needs and aims of the body you are contacting;taking the time to get a contact name in the organisation rather than sending a generic, open letter to the CEO;enclosing a short version of your research proposal or statement of purpose, remembering that you may need to make it more user-friendly for non-specialists;being specific - how much funding do you need? Could any of this come from in-kind support (equipment/use of research facilities/work experience etc), and what will you use the funds for?In addition to the above, think about what you can offer a potential sponsor. Could you undertake some research for them, give them free publicity, give a lecture/presentation, write a report etc?",

      "content": "[HEADING] Share This\n[HEADING] Where can I find information about how to apply?\n[HEADING] Where do our students come from?\n[HEADING] Start the evaluation\n[HEADING] Privacy Policy\n[HEADING] Share This\nThis self-evaluation tool is designed to help you understand whether you are likely to be able to make a competitive application to a graduate course at Oxford and provide helpful advice on how to make the strongest possible application.\nAll the information you need to apply is available on this website, so make sure you have noted when you need to apply, what your application should contain and how it will be evaluated.\nApplications will be assessed according to the entry requirements listed on individual course pages and the information you provide, so make sure you have checked the specifications for the supporting documents in the How to apply section of the course page (these will differ for each course).\nThere aren’t any hidden rules or requirements – applications are assessed against defined criteria and decisions made accordingly.\nOur graduate students come from all round the world and a diverse range of backgrounds.\nOxford is committed to supporting applications from disadvantaged and underrepresented groups and has a range of graduate access schemes in place.\nOur courses fall into two categories: taught courses (MSt, MSc, MPhil, PGDip, PGCert) and research courses (DPhil and MSc by Research).\nQuestion: What type of course are you considering applying to?\nYour answer: A taught course\nYour answer: A research course\nReturn to start\nTaught course Research course\nPostgraduate taught courses include various levels of course: postgraduate certificates and diplomas, MSc and MSt masters' courses and MPhils.\nFull-time masters’ courses are one-year courses, while MPhil courses last two years, with the first year normally being taught and the second research.\nSome taught courses will encourage or require you to contact a potential supervisor ahead of applying. You can find information on this in the How to apply section of individual course pages. If you need to contact a supervisor, please refer to advice on the course page.\nYour answer: Proceed\nReturn to start\nPostgraduate research courses are typically either at PhD (known at Oxford as DPhil) or masters' level. An MSc by Research course is like a mini PhD and has no taught components. A full-time DPhil typically takes 3-4 years, while an MSc by Research takes 1-3 years.\nSome DPhil courses will require you to have completed a masters' course first – you can find information on this in the entry requirements section of the course page.\nResearch courses will typically require you to submit a research proposal as part of your application and you are often required to contact a potential supervisor ahead of applying. You can find information on this in the How to apply section of individual course pages. If you need to contact a supervisor, please refer to advice on the course page.\nYour answer: Proceed\nReturn to start\nEntry requirements for each course are set out on our individual course pages. These are what the academic assessors will be considering when making their decision. Since entry to our courses is highly competitive, you are likely to need to meet, or even exceed, the published entry requirements. Assessors will also consider how your performance has changed over time - your academic trajectory.\nAcademic grades are only one part of the assessment, so there may be some flexibility depending on other elements of your application and extenuating circumstances that may have affected your academic performance.\nAssessors will also typically be looking for evidence of a deep interest in the subject area you have chosen, evidence of which might take the form of events attended, presentations and publications, practical experience, reading around the subject and a compelling explanation of how the course will help you achieve your ambitions.\nSome courses hold interviews after shortlisting applicants, while others make their decisions based solely on the application and supporting documents, including references – this will be indicated in the entry requirements.\nYour answer: Proceed\nReturn to start\nThe minimum qualification normally required to be able to make a competitive application is shown on our individual course pages.

Since entry to our courses is highly competitive, you are likely to need to meet, or even exceed, the published entry requirements. Assessors will also consider how your performance has changed over time - your academic trajectory.Academic grades are only one part of the assessment, so there may be some flexibility depending on other elements of your application and extenuating circumstances that may have affected your academic performance.Assessors will also typically be looking for evidence of a deep interest in the subject area you have chosen, evidence of which might take the form of events attended, presentations and publications, practical experience, reading around the subject and a compelling explanation of how the course will help you achieve your ambitions.Some courses hold interviews after shortlisting applicants, while others make their decisions based solely on the application and supporting documents, including references – this will be indicated in the entry requirements.Your answer: ProceedReturn to startProceedThe minimum qualification normally required to be able to make a competitive application is shown on our individual course pages. This is expressed either using the UK scale (1st, 2.1, 2.2, 3) or a US GPA (out of 4.0).At the point of application we will accept a download or screenshot of your transcript from a self-service system, as long as it contains details of the institution, course, grades and your name.If you are still completing your current course, you will need to provide an interim transcript showing the grades you have achieved so far.Question: Do you meet (or are expecting to meet) the published requirements?Your answer: YesYour answer: NoYour answer: My qualifications use a different grading systemReturn to startYes No My qualifications use a different systemThe University publishes guidance on international qualifications from 28 countries to help applicants understand the types of qualifications and grades that would be considered to meet the entry requirements.If you are unsure about the suitability of your qualifications after checking this guidance, please contact the course administrator for guidance using the contact details on our individual course pages.Question: Do your overseas qualifications meet the published requirements?Your answer: YesYour answer: NoYour answer: My country is not coveredReturn to startYes No My country is not coveredIf your qualifications are not covered by our international qualifications guidance, our assessors will evaluate them as part of assessing your application. As well as local knowledge, assessors will use information published by the UK’s qualifications body, ECCTIS.Since entry to our courses is highly competitive, your grades would normally need to place you near the top of your cohort in your previous course. 20-25% of graduate applications to Oxford receive offers, although this does vary significantly by course – you can find information about volumes of applications received and places available on the right of each course page .You do not need to provide information about your cohort ranking – this will be determined from your transcripts and the ratings given by your referees.Question: Are/were your academic grades near the top of your cohort?Your answer: YesYour answer: NoReturn to startYes NoSome of our courses include a significant professional element; this will be outlined on the course page.If you are applying for one of these courses and your undergraduate degree does not meet the course’s requirement, your professional experience may enable you to make a competitive application.If you need further advice, please contact the course administrator via the contact details on the course page.Question: Are you applying for a course that has a significant professional element and have at least 3 years of relevant professional experience? Your answer: YesYour answer: NoReturn to startYes NoYou may be able to make a successful application without meeting the entry requirements if specific circumstances have affected the strength of your application.You can follow the instructions in the Application Guide to submit details of these extenuating circumstances in the extenuating circumstances section of your application, as well as in your personal statement if your course requires one.Academic assessors will consider whether to adjust their assessment based on these circumstances.Examples of potentially relevant circumstances include:ill health;lack of access to opportunities (eg due to the coronavirus pandemic);significant caring responsibilities;being care experienced or homeless; andbeing a displaced person or refugee.It will help our academic assessors if you provide evidence that focuses on the impact of those circumstances (eg effect on grades during a specific period or loss of opportunities such as an internship).You should not include circumstances that have been appropriately addressed by your previous institution.Question: Are there significant extenuating circumstances not taken into account by your institution that have affected your performance or disadvantages you have experienced in your school education? Your answer: YesYour answer: NoReturn to startYes NoN/AYour answer: YesYour answer: NoReturn to startYes NoN/AYour answer: YesYour answer: NoReturn to startYes NoBased on the responses you have made, you are likely to be in a position to make a competitive application. Successful candidates often have higher scores than the minimum indicated, but applications are assessed according to the full set of entry requirements, not just academic grades and will take account of your academic trajectory as well as any extenuating circumstances.To give yourself the best possible chance of success, make sure you check the How to apply section of the course page to ensure you submit the correct documents and they meet the specifications.Start your application in good time (typically at least two months before the deadline to which you are applying) and register your referees as soon as you can.Aim to submit your application at least two weeks ahead of the deadline so that you will be notified before the deadline if anything is missing.Check the How to apply section of each course page to ensure you submit the correct documents and they meet the specifications.You can find information about funding your studies in the  Fees and Funding section of this website.Almost all University funding will require you to have applied in time for the December or January application deadline used by your course – check individual course pages for deadlines used.You’ll automatically be considered for most funding that you’re eligible for, but please use the Fees, Funding and Scholarship search tool for details of whether any additional materials are required for particular schemes.You may be able to make a competitive application. Our assessors will examine your qualifications to determine whether your qualifications and grades meet the entry requirements for the course.Professional experience may also be taken into account where this is mentioned in the entry requirements section of the course page.Entry to our courses is highly competitive, but the University is committed to supporting applications from disadvantaged and underrepresented groups and has a range of graduate access schemes in place. Our academic assessors will determine whether any adjustments should be made to their assessment based on any extenuating circumstances and will consider your academic trajectory and evidence of potential in their decision.Aim to submit your application at least two weeks ahead of the deadline so that you will be notified before the deadline if anything is missing.Check the How to apply section of each course page to ensure you submit the correct documents and they meet the specifications.You can find information about funding your studies in the  Fees and Funding section of this website.Almost all University funding will require you to have applied in time for the December or January application deadline used by your course – check individual course pages for deadlines used.You’ll automatically be considered for most funding that you’re eligible for, but please use the Fees, Funding and Scholarship search tool for details of whether any additional materials are required for particular scheme.You may be able to make a competitive application.

If a year abroad, or other placement, has to be cancelled entirely then this includes moving a student to an appropriate degree course that does not include the time abroad or placement.Subject to this Policy, and to the Student Terms and Conditions, no refunds, discounts, damages or waivers of course fees or other charges will be payable to you where changes or delays have resulted from, been caused by, or are in relation to a pandemic, epidemic or local health emergency necessitating measures to reduce risk of infection or illness.SupervisionSupervisory allocations for students may change during the course of study for reasons which might include illness, sabbatical leave, maternity leave, change in employment or other changes connected to a pandemic, epidemic or local health emergency. If this occurs the department will be responsible for ensuring that a new supervisor is appointed as soon as possible (either on a temporary or permanent basis) and the student will be kept informed as soon as reasonably possible.\nCOVID-19At the time this Policy was last updated (Michaelmas 2024) the University, in line with national guidance, is providing in-person teaching and access to services, and is not requiring measures, or making changes, as a result of COVID-19. However, if renewed measures need to be taken in future to reduce risk of infection from COVID-19 (eg as a result of a new disease variant, a rise in cases and/or reintroduction of national restrictions) then COVID-19 would then be treated as a pandemic under the provisions of this Policy and the Student Terms and Conditions.DefinitionsDefinitions of some terms used above:'Local Health Emergency' includes, but is not limited to: (a) a threat to health which is not infective in nature (eg radiation or poisoning); or (b) an outbreak of infective illness which has not yet been classed as an epidemic or pandemic because cases are confined to a part of the UK (including Oxford).Full Term means the University’s dates for Michaelmas (Autumn), Hilary (Spring) and Trinity (Summer) terms which are advertised in the Oxford Gazette.A HSI sets out standards of behaviour required of students during any pandemic, epidemic or local health emergency. ‘HSI’ includes any University code, policy or guidance issued in such circumstances. If a HSI is in force students must comply with it as a condition of in-person access to teaching and facilities, and may be disciplined for non-compliance.\nWas this page useful?* \n Yes \n\n\n No\nPlease tell us what you want to see on this page, the more specific you can be the more likely it is that we can add it.\nSee also\n\nChanges to fees and charges\nUniversity policies\n\n\n\n\n\nCan't find what you're looking for?If you have a query about graduate admissions at Oxford, we're here to help:Ask a question\n\n\nPrivacy PolicyPostgraduate Applicant Privacy Policy\nChanges to fees and charges\nUniversity policies\nChanges to fees and charges\nUniversity policies\n[GRID_TABLE]\nOxford Castle motte\n\n\n(Image credit: Henry Lee / Graduate Photography Competition)\nOxford Castle motte\n\n\n(Image credit: Henry Lee / Graduate Photography Competition)\nOxford Castle motte\n(Image credit: Henry Lee / Graduate Photography Competition)\nThe Graduate Admissions pages of the University of Oxford website are designed for those applying for graduate study at the University of Oxford during the 2024-25 academic year.\n\n\nThe University will seek to deliver each course in accordance with the description set out in the Course Information Sheet sent to applicants with their offer of a place. Course webpages at the A-Z of courses page give further details.However, there may be situations in which it is desirable or necessary for the University to make changes in course provision, either before or after you commence your course. There are two main scenarios in which such changes might happen:Normal circumstances (where there is no pandemic, epidemic or local health emergency); andCircumstances where a pandemic, epidemic or local health emergency arises, or has arisen. (‘Local health emergency’ is defined at the end of this document)This policy should be read together with the Student Terms and Conditions. The provision of course options which depend on the availability of specialist teaching, or on placement at another institution, cannot be guaranteed in advance.Changes to courses in normal circumstancesWhere desirable or necessary changes are to be made, the University will offer, where possible, appropriate and alternative options for affected students. If you do not wish to accept any alternative arrangements then you will have the opportunity to withdraw from your course.The University will not make very substantial changes to courses (for example, a change to the course title, significant restructuring, substantial change in course content, or the introduction of a progression hurdle) which would impact on you once you have started your course. In exceptional circumstances the University may need to make such a change after you have accepted your place. This will not normally happen less than 3 months before the first day of the Full Term in which you start your course. In exceptional circumstances we may need to suspend, discontinue or combine courses. This may be because of academic changes within subject areas, or as a result of low student numbers on a course.Other changes could be made to course content, delivery and teaching provision because of developments in the relevant subject, enhancements in teaching or assessment practice, requirements of external accreditation processes, changes in staffing, resource constraints or changes in the availability of facilities. Such changes will take account of the reasonable expectations of prospective and current students.Once you have accepted your Offer, you will be notified of any material change made before you start your course (as compared to the description in your Course Information Sheet) and you will be offered the opportunity to withdraw from the course.On-course students will be consulted about any proposed material course change (except changes which are solely for their benefit) which would affect the part of the course which they have already started studying.Changes to courses because of a pandemic, epidemic or local health emergencyWhere a pandemic, epidemic or local health emergency necessitating measures to reduce risk of infection or illness arises the University may make reasonable changes to comply with government or local authority regulations or guidance, and/or its own health and safety advice and/or to ensure the health and safety of staff, students and third parties and/or to respond to consequential staffing or resource constraints.
