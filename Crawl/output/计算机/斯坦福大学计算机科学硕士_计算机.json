What really impresses me is the conviction and drive of people here. They really care about the topics they work on. They want to bring value to people and they want to have an impact: to do good for humanity. It’s something very unique to Stanford. The speed at which you can exchange ideas was totally new to me when I came here and I love it.\"\nAlumni Spotlight: Kayla Patterson, MS ’24 Computer Science\n\"I study human-computer interaction (HCI), because I want to understand how to think about people when it comes to developing technology. I’ve taken classes with James Landay, Michael Bernstein, and Christina Wodtke, and they just blew my mind with HCI.\"Meet recent graduate, Kayla Patterson, as she contemplates a new chapter in life\nOur main educational goal is to prepare students for a rapidly changing world. Undergraduate students have the option of declaring a Bachelor of Science or a Minor in Computer Science. Graduate students have the opportunity to pursue a Master's or PhD degree in Computer Science. The Master's degree is a terminal professional degree. The PhD is for those who desire a research or teaching career.\nStanford Computer Science cultivates an expansive range of research opportunities and a renowned group of faculty. Here, discoveries that impact the world spring from the diverse perspectives and life experiences of our community of students, faculty, and staff.\nThe CS Department is a center for research and education, discovering new frontiers in AI, robotics, scientific computing and more.\nMore About CS Research\nStanford CS faculty members strive to solve the world's most pressing problems, working in conjunction with other leaders across multiple fields.\nExplore Faculty by Their Areas of Research\nEveryone deserves a voice in the discovery of new technology and the shaping of innovation. Stanford CS is nurturing a future in science that represents all cultures and backgrounds.\nYang works on natural language processing, which combines math and theory to enable computers to communicate, through speech and text, in a human-like way. Specifically, she’s focused on making the technologies that power human-computer (and some human-human) communication more socially responsible.\nRead Assistant Professor Diyi Yang’s full interview\nA computer scientist bringing AI to the classroom and the gym looks ahead to a world where AI coaches help make us smarter … and healthier. Join host Russ Altman on this episode of The Future of Everything Podcast and hear Professor James Landay share his thoughts on how AI is not just good at creating text and answering our questions, it can motivate us as a coach, and it can teach us as a tutor. It's the future of AI coaching.\nAfter many years of planning, fundraising, and development, the all-new Stanford Robotics Center officially opened its doors! “I came to Stanford in 1981 and this idea – this dream – was always there, even then,” says Oussama Khatib, director of the new Stanford Robotics Center and mastermind of the design and transformation of the space.\nSee the video and take a tour of the new facility, a bright, open, and vibrant space .\nMeet some of the students, faculty, and alumni who create the Stanford Computer Science community.\n\"The communication skills that vocal performance has cultivated in me, understanding how to communicate an idea to another person and have a meaningful conversation that is really grounded in impact, has been life changing.\"\n\"I particularly care about machine learning applications in healthcare, energy, and climate change – uses that will not only save lives, but also improve the well-being of both people and the planet.\"\n\"I came to Stanford because it is among the strongest universities in my areas of interest: machine learning and AI. I’m interested in thinking about artificial intelligence in a rigorous way.\"\n- Christopher Hahn, Ph.DVisiting Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department at Stanford University and an Independent Research Group Leader at the CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security\n[GRID_TABLE]\nPreparing Our Students to Make Meaningful Contributions to the World\nPreparing Our Students to Make Meaningful Contributions to the World\nAlumni Spotlight: Kayla Patterson, MS ’24 Computer Science\"I study human-computer interaction (HCI), because I want to understand how to think about people when it comes to developing technology.
