This advancement results in an increased demand for individuals who can create complex systems that can partner with, rather than replace or even augment, human users.\nNorthwestern’s Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence (MSAI) program aims to serve this demand by producing graduates who have exceptional technical skills to create new AI systems and who also understand the nature of the human environments in which the systems they build will be deployed.\nNorthwestern Engineering’s Mohammed Alam shares his excitement for MSAI students on the courses they take that build their theoretical and practical skills in AI.\nProgram Director Kris Hammond discusses the importance of AI and how partnering with machines that gather data can give us access to the wealth of information the machines collect.\nAlumna Neelanshi Varia discusses how the MSAI program's curriculum and format of pure AI provides a full experience of knowledge exchange to prepare her for a robust career in AI.\nRequest InfoHow to Apply\nThe basics at-a-glance\nDegree earned: Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence\nNorthwestern University’s Evanston campus\nEasy access to Chicago’s STEM industries\nSee program overview\nMSAI (traditional track)\n15-months, full-time\nMSAI+X track\n12 months, full-time\nClasses held weekdays and begin in September (MSAI traditional) or June (MSAI+X)\nSee program schedule\nCohort of ~45 students\nMeet our students\nOur cohort fills quickly, but our application will remain open until all seats are filled.\n“\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe MS in Artificial Intelligence program at Northwestern is outstanding as this program is aimed to support many types of career trajectories in the artificial intelligence world: AI architect, machine learning engineer, or even data analysts.”\n“\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tComing to a company like Deloitte, or a company like McDonald's, you recognize the tech stack right away… MSAI set the groundwork for me”\n“\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMSAI has done an amazing job of teaching me how to best use the most powerful tools in Computer Science today.”\n“\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI have always been passionate about climate science and environmental sustainability. I was introduced to machine learning and national language processing and realized that I needed more formal skills. Northwestern had the best program to offer; 16 subjects in just 15 months, pure AI.”\n“\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMy cohort comes from a lot of different backgrounds. That brings a really interesting dynamic to the classroom.

If you have an argument for factors that we should or should not consider, please include it in your personal statement.\nIndividuals should have completed a BA/BS in Computer Science or in a related field.\nA strong preference will be given to applicants who have work experience (at least two years) in a related field, such as development, design, or software architecture.\nThe online application requires you to submit a scanned, unofficial copy of your transcript from each college or university that you have attended. Please make sure that the scanned transcripts are legible before uploading them. If you are offered a place in the MSAI program and you decide to enroll, you will be required to submit one official copy of each transcript. Official transcripts should be sent directly from the issuing institution's registrar either mailed to the address below in sealed, unopened envelopes or emailed to msai@northwestern.edu as official electronic transcripts.\nWe require three letters of recommendation from either faculty at a prospective student’s undergraduate institution, or from current employers/managers. If neither is available, applicants will need to provide a clear explanation why this is the case.\nGRE scores are an optional component of your application. If you choose to include your GRE scores, they will be considered.\nUnofficial scores should be self-reported in the online application, and scanned copies of the scores may be uploaded. If scans are uploaded, program staff will contact ETS and verify your scores (no need to send official scores). If scans are not provided in the online application, official scores should be sent to Northwestern University Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence. Our institution code is 2601. To help you prepare, you may access ETS GRE General Test preparation materials here.\nApplicants to the MSAI program whose primary language is not English must demonstrate language proficiency in one of the following four ways:\nYou must upload a current resume or CV in the online application.\nThe admissions team will review candidates for evidence of self-directed work in Computer Science such as shared code repositories (e.g., Github), open source publications, and developer’s forums such Stack Overflow. Applicants should provide URLs to accounts and/or repositories.\nThis is a critical part of your application, which gives you the opportunity to articulate your motivations, aptitude, and vision. In 500 words or less, address the following questions:\nThe candidate video is currently an optional upload, but we do recommend uploading a video to allow the admissions committee to get to know you as a candidate. Please limit your video to 2 minutes long, as the admissions committee will not watch beyond 2 minutes.\nPlease note that the Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence is a small cohort program; students will have the opportunity to work with each classmate over the course of four academic quarters in the program. With this in mind, please use your video to help the admissions committee get to know your personality, work style, and leadership capabilities.\nThemes to consider as you put together your video:\nRequirements for videos:\nReturn to Top\nNorthwestern University does not make decisions related to admissions, including but not limited to financial aid and scholarships, based upon any category protected by the law.
