This is the credo of our Master's program in Computer Science: Games Engineering. The course takes into account the growing influence of interactive computer game technologies on our society by establishing a new computer science course in the area of ​​tension between pioneering multidisciplinary basic research and the rapid development of a new technological field with high industrial innovation potential. The new master's degree program aims to provide in-depth scientific training in the field of game technologies, with a focus on the systematic research, development and expansion, technical implementation and research-oriented application of interactive technologies, for example in the areas of education, training, film and television.\nGames Engineering covers the theoretical foundations of interactive computer game technologies and their implementation with software, heterogeneous computer systems as well as multi-sensory interfaces and display systems. Modern games engineering combines fundamental concepts from computer science, physics and mathematics, taking hardware-specific aspects, user-friendliness and interaction capabilities into account. The master's program aims to equip students with the skills to design and implement the technical infrastructure of modern computer games, to test computer game technologies in new application contexts and ultimately to explore ways to integrate such technologies into research, development and our daily lives.\nType of Study: Full-time\nStandard Duration of Studies: 4 semesters\nCredits: 120 ECTS\nMain Locations: Garching\nStart of Degree Program: Summer or Winter semester\nLanguage of Instruction: English\nCosts: Semester fees, tuitions fees for Students from Non-EU Countries\nProfessional Profile: Informatics\nThe master's program in Computer Science: Games Engineering takes 4 semesters in total. In the first three semesters, in addition to the compulsory modules, the focus is on the content from the focus areas (\"lines of specialization\") you have chosen. As a student, you can put together your study plan flexibly and thus create an individual skills profile. Specialization lines offered are:\nThese are supplemented in the third semester by the master seminar, maste lab courses and optionally guided research. The fourth semester is dedicated to the Master’s thesis.\nThe master's program in Computer Science: Games Engineering is research-oriented. It broadens and deepens specialist knowledge, enables independent academic work, lays the foundation for the further development of the subject and prepares students for demanding professional work or a doctorate. It qualifies you in particular for independent and managerial activities and is characterized by scientific knowledge, promotion of independence, the ability to judge and make decisions and proximity to research.\nThe main goal is to complement the bachelor's degree in Computer Science: Games Engineering by continuing it to a complete university degree in Computer Science with a focus on Games Engineering, which has an appropriate professional breadth and depth. In addition, flexible deepening in at least two lines of specialization is required without reducing the qualification profile of a generalist in the field of interactive computer game technologies. The master's degree program gives students a high degree of freedom in designing their individual studies in order to enable them to get an early start in research-related and innovative practical subject areas.\nThe gaming market is booming. Therefore, there is a great need for qualified specialists in the field of “Informatics: Games Engineering” among all development studios. Under the catchphrase “Serious Games,” game concepts also increasingly find their way into economic sectors such as automobile, aircraft and plant engineering, medicine, banking and management. Computer Science: Games Engineering is an international subject. With a degree in Games Engineering, graduates can work and research worldwide in a variety of different application domains.\nThe Master of Informatics: Games Engineering builds on the Bachelor of Computer Science: Games Engineering. You should therefore have studied games engineering or a similar computer science-related course of study. The main goal is to broaden and deepen the bachelor's degree in terms of subject matter.\nWe carry out an aptitude test to select students for the Master's degree in Computer Science: Games Engineering.

At my university, we do not use credits at all. What should I do?\nWe assume that all courses are weighted equally. You can indicate one credit for each course. In this case, each course is of the same weight. The total number of credits then is the total number of courses that were part of your study program.\n2. At my university, we have a letter grade scheme. What should I do?\nFor the grade calculation, the Excel sheet does not acept letters, you have to indicate numbers. You can use one number for each letter, i.e. if your grade scheme is A+, A, B, C, D and E = Fail, you have A+=1, A=2, B=3, C=4 and D=5. The highest possible grade is 1, the lowest grade to pass the course is 4. If your grading scheme is A+, A, B+, B etc., you have A+=1, A=2, B+=3, B=4 etc.\n3. I have more than one degree. Can I indicate all courses and grades in the Excel sheet?\nIf you are applying for M.Sc. Robotics, Cognition and Intelligence, you can only specify courses and grades from a single Bachelor's program for the grade calculation. This must be the Bachelor's degree that qualifies for the Master's degree and that you have indicated in TUMonline as your entrance qualification for the Master's program. If you are applying for M.Sc. Information Systems or M.Sc. Informatics: Games Engineering, you can enter courses from more than one program in part 2 (matching your courses with courses at TUM), but only courses and grades from one program (the master's entrance qualification) in part 3 (calculating the grade). You have to prove all entered grades and credits by uploading a corresponding Transcript of Records of all courses.\n1. I have been admitted, but I have to postpone the start of my studies. Is that possible?\nYes, you can postpone the start of your studies.

At my university, we do not use credits at all. What should I do?\nWe assume that all courses are weighted equally. You can indicate one credit for each course. In this case, each course is of the same weight. The total number of credits then is the total number of courses that were part of your study program.\n2. At my university, we have a letter grade scheme. What should I do?\nFor the grade calculation, the Excel sheet does not acept letters, you have to indicate numbers. You can use one number for each letter, i.e. if your grade scheme is A+, A, B, C, D and E = Fail, you have A+=1, A=2, B=3, C=4 and D=5. The highest possible grade is 1, the lowest grade to pass the course is 4. If your grading scheme is A+, A, B+, B etc., you have A+=1, A=2, B+=3, B=4 etc.\n3. I have more than one degree. Can I indicate all courses and grades in the Excel sheet?\nIf you are applying for M.Sc. Robotics, Cognition and Intelligence, you can only specify courses and grades from a single Bachelor's program for the grade calculation. This must be the Bachelor's degree that qualifies for the Master's degree and that you have indicated in TUMonline as your entrance qualification for the Master's program. If you are applying for M.Sc. Information Systems or M.Sc. Informatics: Games Engineering, you can enter courses from more than one program in part 2 (matching your courses with courses at TUM), but only courses and grades from one program (the master's entrance qualification) in part 3 (calculating the grade). You have to prove all entered grades and credits by uploading a corresponding Transcript of Records of all courses.\nPostponing of the study start\n1. I have been admitted, but I have to postpone the start of my studies. Is that possible?\nYes, you can postpone the start of your studies. After reapplying (!) via TUMonline within the regular application periods, you can receive a new admission for the respective semester. The new application works as follows:\nYou enter a new application in TUMonline and upload an updated CV (!). The rest of the documents must also be uploaded again, but here you can use the same documents which you submitted for the first application. This means that you do not have to write a new essay and a new statement of reasons, but you can upload the documents from the first application again here.\nPlease make sure that you actually upload a document for all requested documents, otherwise your application will remain on the status \"incomplete\" and will not be processed. If you have uploaded your application documents completely and correctly within the official deadline, you will automatically receive a new admission.\n2. I have postponed my study start and received an admission for the following semester. Which documents do I need to submit for enrollment?\nThe documents you need to submit for enrollment are listed in your TUMonline account.

At my university, we do not use credits at all. What should I do?\nWe assume that all courses are weighted equally. You can indicate one credit for each course. In this case, each course is of the same weight. The total number of credits then is the total number of courses that were part of your study program.\n2. At my university, we have a letter grade scheme. What should I do?\nFor the grade calculation, the Excel sheet does not acept letters, you have to indicate numbers. You can use one number for each letter, i.e. if your grade scheme is A+, A, B, C, D and E = Fail, you have A+=1, A=2, B=3, C=4 and D=5. The highest possible grade is 1, the lowest grade to pass the course is 4. If your grading scheme is A+, A, B+, B etc., you have A+=1, A=2, B+=3, B=4 etc.\n3. I have more than one degree. Can I indicate all courses and grades in the Excel sheet?\nIf you are applying for M.Sc. Robotics, Cognition and Intelligence, you can only specify courses and grades from a single Bachelor's program for the grade calculation. This must be the Bachelor's degree that qualifies for the Master's degree and that you have indicated in TUMonline as your entrance qualification for the Master's program. If you are applying for M.Sc. Information Systems or M.Sc. Informatics: Games Engineering, you can enter courses from more than one program in part 2 (matching your courses with courses at TUM), but only courses and grades from one program (the master's entrance qualification) in part 3 (calculating the grade). You have to prove all entered grades and credits by uploading a corresponding Transcript of Records of all courses.\nPostponing of the study start\n1. I have been admitted, but I have to postpone the start of my studies. Is that possible?\nYes, you can postpone the start of your studies. After reapplying (!) via TUMonline within the regular application periods, you can receive a new admission for the respective semester. The new application works as follows:\nYou enter a new application in TUMonline and upload an updated CV (!). The rest of the documents must also be uploaded again, but here you can use the same documents which you submitted for the first application. This means that you do not have to write a new essay and a new statement of reasons, but you can upload the documents from the first application again here.\nPlease make sure that you actually upload a document for all requested documents, otherwise your application will remain on the status \"incomplete\" and will not be processed. If you have uploaded your application documents completely and correctly within the official deadline, you will automatically receive a new admission.\n2. I have postponed my study start and received an admission for the following semester. Which documents do I need to submit for enrollment?\nThe documents you need to submit for enrollment are listed in your TUMonline account.

At my university, we do not use credits at all. What should I do?\nWe assume that all courses are weighted equally. You can indicate one credit for each course. In this case, each course is of the same weight. The total number of credits then is the total number of courses that were part of your study program.\n2. At my university, we have a letter grade scheme. What should I do?\nFor the grade calculation, the Excel sheet does not acept letters, you have to indicate numbers. You can use one number for each letter, i.e. if your grade scheme is A+, A, B, C, D and E = Fail, you have A+=1, A=2, B=3, C=4 and D=5. The highest possible grade is 1, the lowest grade to pass the course is 4. If your grading scheme is A+, A, B+, B etc., you have A+=1, A=2, B+=3, B=4 etc.\n3. I have more than one degree. Can I indicate all courses and grades in the Excel sheet?\nIf you are applying for M.Sc. Robotics, Cognition and Intelligence, you can only specify courses and grades from a single Bachelor's program for the grade calculation. This must be the Bachelor's degree that qualifies for the Master's degree and that you have indicated in TUMonline as your entrance qualification for the Master's program. If you are applying for M.Sc. Information Systems or M.Sc. Informatics: Games Engineering, you can enter courses from more than one program in part 2 (matching your courses with courses at TUM), but only courses and grades from one program (the master's entrance qualification) in part 3 (calculating the grade). You have to prove all entered grades and credits by uploading a corresponding Transcript of Records of all courses.\nPostponing of the study start\n1. I have been admitted, but I have to postpone the start of my studies. Is that possible?\nYes, you can postpone the start of your studies. After reapplying (!) via TUMonline within the regular application periods, you can receive a new admission for the respective semester. The new application works as follows:\nYou enter a new application in TUMonline and upload an updated CV (!). The rest of the documents must also be uploaded again, but here you can use the same documents which you submitted for the first application. This means that you do not have to write a new essay and a new statement of reasons, but you can upload the documents from the first application again here.\nPlease make sure that you actually upload a document for all requested documents, otherwise your application will remain on the status \"incomplete\" and will not be processed. If you have uploaded your application documents completely and correctly within the official deadline, you will automatically receive a new admission.\n2. I have postponed my study start and received an admission for the following semester. Which documents do I need to submit for enrollment?\nThe documents you need to submit for enrollment are listed in your TUMonline account. You can also find information here: https://www.tum.de/en/studies/application/enrollment-info-portal/enrollment\nPlease note that some required documents must be submitted in paper, and that some documents have to be submitted as certified copies for the enrollment: https://www.tum.de/en/studies/application/application-info-portal/notarization\nFAQ Application\nAnalysis of the Curriculum\n1.

You will receive an e-mail asking you to confirm your thesis registration. Only after you have confirmed your registration, the Academic Programs Office will be able to check the admission requirements, and you will receive an email confirming your binding registration for your thesis.\nUnder Abschlussarbeiten on the CIT Knowledge Hub employees can find a comprehensive documentation of the administration of theses in the CIT portal.\nStudents have to be enrolled when they take an exam (including the thesis).\nIn accordance with § 18 subsection (1) APSO students must be enrolled in the respective program until completion and submission of the final thesis (Bachelor's Thesis or Master's Thesis). This is true even if the period for writing the thesis was extended for reasons beyond a student’s control.\nFor all other exams, however, the time until the first week of classes belongs to the exam period of the previous semester. Therefore, in that case, students only have to be enrolled until the end of the previous semster. For exams which take place until the end of the first week of classes of the new semester no obligation for enrollment exists. This is also true for the usually with a final thesis associated mandatory colloquium (Bachelor) or mandatory presentation (Master). Students who have submitted their final thesis in the previous semester therefore do not have to be enrolled for a colloquium or presentation which takes place until the end of the first week of classes.\nPlease note: If the colloquium or presentation takes place after submitting the final thesis and if this is the last requirement of the program, then the day of the colloquium or the presentation also is the date of the certificate (and not the date of submission of the thesis).\nPlease be sure to note this when reporting grades: When entering titles for grade reports, please ensure that the rules of capitalization are applied correctly in English: Use of English in thesis titles\nAs the data is automatically transferred from the CIT Portal, the correct spelling must be entered. Please note that both the “German title” field and the “English title” field must be filled in. If there is no German title, please also enter the English title in the “German title” field.\n• Mathematics\n• Informatics\n• Electrical & Computer Engineering\n• You can log in to the CIT portal with your TUM ID and get an overview of your thesis.\n• If necessary, you can apply for an extension in the CIT portal.\n• Further functions will follow in the coming months.",
