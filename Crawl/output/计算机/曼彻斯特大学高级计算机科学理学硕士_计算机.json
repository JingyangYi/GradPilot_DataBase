Computer science itself now contains a variety of specialisms, and students on this course can choose where they want to specialise, from topics in artificial intelligence, cyber security, data engineering, machine learning human computer interaction and software engineering.\nThe unique breadth of this course provides the opportunity to explore more than one interest, while the structure of the programme enables students to obtain knowledge, understanding and skills at an advanced level.\nThis programme will provide training and experience of advanced computational techniques, and provide an opportunity to put them into practice in an individual project.\nThe aim of the Advanced Computer Science programme is to enable graduate computer scientists to deepen their knowledge in one, or a few, specialisms. At the end of this programme, students will be able to:\nFlexibility\nYou will choose four from ten themes, each of which combines two related course units.\nStrong links with employers\nWe maintain close relationships with potential employers and run various activities throughout the year, including career fairs, guest lectures, and projects run jointly with partners from industry.\nExcellent facilities\nYou will have access to a fantastic range of facilities and equipment. In Kilburn Building, our hub of Computer Science, this includes our hardware library – equipped with everything from basic electronic components to VR headsets and drones. You can also study, research and benefit from       Our Home for Engineering and Materials\n.\nWelcoming community\nYou can join some of the Department's various student societies, such as the Manchester University Data Science Society, UniCS, Sustainable Engineering Initiative, Volunteering and Outreach, Women in Science and Engineering and many more. Meet like-minded people, make new friends, master your subject, and discover just how powerful collaboration can be!\nChampioning gender diversity\nIt's our priority to make sure students feel seen and supported on their journey, so we're always looking to spotlight and uplift women, non-binary, and otherwise marginalised voices. Get first-hand guidance and insight from students, lecturers, and industry professionals from all different stages of their journey, on our podcast       Big Sisters in STEM\n.\nAt Manchester you will be taught by academic staff who are leading experts in computer science, in a diverse and inclusive learning environment.\nWe use a combination of methods, including lectures, workshops, computer-based sessions, and blended learning.\nYou will learn through a mix of lectures and seminars, supported by practical exercises. The resulting skills are then built on and augmented through an MSc project, enabling you to put into practice the techniques you have been taught throughout the course.\nThis course aims to impart advanced knowledge across a broad range of Computer Science, offering training in advanced skills. It is suitable for those who wish to enhance their computing skills to improve their contribution to IT-related industry or to pursue R&D in academia or industry.\nAs this course is designed specifically to give you freedom and flexibility to tailor your learning, there are no compulsory units, leaving you to build your year as you choose – with the exception of your Master’s Project. You will choose four from ten themes, each of which combines two related course units that build on each other.\nMasters Project (60 credits)\nThe masters project enables students to carry out a substantial technical task of relevance to their programme. The project is supported by taught material that equips students to conduct the project, relating to project planning, ethical and legal issues, technical writing, and quantitative and qualitative methods for evaluating research outcomes.\nOptional Modules:\nThe course unit details given below are subject to change, and are the latest example of the curriculum available on this course of study.\nComputer Science at Manchester has a distinguished history of world-changing research contributions. In the most recent national review of university research, 99% of our return was rated world leading or internationally excellent, and we received the highest possible score for our research environment. Our MSc programmes are designed and delivered by subject specialist, whose research is at the cutting edge of the areas in which they teach.\nWe offer a number of postgraduate taught scholarships and awards to outstanding UK and international students each year.\nThe University of Manchester is committed to widening participation in master's study, and allocates £300,000 in funding each year. Our         Manchester Master's Bursaries\n are aimed at widening access to masters courses by removing barriers to postgraduate education for students from underrepresented groups.\nFor more information, see the Department ofComputer Science        Fees and funding page\n or visit the University of Manchester         funding for master's courses website\n for more information.\nWould you like to discover authentic stories when it comes to life at, and after, The University of Manchester?
