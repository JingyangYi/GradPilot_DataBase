On the online application, simply rank your programs of interest in order of preference and you will be considered for each program that you include.\nCan I pursue a graduate degree on a part-time basis?We do not offer any part-time tracks. Masters students who are not precluded by visa restrictions may take courses on a part-time basis. Note that immigration regulations do not allow Carnegie Mellon University to issue visa documents for a part-time MS program. Interested students should be aware that most of our courses are offered on campus and during the day, so working professionals should plan their schedules accordingly. We do not offer any of the PhD programs on a part-time basis.\nCan I apply for the MS in ECE program in Silicon Valley?We are no longer direct-admitting students into the MS in ECE program located in Silicon Valley. All students in the MS in ECE program must begin their studies in Pittsburgh. MS ECE students who are interested in spending a portion of their studies in Silicon Valley may work with their advisors to pursue this option.\nCan I apply for the MS in Software Engineering program in Silicon Valley?Yes, we still welcome and encourage applicants to the MS in Software Engineering program in Silicon Valley. This is a fast-growing program within the ECE Department in Silicon Valley, and applicants are advised to review the details and the Application Guidelines of this unique program prior to submitting an application.\nCan I apply for a PhD program in Silicon Valley?No, we are no longer admitting new students to any of the PhD programs located in Silicon Valley.\nI do not have a background in ECE.

Any hard copy letters mailed to the ECE Admissions Office will be discarded.\n• Transcripts: Unofficial transcripts must be uploaded to the online application and school information must be entered. The ECE Admissions Office will only require an official hard copy of your transcript if you are admitted and decide to accept your offer of admission. In order for transcripts to be considered official, they must be received directly from the university in a signed and sealed envelope.\n• GRE and DET, TOEFL, or IELTS Score Reports: Self-reported scores must be entered into the online application. In addition, it is required that the ECE Admissions Office receive official electronic or hard copy GRE and DET/TOEFL/IELTS score reports in order for your application to be considered complete. Please note that the GRE is optional for the Fall 2025 and Spring 2026 admissions cycle.\n• You must enter your test/score information into the application. If you had previously entered a \"pending\" test into your application, you must log back in and enter the scores and test data.\n• You must request the testing center (ETS/Duolingo/IELTS) to send CMU the official scores.\n• All full-time PhD students accepted through the normal application process receive fellowships that pay tuition, fees, and a stipend for living expenses for the duration of their PhD program, as long as sufficient progress is made toward degree completion. These fellowships are offered during both the fall and spring admission processes. There is not a separate financial aid form/process. These awards are sufficient to cover all expenses for the year (including summers). Research assistantships are awarded based upon departmental resources and available research project openings, as well as a student's overall academic and research background as shown in their application. Students are required to pay for books and course supplies. Off-campus housing is available within walking distance of campus.\n• Our Professional MS programs are self-funded, course-only degree programs. These programs take approximately 1.5–2 years (3–4 semesters) to complete, depending on the degree program. View information about the current tuition rate and cost of attendance. Information about financial aid can be found here.",

Students admitted as undecided within the College of Engineering are allowed to choose among the primary majors during the spring semester of their first year.Requests to change majors will be considered after the first year but are not guaranteed to be approved and will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.\nMost applications are due by the following dates:\nFor the Fall 2025 and Spring 2026 admission cycles, the GRE requirement will be optional. Applicants who do not submit a GRE score report as part of their application package will be considered equally for admission along with those who do submit scores. The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering is committed to a holistic approach to admission. Apart from English language proficiency, no single grade, factor, score, or activity guarantees or disqualifies any candidate’s admission to the department. We treat every applicant as an individual, taking care to make our admission decisions fairly, thoroughly, and in context. We're interested in students who can succeed and thrive within the ECE Department, contributing to the Carnegie Mellon Community through their unique backgrounds.\nAll international and United States permanent resident applicants must take an English language proficiency exam. This is required as a component in determining academic success in the program and to support visa applications for admitted students studying on an F1 visa. The scores must be received by the application deadline for the semester in which students are applying. An English language proficiency test is not required if the applicant will have graduated from a US university by the time of enrollment or if the applicant is a CMU student or alum. It is also not required for applicants with United Kingdom or Canadian citizenship. The following forms of English language proficiency assessments are accepted:\nDuolingo English Test: A minimum overall score of 115 is required, with minimum subscores of Literacy 105, Comprehension 115, Production 90, and Conversation 95.\nTOEFL Exam: A minimum overall score of 86 is required, with minimum subscores of IBT-R 22, IBT-L 22, IBT-S 20, and IBT-W 22. These requirements must be met from a single test date—we currently do not accept TOEFL MyBest scores.\nIELTS Exam: A minimum overall score of 7 on the IELTS is required, with minimum subscores of Reading 6.5, Listening 6.5, Speaking 6, and Writing 6.\nFinancial aid is awarded upon admission in the form of research assistantships based upon departmental resources and available openings. If available, financial aid is awarded for both the fall and spring semesters. There is not a special financial aid form.\nVirtually all graduate students in the research intensive PhD program receive financial aid, in the form of fellowships, that cover tuition, fees, and reasonable living expenses for the entire year. Thus, students can concentrate on course work and research without financial concerns or interruptions. All applicants are considered for financial aid. No special form is required. All full-time students in the PhD program engage in research under faculty guidance.\nStudents in the Professional MS program are ineligible to receive departmental fellowships that cover tuition and living expenses. Students in this course-intensive program are primarily self-supported, but may be eligible to receive partial financial support in the form of hourly wages to support the teaching and research missions of the department. Students in the Professional MS program must complete at least two academic semesters before they may be admitted into the PhD program. Only students in the PhD program can be considered for departmental financial support in the form of tuition and stipend.\nPlease note that a non-refundable application fee of $75 is required of all applicants and only those applications received with the fee will be processed. Applications received without the fee will not be processed and the application fee cannot be waived.\nPlease see the FAQ.\nCarnegie Mellon University does not discriminate in admission, employment or administration of its programs or activities on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, handicap or disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status or genetic information.
