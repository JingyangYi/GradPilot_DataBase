In addition to taking classes already offered at the Journalism and Engineering schools, students will attend a seminar and workshop designed specifically for the dual degree program. The seminar will teach students about the impact of digital techniques on journalism; the emerging role of citizens in the news process; the influence of social media; and the changing business models that will support news gathering. In the workshop, students will use a hands-on approach to delve deeply into information design, focusing on how to build a site, section, or application from concept to development, ensuring the editorial goals are kept uppermost in mind.\nWant to learn more? Visit the program website!\nA small number of highly qualified students are admitted each year to the PhD Program in Computer Science. Admission is very competitive, based primarily on research-oriented reference letters, academic grades, and overall experience and record. Applicants need not already hold a master’s degree; bachelor’s degree-level applicants are also encouraged to apply.\nMost admitted students receive full financial support through Graduate Research Assistantships, which consist of a monthly stipend plus full tuition exemption (continuation of support is, of course, contingent upon the student’s satisfactory progress in the PhD Program and availability of funding). In addition, the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science awards a small number of prestigious “Presidential Distinguished Fellowships.” These fellowships provide full financial support to their recipients. Applicants are strongly encouraged to seek external funding, such as government and industry fellowships. Also, Columbia rents low-cost subsidized apartments near campus for both single students and students with families.\nAll PhD students are expected to participate in departmental and laboratory activity full-time on-campus throughout the program, except possibly for summer internships elsewhere. Therefore, the department does not normally consider admission of part-time students.\nAlso, note that it is not possible to participate in the PhD Program through the Columbia Video Network.\nAll applications to our PhD Program must be made electronically. The online application system is available on the SEAS Admissions website. The deadlines for the submission of your fully completed application are:\nYou can still apply after these deadlines. However, be aware that applications are usually reviewed soon after the deadline, so late applications may not be processed as quickly or have the best chance of getting funding from our department.\nThe SEAS Admissions website contains detailed information about all aspects of the application process.\nYou are also encouraged to investigate the research conducted in the Department of Computer Science prior to application. In particular, think about which faculty members share your research interests and also look at the research group homepages. Feel free to contact potential faculty advisors by email to request information about their recent research and publications and to ask about opportunities in their research groups or labs.\nFinally, become familiar with our PhD degree requirements.\nIf you are interested in learning more about a day in the life of our PhD students, check out the Demystifying the Dissertation: PhD Research Discussions seminar series, which highlights several Computer Science PhD students. In their videos, these students discuss their experiences and research projects.\nThe PhD PAR program offers a one-time review of an applicant’s Personal Statement and CV. The review is done by a current computer science PhD student.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”\nThis recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.\nI am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment. We are fortunate to have the privilege to learn from one another, and to study, work, and live together in such a dynamic and vibrant place as Columbia.\nMary C.

CS MS applicants need to follow the Master of Science Deadlines.\n\nMS PROGRAMS\nThe Master of Science (MS) program is intended for those who wish to broaden and deepen their understanding of computer science. Columbia University and the New York City environment provide excellent career opportunities in multiple industries. The program provides a unique opportunity to develop leading-edge in-depth knowledge of specific computer science disciplines.\nMS applicants whose primary interests include software engineering, theory, AI, machine learning, vision/graphics, natural language processing, or other core CS areas should apply to the Computer Science MS Program.\nMS applicants whose primary interests include computer architecture, parallel systems, embedded systems, or digital/VLSI design should apply to the Computer Engineering MS Program.\n MS Application Priority Deadlines \nApplications will be accepted after priority deadlines; however, we encourage you to submit your application as early as possible after we open the application. \n\nFall: January 15th (Priority), February 15th (Regular)\nSpring: October 15\n\n \n Track Options \n\n\n\nComputational Biology \nNatural Language Processing\n\n\nComputer Security\nSoftware Systems\n\n\nFoundations of Computer Science\nVision and Graphics\n\n\nMachine Learning\nPersonalized\n\n\nNetwork Systems\nMS Thesis\n\n\n\n  Still have questions? View our CS MS Application FAQs  \n\n\nDUAL MS IN JOURNALISM AND COMPUTER SCIENCE\nAdmitted students will enroll for a total of five semesters — approximately three in The Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science and two in the Journalism School. In addition to taking classes already offered at the Journalism and Engineering schools, students will attend a seminar and workshop designed specifically for the dual degree program. The seminar will teach students about the impact of digital techniques on journalism; the emerging role of citizens in the news process; the influence of social media; and the changing business models that will support news gathering. In the workshop, students will use a hands-on approach to delve deeply into information design, focusing on how to build a site, section, or application from concept to development, ensuring the editorial goals are kept uppermost in mind.\n  Want to learn more? Visit the program website!  \n\nPHD PROGRAM\nA small number of highly qualified students are admitted each year to the PhD Program in Computer Science. Admission is very competitive, based primarily on research-oriented reference letters, academic grades, and overall experience and record. Applicants need not already hold a master’s degree; bachelor’s degree-level applicants are also encouraged to apply.\nMost admitted students receive full financial support through Graduate Research Assistantships, which consist of a monthly stipend plus full tuition exemption (continuation of support is, of course, contingent upon the student’s satisfactory progress in the PhD Program and availability of funding). In addition, the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science awards a small number of prestigious “Presidential Distinguished Fellowships.” These fellowships provide full financial support to their recipients. Applicants are strongly encouraged to seek external funding, such as government and industry fellowships. Also, Columbia rents low-cost subsidized apartments near campus for both single students and students with families.\nAll PhD students are expected to participate in departmental and laboratory activity full-time on-campus throughout the program, except possibly for summer internships elsewhere. Therefore, the department does not normally consider admission of part-time students.\nAlso, note that it is not possible to participate in the PhD Program through the Columbia Video Network.\n HOW AND WHEN TO APPLY TO THE PHD PROGRAM \nAll applications to our PhD Program must be made electronically. The online application system is available on the SEAS Admissions website. The deadlines for the submission of your fully completed application are:\n\nStarting the PhD Program in the Spring semester: apply by October 15 of the previous year\nStarting the PhD Program in the Fall semester: apply by December 15 of the previous year\n\nYou can still apply after these deadlines. However, be aware that applications are usually reviewed soon after the deadline, so late applications may not be processed as quickly or have the best chance of getting funding from our department.\n HOW TO GET MORE INFORMATION \nThe SEAS Admissions website contains detailed information about all aspects of the application process.\nYou are also encouraged to investigate the research conducted in the Department of Computer Science prior to application. In particular, think about which faculty members share your research interests and also look at the research group homepages. Feel free to contact potential faculty advisors by email to request information about their recent research and publications and to ask about opportunities in their research groups or labs.\nFinally, become familiar with our PhD degree requirements.\nIf you are interested in learning more about a day in the life of our PhD students, check out the Demystifying the Dissertation: PhD Research Discussions seminar series, which highlights several Computer Science PhD students. In their videos, these students discuss their experiences and research projects.\n COMPUTER SCIENCE PhD PRE-SUBMISSION APPLICATION REVIEW (PAR) PROGRAM \nThe PhD PAR program offers a one-time review of an applicant’s Personal Statement and CV. The review is done by a current computer science PhD student. For more information, please visit PhD Pre-Submission Application Review Program.\n\nQUESTIONS?\nWe receive an enormous volume of emails with application-related questions, so read the FAQ page carefully before sending us an email. Questions about particular research groups or individual faculty members should be directed to the appropriate faculty members by email.\n\n\n\n Transcripts, GRE/TOEFL/ IELTS, fee waivers\n  Office of Graduate Student Affairs\n\n\n Undergraduate Admissions\n  Office of Undergraduate Admissions\n\n\n CS MS Admissions\n  MS Admissions\n\n\n CS PhD Admissions\n  PhD Admissions\n\n\n CVN MS Program\n  CVN\n\n\n\n \n\nUpdated 10/15/2024\nAdmissions Information\nFind open faculty positions here.\n\n\nComputer Science at Columbia University\n\n\n\n\n\nUpcoming Events\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                   Sep                                           \n\n                                   12                                           \n\n\n\nCS Career Advising Walk-In Hours\n\nFriday 2:00 pm\nCS Lounge\n, CS Careers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                   Sep                                           \n\n                                   19                                           \n\n\n\nCS Career Advising Walk-In Hours\n\nFriday 11:00 am\nCS Lounge\n, CS Careers\n\n\n\n\nView All >>\n\n\n\nIn the News\n\n\n\n\nPress Mentions\nFind open faculty positions here.\nComputer Science at Columbia University\nUpcoming Events\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                   Sep                                           \n\n                                   12                                           \n\n\n\nCS Career Advising Walk-In Hours\n\nFriday 2:00 pm\nCS Lounge\n, CS Careers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                   Sep                                           \n\n                                   19                                           \n\n\n\nCS Career Advising Walk-In Hours\n\nFriday 11:00 am\nCS Lounge\n, CS Careers\n\n\n\n\nView All >>\nSep                                           \n\n                                   12                                           \n\n\n\nCS Career Advising Walk-In Hours\n\nFriday 2:00 pm\nCS Lounge\n, CS Careers\nSep                                           \n\n                                   12\nCS Career Advising Walk-In Hours\n\nFriday 2:00 pm\nCS Lounge\n, CS Careers\nSep                                           \n\n                                   19                                           \n\n\n\nCS Career Advising Walk-In Hours\n\nFriday 11:00 am\nCS Lounge\n, CS Careers\nSep                                           \n\n                                   19\nCS Career Advising Walk-In Hours\n\nFriday 11:00 am\nCS Lounge\n, CS Careers\nIn the News\nPress Mentions\n[GRID_TABLE]\nFind open faculty positions here.\nComputer Science at Columbia University\nUpcoming Events\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                   Sep                                           \n\n                                   12                                           \n\n\n\nCS Career Advising Walk-In Hours\n\nFriday 2:00 pm\nCS Lounge\n, CS Careers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                   Sep                                           \n\n                                   19                                           \n\n\n\nCS Career Advising Walk-In Hours\n\nFriday 11:00 am\nCS Lounge\n, CS Careers\n\n\n\n\nView All >>\nSep                                           \n\n                                   12                                           \n\n\n\nCS Career Advising Walk-In Hours\n\nFriday 2:00 pm\nCS Lounge\n, CS Careers\nSep                                           \n\n                                   12\nCS Career Advising Walk-In Hours\n\nFriday 2:00 pm\nCS Lounge\n, CS Careers\nSep                                           \n\n                                   19                                           \n\n\n\nCS Career Advising Walk-In Hours\n\nFriday 11:00 am\nCS Lounge\n, CS Careers\nSep                                           \n\n                                   19\nCS Career Advising Walk-In Hours\n\nFriday 11:00 am\nCS Lounge\n, CS Careers\nIn the News\nPress Mentions\n[GRID_TABLE]\nSep                                           \n\n                                   12\nCS Career Advising Walk-In Hours\n\nFriday 2:00 pm\nCS Lounge\n, CS Careers\n[GRID_TABLE]\nSep                                           \n\n                                   19\nCS Career Advising Walk-In Hours\n\nFriday 11:00 am\nCS Lounge\n, CS Careers",

The review is done by a current computer science PhD student.\n[HEADING] ABOUT THE PHD PRE-SUBMISSION APPLICATION REVIEW (PAR) PROGRAM\n[HEADING] GET TO KNOW THE WORK OF OUR PHD STUDENTS\n[HEADING] Computer Science at Columbia University\n[HEADING] Upcoming Events\n[HEADING] CS Career Advising Walk-In Hours\n[HEADING] In the News\n[HEADING] Press Mentions\n[HEADING] Dean Boyce's statement on amicus brief filed by President Bollinger\n[HEADING] {{title}}\n[HEADING] Bio\n[HEADING] {{title}} {{fullname}}\n[HEADING] Courses This Semester\nAs we enter the 21st century and beyond, Science, Technology, and its related fields – including Computer Science – will play a key role in shaping the future of our society. Institutions such as Columbia University will be instrumental in working on the most important problems in the field as well as educating the next generation of academics and researchers who will go on to make their own invaluable contributions.\nIn light of this reality, a group of current PhD students in the department is helping to establish the most accessible PhD application process possible to promote a diverse and welcoming intellectual environment for all.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”\nThis recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.\nI am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment.

Please be sure to read through our pages and complete keyword searches to help you gather information and make the most informed decision possible regarding the next step in your educational career.\nUndergraduates wanting to major in computer science first apply through one of four undergraduate schools:\nApplications received and considered complete by these priority deadlines will be reviewed in the first or second priority group of applications. We recommend you submit your application a couple of weeks before the priority deadline to ensure that all materials, including recommendation letters, are received by the deadline.\nThe Department of Computer Science at Columbia has distinguished research strengths in a number of areas, including vision and computer graphics, computer and network security, networks, machine learning, computer architecture, and natural language processing. Examples of specific research groups are:\nA complete list of research groups can be found here.\nColumbia University offers a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. The BA major encourages students to obtain broad exposure to the arts, humanities, and social sciences while providing them with the appropriate Computer Science background necessary for graduate study or a professional career. The BS major encourages students to obtain broad exposure to the engineering core while providing the proper Computer Science background for further activities in academia or industry.\nMost Computer Science program graduates at Columbia step directly into career positions in Computer Science with industry or government or continue their education in graduate degree programs. Many choose to combine Computer Science with a second career interest by taking additional programs in business administration, medicine, or other professional studies. Students graduating from Columbia’s Computer Science Department find themselves well-suited to continue graduate-level studies in top-name institutions.  However, all students who complete the program have the knowledge required to pursue various careers either within the computer industry or elsewhere.\nFinally, Columbia’s location allows students to take advantage of the proximity to many potential future employers based in New York City and the city’s many cultural attractions.\nThe Computer Science department has many research opportunities available during the academic year– many of the faculty sponsor undergraduate and master’s students for research projects in their groups. Typically, the faculty sponsors the students for credit, but in some cases, projects also provide a stipend. Please see the list of departmental research areas. There are additional Research Opportunities posted online that students can get involved with.\nThere are multiple ways for students to get involved in research as a Columbia student. Current Research Opportunities are posted online. CS Advising also sends research opportunities to students via the student list-serves email. These can be for credit or pay. Additional opportunities are also advertised through the Center for Career Education (CCE). Our Career Placement Officers can assist students with applying for and interviewing for internships and fellowships.\nIn addition to graduate study, our students have gone on to a variety of careers either within the computer industry or elsewhere. Generally, the majority of our graduates have found positions at established computer/software companies (e.g., Microsoft, Google), research labs (e.g., IBM), or Wall Street firms (e.g., Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs). Other graduates have found positions at smaller companies or startups (e.g., foursquare). A few students have gone on to work or study outside of the field of Computer Science, applying their knowledge of the discipline to another field, such as business, medicine, or law. For more information regarding Career Opportunities and placements, click here.\nAccording to a recent survey, approximately 20 to 30% of our graduates go on to graduate school.\nThe Computer Science major for SEAS students is more rigorous than other colleges. SEAS students take a minimum of 74 to 75 points, whereas Columbia College, Barnard, and General students CS majors pursue the same program with a minimum of 41 to 44 points. These students take more credits toward their college requirements and less towards the major than SEAS students.\nThe courses available and opportunities for research do not differ.\nIt may be possible to complete a double major in these circumstances as a Columbia College or General Studies student. Please consult your Advising Dean.\nWhile there is substantial cross-over between the two disciplines, in general, the Computer Science major focuses more on theory, software, and applications, whereas Computer Engineering focuses more on computer hardware, digital system development, and system design.\nNo, the Office of Undergraduate Admissions processes undergraduate applications. If you have specific questions about admissions, please contact the Office of Undergraduate Admissions.\nPlease see the official application requirements on the SEAS website here.

Which areas of CS are particularly strong at Columbia?\n\n\n\n\nThe Department of Computer Science at Columbia has distinguished research strengths in a number of areas, including vision and computer graphics, computer and network security, networks, machine learning, computer architecture, and natural language processing. Examples of specific research groups are:\n\n\n\nGraphics and User Interfaces\nSecurity; Intrusion Detection\nLanguages & Compilers\nMachine Learning\nSpeech and Natural Language Processing\nNetwork Computing\nSoftware Systems\nVision and Robotics\n\n\n\nA complete list of research groups can be found here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Why should I pursue an undergraduate degree in Computer Science at Columbia?\n\n\n\n\nColumbia University offers a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. The BA major encourages students to obtain broad exposure to the arts, humanities, and social sciences while providing them with the appropriate Computer Science background necessary for graduate study or a professional career. The BS major encourages students to obtain broad exposure to the engineering core while providing the proper Computer Science background for further activities in academia or industry.\nMost Computer Science program graduates at Columbia step directly into career positions in Computer Science with industry or government or continue their education in graduate degree programs. Many choose to combine Computer Science with a second career interest by taking additional programs in business administration, medicine, or other professional studies. Students graduating from Columbia’s Computer Science Department find themselves well-suited to continue graduate-level studies in top-name institutions.  However, all students who complete the program have the knowledge required to pursue various careers either within the computer industry or elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        What makes your Computer Science program stand out compared to other top programs and institutions?\n\n\n\n Many of the CS teaching faculty are leaders in their research field and/or have extensive experience in industry and private sector research labs. CS majors at Columbia have the opportunity to be taught and advised by world-renowned computer scientists who have well-developed collaborative relationships with companies such as Bell Labs, IBM, Lucent, and Microsoft, as well as other leaders in the field.\nFinally, Columbia’s location allows students to take advantage of the proximity to many potential future employers based in New York City and the city’s many cultural attractions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        What opportunities are there to get involved in Computer Science research at Columbia?\n\n\n\n\nThe Computer Science department has many research opportunities available during the academic year– many of the faculty sponsor undergraduate and master’s students for research projects in their groups. Typically, the faculty sponsors the students for credit, but in some cases, projects also provide a stipend. Please see the list of departmental research areas. There are additional Research Opportunities posted online that students can get involved with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        What research, internship, and fellowships opportunities exist during the summer months, and how do I participate?\n\n\n\n\nThere are multiple ways for students to get involved in research as a Columbia student. Current Research Opportunities are posted online. CS Advising also sends research opportunities to students via the student list-serves email. These can be for credit or pay. Additional opportunities are also advertised through the Center for Career Education (CCE). Our Career Placement Officers can assist students with applying for and interviewing for internships and fellowships.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        What kinds of career opportunities would this major/concentration prepare me for?\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to graduate study, our students have gone on to a variety of careers either within the computer industry or elsewhere. Generally, the majority of our graduates have found positions at established computer/software companies (e.g., Microsoft, Google), research labs (e.g., IBM), or Wall Street firms (e.g., Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs). Other graduates have found positions at smaller companies or startups (e.g., foursquare). A few students have gone on to work or study outside of the field of Computer Science, applying their knowledge of the discipline to another field, such as business, medicine, or law. For more information regarding Career Opportunities and placements, click here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        What percentage of your Computer Science undergraduates go on to graduate school?\n\n\n\n\nAccording to a recent survey, approximately 20 to 30% of our graduates go on to graduate school.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        How does the Computer Science program differ between the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS), Columbia College, Barnard, and General Studies?\n\n\n\n\nThe Computer Science major for SEAS students is more rigorous than other colleges. SEAS students take a minimum of 74 to 75 points, whereas Columbia College, Barnard, and General students CS majors pursue the same program with a minimum of 41 to 44 points. These students take more credits toward their college requirements and less towards the major than SEAS students.\nThe courses available and opportunities for research do not differ.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Is it possible to do a double major with an entirely different subject (e.g., English)?\n\n\n\n\nIt may be possible to complete a double major in these circumstances as a Columbia College or General Studies student. Please consult your Advising Dean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        What are the differences between the Computer Science and Computer Engineering degrees?\n\n\n\n\nWhile there is substantial cross-over between the two disciplines, in general, the Computer Science major focuses more on theory, software, and applications, whereas Computer Engineering focuses more on computer hardware, digital system development, and system design.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Does the CS department process undergraduate admissions?\n\n\n\n\nNo, the Office of Undergraduate Admissions processes undergraduate applications.

We recommend you submit your application a couple of weeks before the priority deadline to ensure that all materials, including recommendation letters, are received by the deadline.\n CS Programs Fall  Spring Doctoral: MS/PhD*, PhD December 15October 15 Master of Science (CS MS) Priority: January 15  October 15 Final Deadline: February 15 MS Express Application (Columbia Undergrads only) Regular: February 15 October 15 Final Deadline: May 1st Dual MS, CS & Journalism January 15 N/A CS@CU MS Bridge Program February 15th N/A\n\nWHY CS@CU?\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Is there a specific emphasis on expertise and research within the Computer Science Department at Columbia? Which areas of CS are particularly strong at Columbia?\n\n\n\n\nThe Department of Computer Science at Columbia has distinguished research strengths in a number of areas, including vision and computer graphics, computer and network security, networks, machine learning, computer architecture, and natural language processing. Examples of specific research groups are:\n\n\n\nGraphics and User Interfaces\nSecurity; Intrusion Detection\nLanguages & Compilers\nMachine Learning\nSpeech and Natural Language Processing\nNetwork Computing\nSoftware Systems\nVision and Robotics\n\n\n\nA complete list of research groups can be found here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Why should I pursue an undergraduate degree in Computer Science at Columbia?\n\n\n\n\nColumbia University offers a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. The BA major encourages students to obtain broad exposure to the arts, humanities, and social sciences while providing them with the appropriate Computer Science background necessary for graduate study or a professional career. The BS major encourages students to obtain broad exposure to the engineering core while providing the proper Computer Science background for further activities in academia or industry.\nMost Computer Science program graduates at Columbia step directly into career positions in Computer Science with industry or government or continue their education in graduate degree programs. Many choose to combine Computer Science with a second career interest by taking additional programs in business administration, medicine, or other professional studies. Students graduating from Columbia’s Computer Science Department find themselves well-suited to continue graduate-level studies in top-name institutions.  However, all students who complete the program have the knowledge required to pursue various careers either within the computer industry or elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        What makes your Computer Science program stand out compared to other top programs and institutions?\n\n\n\n Many of the CS teaching faculty are leaders in their research field and/or have extensive experience in industry and private sector research labs. CS majors at Columbia have the opportunity to be taught and advised by world-renowned computer scientists who have well-developed collaborative relationships with companies such as Bell Labs, IBM, Lucent, and Microsoft, as well as other leaders in the field.\nFinally, Columbia’s location allows students to take advantage of the proximity to many potential future employers based in New York City and the city’s many cultural attractions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        What opportunities are there to get involved in Computer Science research at Columbia?\n\n\n\n\nThe Computer Science department has many research opportunities available during the academic year– many of the faculty sponsor undergraduate and master’s students for research projects in their groups. Typically, the faculty sponsors the students for credit, but in some cases, projects also provide a stipend. Please see the list of departmental research areas. There are additional Research Opportunities posted online that students can get involved with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        What research, internship, and fellowships opportunities exist during the summer months, and how do I participate?\n\n\n\n\nThere are multiple ways for students to get involved in research as a Columbia student. Current Research Opportunities are posted online. CS Advising also sends research opportunities to students via the student list-serves email. These can be for credit or pay. Additional opportunities are also advertised through the Center for Career Education (CCE). Our Career Placement Officers can assist students with applying for and interviewing for internships and fellowships.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        What kinds of career opportunities would this major/concentration prepare me for?\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to graduate study, our students have gone on to a variety of careers either within the computer industry or elsewhere. Generally, the majority of our graduates have found positions at established computer/software companies (e.g., Microsoft, Google), research labs (e.g., IBM), or Wall Street firms (e.g., Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs). Other graduates have found positions at smaller companies or startups (e.g., foursquare). A few students have gone on to work or study outside of the field of Computer Science, applying their knowledge of the discipline to another field, such as business, medicine, or law. For more information regarding Career Opportunities and placements, click here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        What percentage of your Computer Science undergraduates go on to graduate school?\n\n\n\n\nAccording to a recent survey, approximately 20 to 30% of our graduates go on to graduate school.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        How does the Computer Science program differ between the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS), Columbia College, Barnard, and General Studies?\n\n\n\n\nThe Computer Science major for SEAS students is more rigorous than other colleges. SEAS students take a minimum of 74 to 75 points, whereas Columbia College, Barnard, and General students CS majors pursue the same program with a minimum of 41 to 44 points. These students take more credits toward their college requirements and less towards the major than SEAS students.\nThe courses available and opportunities for research do not differ.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Is it possible to do a double major with an entirely different subject (e.g., English)?\n\n\n\n\nIt may be possible to complete a double major in these circumstances as a Columbia College or General Studies student. Please consult your Advising Dean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        What are the differences between the Computer Science and Computer Engineering degrees?\n\n\n\n\nWhile there is substantial cross-over between the two disciplines, in general, the Computer Science major focuses more on theory, software, and applications, whereas Computer Engineering focuses more on computer hardware, digital system development, and system design.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Does the CS department process undergraduate admissions?\n\n\n\n\nNo, the Office of Undergraduate Admissions processes undergraduate applications. If you have specific questions about admissions, please contact the Office of Undergraduate Admissions.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE APPLICATION PROCESS- BRIDGE, MS, DOCTORAL\n\n\n\n\n\n                        What are the application requirements?\n\n\n\n\nPlease see the official application requirements on the SEAS website here.

Examples of specific research groups are:\n\n\n\nGraphics and User Interfaces\nSecurity; Intrusion Detection\nLanguages & Compilers\nMachine Learning\nSpeech and Natural Language Processing\nNetwork Computing\nSoftware Systems\nVision and Robotics\n\n\n\nA complete list of research groups can be found here.\nColumbia University offers a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. The BA major encourages students to obtain broad exposure to the arts, humanities, and social sciences while providing them with the appropriate Computer Science background necessary for graduate study or a professional career. The BS major encourages students to obtain broad exposure to the engineering core while providing the proper Computer Science background for further activities in academia or industry.\nMost Computer Science program graduates at Columbia step directly into career positions in Computer Science with industry or government or continue their education in graduate degree programs. Many choose to combine Computer Science with a second career interest by taking additional programs in business administration, medicine, or other professional studies. Students graduating from Columbia’s Computer Science Department find themselves well-suited to continue graduate-level studies in top-name institutions.  However, all students who complete the program have the knowledge required to pursue various careers either within the computer industry or elsewhere.\nMany of the CS teaching faculty are leaders in their research field and/or have extensive experience in industry and private sector research labs. CS majors at Columbia have the opportunity to be taught and advised by world-renowned computer scientists who have well-developed collaborative relationships with companies such as Bell Labs, IBM, Lucent, and Microsoft, as well as other leaders in the field.\nFinally, Columbia’s location allows students to take advantage of the proximity to many potential future employers based in New York City and the city’s many cultural attractions.\nThe Computer Science department has many research opportunities available during the academic year– many of the faculty sponsor undergraduate and master’s students for research projects in their groups. Typically, the faculty sponsors the students for credit, but in some cases, projects also provide a stipend. Please see the list of departmental research areas. There are additional Research Opportunities posted online that students can get involved with.\nThere are multiple ways for students to get involved in research as a Columbia student. Current Research Opportunities are posted online. CS Advising also sends research opportunities to students via the student list-serves email. These can be for credit or pay. Additional opportunities are also advertised through the Center for Career Education (CCE). Our Career Placement Officers can assist students with applying for and interviewing for internships and fellowships.\nIn addition to graduate study, our students have gone on to a variety of careers either within the computer industry or elsewhere. Generally, the majority of our graduates have found positions at established computer/software companies (e.g., Microsoft, Google), research labs (e.g., IBM), or Wall Street firms (e.g., Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs). Other graduates have found positions at smaller companies or startups (e.g., foursquare). A few students have gone on to work or study outside of the field of Computer Science, applying their knowledge of the discipline to another field, such as business, medicine, or law. For more information regarding Career Opportunities and placements, click here.\nAccording to a recent survey, approximately 20 to 30% of our graduates go on to graduate school.\nThe Computer Science major for SEAS students is more rigorous than other colleges. SEAS students take a minimum of 74 to 75 points, whereas Columbia College, Barnard, and General students CS majors pursue the same program with a minimum of 41 to 44 points. These students take more credits toward their college requirements and less towards the major than SEAS students.\nThe courses available and opportunities for research do not differ.\nIt may be possible to complete a double major in these circumstances as a Columbia College or General Studies student. Please consult your Advising Dean.\nWhile there is substantial cross-over between the two disciplines, in general, the Computer Science major focuses more on theory, software, and applications, whereas Computer Engineering focuses more on computer hardware, digital system development, and system design.\nNo, the Office of Undergraduate Admissions processes undergraduate applications. If you have specific questions about admissions, please contact the Office of Undergraduate Admissions.\nPlease see the official application requirements on the SEAS website here.

Which areas of CS are particularly strong at Columbia?\n\n\n\n\nThe Department of Computer Science at Columbia has distinguished research strengths in a number of areas, including vision and computer graphics, computer and network security, networks, machine learning, computer architecture, and natural language processing. Examples of specific research groups are:\n\n\n\nGraphics and User Interfaces\nSecurity; Intrusion Detection\nLanguages & Compilers\nMachine Learning\nSpeech and Natural Language Processing\nNetwork Computing\nSoftware Systems\nVision and Robotics\n\n\n\nA complete list of research groups can be found here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Why should I pursue an undergraduate degree in Computer Science at Columbia?\n\n\n\n\nColumbia University offers a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. The BA major encourages students to obtain broad exposure to the arts, humanities, and social sciences while providing them with the appropriate Computer Science background necessary for graduate study or a professional career. The BS major encourages students to obtain broad exposure to the engineering core while providing the proper Computer Science background for further activities in academia or industry.\nMost Computer Science program graduates at Columbia step directly into career positions in Computer Science with industry or government or continue their education in graduate degree programs. Many choose to combine Computer Science with a second career interest by taking additional programs in business administration, medicine, or other professional studies. Students graduating from Columbia’s Computer Science Department find themselves well-suited to continue graduate-level studies in top-name institutions.  However, all students who complete the program have the knowledge required to pursue various careers either within the computer industry or elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        What makes your Computer Science program stand out compared to other top programs and institutions?\n\n\n\n Many of the CS teaching faculty are leaders in their research field and/or have extensive experience in industry and private sector research labs. CS majors at Columbia have the opportunity to be taught and advised by world-renowned computer scientists who have well-developed collaborative relationships with companies such as Bell Labs, IBM, Lucent, and Microsoft, as well as other leaders in the field.\nFinally, Columbia’s location allows students to take advantage of the proximity to many potential future employers based in New York City and the city’s many cultural attractions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        What opportunities are there to get involved in Computer Science research at Columbia?\n\n\n\n\nThe Computer Science department has many research opportunities available during the academic year– many of the faculty sponsor undergraduate and master’s students for research projects in their groups. Typically, the faculty sponsors the students for credit, but in some cases, projects also provide a stipend. Please see the list of departmental research areas. There are additional Research Opportunities posted online that students can get involved with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        What research, internship, and fellowships opportunities exist during the summer months, and how do I participate?\n\n\n\n\nThere are multiple ways for students to get involved in research as a Columbia student. Current Research Opportunities are posted online. CS Advising also sends research opportunities to students via the student list-serves email. These can be for credit or pay. Additional opportunities are also advertised through the Center for Career Education (CCE). Our Career Placement Officers can assist students with applying for and interviewing for internships and fellowships.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        What kinds of career opportunities would this major/concentration prepare me for?\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to graduate study, our students have gone on to a variety of careers either within the computer industry or elsewhere. Generally, the majority of our graduates have found positions at established computer/software companies (e.g., Microsoft, Google), research labs (e.g., IBM), or Wall Street firms (e.g., Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs). Other graduates have found positions at smaller companies or startups (e.g., foursquare). A few students have gone on to work or study outside of the field of Computer Science, applying their knowledge of the discipline to another field, such as business, medicine, or law. For more information regarding Career Opportunities and placements, click here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        What percentage of your Computer Science undergraduates go on to graduate school?\n\n\n\n\nAccording to a recent survey, approximately 20 to 30% of our graduates go on to graduate school.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        How does the Computer Science program differ between the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS), Columbia College, Barnard, and General Studies?\n\n\n\n\nThe Computer Science major for SEAS students is more rigorous than other colleges. SEAS students take a minimum of 74 to 75 points, whereas Columbia College, Barnard, and General students CS majors pursue the same program with a minimum of 41 to 44 points. These students take more credits toward their college requirements and less towards the major than SEAS students.\nThe courses available and opportunities for research do not differ.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Is it possible to do a double major with an entirely different subject (e.g., English)?\n\n\n\n\nIt may be possible to complete a double major in these circumstances as a Columbia College or General Studies student. Please consult your Advising Dean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        What are the differences between the Computer Science and Computer Engineering degrees?\n\n\n\n\nWhile there is substantial cross-over between the two disciplines, in general, the Computer Science major focuses more on theory, software, and applications, whereas Computer Engineering focuses more on computer hardware, digital system development, and system design.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Does the CS department process undergraduate admissions?\n\n\n\n\nNo, the Office of Undergraduate Admissions processes undergraduate applications. If you have specific questions about admissions, please contact the Office of Undergraduate Admissions.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE APPLICATION PROCESS- BRIDGE, MS, DOCTORAL\n\n\n\n\n\n                        What are the application requirements?\n\n\n\n\nPlease see the official application requirements on the SEAS website here.

Examples of specific research groups are:\n\n\n\nGraphics and User Interfaces\nSecurity; Intrusion Detection\nLanguages & Compilers\nMachine Learning\nSpeech and Natural Language Processing\nNetwork Computing\nSoftware Systems\nVision and Robotics\n\n\n\nA complete list of research groups can be found here.\nColumbia University offers a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. The BA major encourages students to obtain broad exposure to the arts, humanities, and social sciences while providing them with the appropriate Computer Science background necessary for graduate study or a professional career. The BS major encourages students to obtain broad exposure to the engineering core while providing the proper Computer Science background for further activities in academia or industry.\nMost Computer Science program graduates at Columbia step directly into career positions in Computer Science with industry or government or continue their education in graduate degree programs. Many choose to combine Computer Science with a second career interest by taking additional programs in business administration, medicine, or other professional studies. Students graduating from Columbia’s Computer Science Department find themselves well-suited to continue graduate-level studies in top-name institutions.  However, all students who complete the program have the knowledge required to pursue various careers either within the computer industry or elsewhere.\nMany of the CS teaching faculty are leaders in their research field and/or have extensive experience in industry and private sector research labs. CS majors at Columbia have the opportunity to be taught and advised by world-renowned computer scientists who have well-developed collaborative relationships with companies such as Bell Labs, IBM, Lucent, and Microsoft, as well as other leaders in the field.\nFinally, Columbia’s location allows students to take advantage of the proximity to many potential future employers based in New York City and the city’s many cultural attractions.\nThe Computer Science department has many research opportunities available during the academic year– many of the faculty sponsor undergraduate and master’s students for research projects in their groups. Typically, the faculty sponsors the students for credit, but in some cases, projects also provide a stipend. Please see the list of departmental research areas. There are additional Research Opportunities posted online that students can get involved with.\nThere are multiple ways for students to get involved in research as a Columbia student. Current Research Opportunities are posted online. CS Advising also sends research opportunities to students via the student list-serves email. These can be for credit or pay. Additional opportunities are also advertised through the Center for Career Education (CCE). Our Career Placement Officers can assist students with applying for and interviewing for internships and fellowships.\nIn addition to graduate study, our students have gone on to a variety of careers either within the computer industry or elsewhere. Generally, the majority of our graduates have found positions at established computer/software companies (e.g., Microsoft, Google), research labs (e.g., IBM), or Wall Street firms (e.g., Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs). Other graduates have found positions at smaller companies or startups (e.g., foursquare). A few students have gone on to work or study outside of the field of Computer Science, applying their knowledge of the discipline to another field, such as business, medicine, or law. For more information regarding Career Opportunities and placements, click here.\nAccording to a recent survey, approximately 20 to 30% of our graduates go on to graduate school.\nThe Computer Science major for SEAS students is more rigorous than other colleges. SEAS students take a minimum of 74 to 75 points, whereas Columbia College, Barnard, and General students CS majors pursue the same program with a minimum of 41 to 44 points. These students take more credits toward their college requirements and less towards the major than SEAS students.\nThe courses available and opportunities for research do not differ.\nIt may be possible to complete a double major in these circumstances as a Columbia College or General Studies student. Please consult your Advising Dean.\nWhile there is substantial cross-over between the two disciplines, in general, the Computer Science major focuses more on theory, software, and applications, whereas Computer Engineering focuses more on computer hardware, digital system development, and system design.\nNo, the Office of Undergraduate Admissions processes undergraduate applications. If you have specific questions about admissions, please contact the Office of Undergraduate Admissions.\nPlease see the official application requirements on the SEAS website here.

Examples of specific research groups are:\n\n\n\nGraphics and User Interfaces\nSecurity; Intrusion Detection\nLanguages & Compilers\nMachine Learning\nSpeech and Natural Language Processing\nNetwork Computing\nSoftware Systems\nVision and Robotics\n\n\n\nA complete list of research groups can be found here.\nColumbia University offers a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. The BA major encourages students to obtain broad exposure to the arts, humanities, and social sciences while providing them with the appropriate Computer Science background necessary for graduate study or a professional career. The BS major encourages students to obtain broad exposure to the engineering core while providing the proper Computer Science background for further activities in academia or industry.\nMost Computer Science program graduates at Columbia step directly into career positions in Computer Science with industry or government or continue their education in graduate degree programs. Many choose to combine Computer Science with a second career interest by taking additional programs in business administration, medicine, or other professional studies. Students graduating from Columbia’s Computer Science Department find themselves well-suited to continue graduate-level studies in top-name institutions.  However, all students who complete the program have the knowledge required to pursue various careers either within the computer industry or elsewhere.\nMany of the CS teaching faculty are leaders in their research field and/or have extensive experience in industry and private sector research labs. CS majors at Columbia have the opportunity to be taught and advised by world-renowned computer scientists who have well-developed collaborative relationships with companies such as Bell Labs, IBM, Lucent, and Microsoft, as well as other leaders in the field.\nFinally, Columbia’s location allows students to take advantage of the proximity to many potential future employers based in New York City and the city’s many cultural attractions.\nThe Computer Science department has many research opportunities available during the academic year– many of the faculty sponsor undergraduate and master’s students for research projects in their groups. Typically, the faculty sponsors the students for credit, but in some cases, projects also provide a stipend. Please see the list of departmental research areas. There are additional Research Opportunities posted online that students can get involved with.\nThere are multiple ways for students to get involved in research as a Columbia student. Current Research Opportunities are posted online. CS Advising also sends research opportunities to students via the student list-serves email. These can be for credit or pay. Additional opportunities are also advertised through the Center for Career Education (CCE). Our Career Placement Officers can assist students with applying for and interviewing for internships and fellowships.\nIn addition to graduate study, our students have gone on to a variety of careers either within the computer industry or elsewhere. Generally, the majority of our graduates have found positions at established computer/software companies (e.g., Microsoft, Google), research labs (e.g., IBM), or Wall Street firms (e.g., Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs). Other graduates have found positions at smaller companies or startups (e.g., foursquare). A few students have gone on to work or study outside of the field of Computer Science, applying their knowledge of the discipline to another field, such as business, medicine, or law. For more information regarding Career Opportunities and placements, click here.\nAccording to a recent survey, approximately 20 to 30% of our graduates go on to graduate school.\nThe Computer Science major for SEAS students is more rigorous than other colleges. SEAS students take a minimum of 74 to 75 points, whereas Columbia College, Barnard, and General students CS majors pursue the same program with a minimum of 41 to 44 points. These students take more credits toward their college requirements and less towards the major than SEAS students.\nThe courses available and opportunities for research do not differ.\nIt may be possible to complete a double major in these circumstances as a Columbia College or General Studies student. Please consult your Advising Dean.\nWhile there is substantial cross-over between the two disciplines, in general, the Computer Science major focuses more on theory, software, and applications, whereas Computer Engineering focuses more on computer hardware, digital system development, and system design.\nNo, the Office of Undergraduate Admissions processes undergraduate applications. If you have specific questions about admissions, please contact the Office of Undergraduate Admissions.\nPlease see the official application requirements on the SEAS website here.

The faculty in the department conduct research in all areas of computer science. The doctoral degree requires a dissertation based on the candidate’s original research, which is supervised by a faculty member, and all students in the doctioral program are actively engaged in research throughout the program.\nThe PhD is the Computer Science Department’s primary doctoral program.  PhD students are expected to be full-time on-campus during every fall and spring academic semester from initial enrollment until the dissertation has been distributed to their defense committee, except during leaves of absence approved by the university.  PhD students spend at least half of their time on research under the direction of their faculty adviser from their first day in the program and devote themselves full time to research after coursework and other preliminaries have been completed. PhD students are also expected to participate in departmental and laboratory activities full time throughout the program, except possibly for summer internships elsewhere, and the department does not consider admission of part-time PhD students. The policy on outside activities by PhD students is here.\nUnless otherwise stated, all doctoral program requirements apply equally to PhD, MS/PhD (until MS completed, when student becomes PhD) and DES students.\nAnalysis of Algorithms is the core of Computer Science, which unites the many disparate subfields.  All doctoral students are expected to complete an acceptable lecture course (graduate or upper-level undergraduate) in Analysis of Algorithms, with grade B+ or higher, prior to entering the program.  Sometimes new doctoral students are admitted without a prior Analysis of Algorithms course.  Those students are required to complete CSOR W4231 during their first or second semester in the program.  Further details about course requirements are posted here.\nA total of ten distinct courses are required.  All ten courses should be completed by the end of the fifth semester, at the pace of two courses per semester.   An undergraduate Analysis of Algorithms course that satisfies the prerequisite does not satisfy the breadth requirement, only graduate lecture courses can be counted towards the breadth requirement.  B+ (“PhD pass”) is the minimum acceptable grade for doctoral students in all courses.  A grade of B or lower is considered failure and does not count towards the course requirement.  The same course may be repeated until the minimum B+ grade is obtained or a different course substituted. The average grade across all courses applied to the course requirement must be A- or higher. Further details about course requirements are posted here.\nDoctoral students must complete at least four graduate lecture courses from the approved distribution course lists, including at least one from each of the Artificial Intelligence and Applications, Systems and Theory lists, and the fourth from any of these three approved lists.  The currently approved distribution courses are as follows:\nAll COMS 42xx courses except { COMS 429x and CSOR 4246 }CSOR 4231\nFurther details about doctoral course requirements are posted here.\nIn addition to the four distribution courses, doctoral students must complete six elective graduate lecture courses approved by the student’s advisor.  Additional courses from the approved lists, beyond the four needed to satisfy the distribution requirement, may be taken as electives. Most other graduate lecture courses offered by the Computer Science Department (or offered by Computer Science jointly with other departments) may be taken as electives, including topics courses.  At most two of the six electives may be graduate lecture courses offered by other departments besides Computer Science.\nOnly graduate lecture courses are acceptable; project courses and fieldwork courses do not count. Some 4000 level courses, particularly in A&S, may be designated undergraduate – these also do not count.  Make sure all six courses are lecture courses designated graduate level by the offering department.  Further details about course requirements, including exclusions, are posted here.\nAll DES students and most MS/PhD and PhD students arrange a research advisor during the admissions process prior to enrollment, and work closely with him or her on directed research from their first day in the program.  Some doctoral students have two or more co-advisors.  All DES research advisors and most MS/PhD and PhD research advisors are tenured or tenure-track faculty members in the Computer Science Department.  But in rare cases an MS/PhD or PhD student’s research may be advised by a research scientist or an affiliated faculty member from another department, in which case the student must also have a departmental advisor who is a tenured or tenure-track faculty member in Computer Science.  The departmental advisor is responsible for tracking the student’s progress through doctoral program milestones, but is not responsible for the student’s research or funding.  Both rsearch and departmental advisors are expected to represent their students at the Semi-Annual Review of all doctoral students held near the end of the fall and spring semesters.  Further details on the department’s advising policy and Semi-Annual Review are posted here.\nThe primary focus of our doctoral program is research, with the philosophy that students learn best by doing – beginning as apprentices and becoming junior colleagues working with faculty on scholarly research projects.  All doctoral students are required to conduct productive research under the direction of their advisor throughout the program.  For MS/PhD and PhD students, this should be half-time until completion of the coursework, teaching and candidacy exam requirements, and thereafter full-time until distribution of the dissertation.  MS/PhD and PhD students are also expected to participate in departmental and laboratory activities throughout all fall and spring semesters of the program.  The policy on outside activities by MS/PhD and PhD students is here.\nThe directed research requirement is indeed a requirement, never waived, regardless of funding source, including employer-supported DES students.  Insufficient or inadequate research progress is deemed unsatisfactory progress: the doctoral student is normally placed on probation and can be immediately dismissed from the program.  However, on appeal of the student’s advisor, one semester’s grace can be granted by the full faculty.\nThe candidacy exam is an oral exam based on a syllabus prepared jointly by the student and his/her candidacy committee. Admission to candidacy (i.e., passing the exam) certifies that the student has demonstrated a depth of scholarship in the literature and the methods of the student’s chosen area of research, and has demonstrated a facility with the scholarly skills of critical evaluation and verbal expression. The candidacy exam should be completed by the end of the sixth semester or earlier, typically the semester after completing all courses, and must be completed prior to the thesis proposal. More detailed information, including the permitted composition of the candidacy committee, is here.\nDoctoral students are required to register at least two weeks in advance for their Candidacy Exam using the department’s Doctoral Program Milestones Registration Form.  Schedule two hours.  Contact the PhD Program Administrator with any questions about the registration form.\nIn the thesis proposal, the student lays out his or her intended course of research for the dissertation.  If the student passes the written and oral components of the proposal, the thesis proposal committee signs a form to recommend that the candidate proceed.  The proposal should be completed by the end of the eighth semester.  The university’s permitted composition of the dissertation prospectus committee and other requirements for the proposal are specified here.  Additional department-specific requirements are here.\nDoctoral students are required to register at least two weeks in advance for their Thesis Proposal using the department’s Doctoral Program Milestones Registration Form. Schedule two hours.  Contact the PhD Program Administrator with any questions about the registration form.\nThe doctoral dissertation and defense is typically completed during the fifth or sixth year in the program. Some very highly motivated students, particularly in theoretical areas, may finish in less time.  It is important to note, however, that students cannot schedule their defense until after they have completed the en-course MPhil degree.\nVarious forms and instructions for filling out the forms, composition of the dissertation committee, handling of remote participants in the defense, revision and deposit of the dissertation, and many other topics, are available from the GSAS Dissertation Office.  Dissertation formatting requirements, including a latex template, are here.  It’s particularly important for both the student and the advisor(s) to review the university’s detailed requirements here about forming the dissertation committee, distributing the dissertation, and scheduling the defense.\nDefenses are typically accompanied by a public seminar.  The Computer Science department always holds that public seminar immediately before the defense.  When a student schedules their “defense”, they should schedule enough time, at least two hours, for both that public seminar and the official (closed) defense.  The department’s Doctoral Program Milestones Registration Form must be submitted by the student to the department’s PhD Program Administrator at least six weeks in advance of the anticipated defense date.\nAll doctoral students are required to fulfill two “teaching units”, ideally approximately the total workload of half-time for one semester, but the actual workload may vary widely.  Both teaching units must be for courses approved by the department’s Academic Committee as Computer Science courses, where the Computer Science department is responsible for staffing (assigning Instruction Assistants), and occur during a regular academic semester while the student is enrolled in the doctoral program. Most students complete their teaching units during their second or third year, but there are no timing restrictions on which semesters students can do their teaching units.  When students complete their teaching units is determined by their advisor.  More detailed information is here.\nThe Department of Computer Science takes pride in maintaining a well-developed sense of community, and sees as an essential part of its doctoral program the preparation of its students for this important aspect of their future careers.  It therefore strongly encourages students to contribute a year of service to the department’s professional, operational, or social needs, preferably during their second and/or third year in the program. A list of community service positions normally held by doctoral students is available in mice.   The department confers several annual awards recognizing excellence in doctoral student service and teaching; further information and past awardees are here.  The “phd reps” represent doctoral student concerns to the faculty, report on faculty meetings to doctoral students, and find volunteers for the community service program. More information about the current phd reps and what they do is here.\nThe en-course degree of Master of Philosophy (MPhil) is conferred upon a PhD student who has satisfactorily fulfilled all milestones except the proposal and dissertation. This includes all courses, teaching, and candidacy exam. The MPhil also requires completion of six Residency Units (RUs) and sixty graduate points beyond the undergraduate degree.  Two RUs and thirty points of advanced standing are granted for completing the masters degree. See the university requirements for the MPhil.\nLast updated April 11, 2025.\nFind open faculty positions here.\nFriday 2:00 pm\n, CS Careers\nFriday 11:00 am\n, CS Careers\nPresident Bollinger announced that Columbia University along with many other academic institutions (sixteen, including all Ivy League universities) filed an amicus brief in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York challenging the Executive Order regarding immigrants from seven designated countries and refugees. Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”\nThis recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.\nI am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment. We are fortunate to have the privilege to learn from one another, and to study, work, and live together in such a dynamic and vibrant place as Columbia.\nMary C.

Further details about course requirements are posted here. \nDISTRIBUTION COURSES\nDoctoral students must complete at least four graduate lecture courses from the approved distribution course lists, including at least one from each of the Artificial Intelligence and Applications, Systems and Theory lists, and the fourth from any of these three approved lists.  The currently approved distribution courses are as follows:\n\n\n\nArea\nApproved Courses\n\n\nAI & Applications\nAll COMS 47xx courses except { COMS 4721 and 479x }All COMS 416x and COMS 417xCBMF 4761\n\n\nSystems\nAll COMS 41xx courses except { COMS 4121, 416x, 417x, and 419x }All COMS 48xx courses except 489xCOMS 4444CSEE 4119, CSEE 4823, CSEE 4824, CSEE 4840, CSEE 4868EECS 4340 \n\n\nTheory\n\nAll COMS 42xx courses except { COMS 429x and CSOR 4246 }CSOR 4231\n\n\n\n\nFurther details about doctoral course requirements are posted here. \nELECTIVE COURSES\nIn addition to the four distribution courses, doctoral students must complete six elective graduate lecture courses approved by the student’s advisor.  Additional courses from the approved lists, beyond the four needed to satisfy the distribution requirement, may be taken as electives. Most other graduate lecture courses offered by the Computer Science Department (or offered by Computer Science jointly with other departments) may be taken as electives, including topics courses.  At most two of the six electives may be graduate lecture courses offered by other departments besides Computer Science. \nOnly graduate lecture courses are acceptable; project courses and fieldwork courses do not count. Some 4000 level courses, particularly in A&S, may be designated undergraduate – these also do not count.  Make sure all six courses are lecture courses designated graduate level by the offering department.  Further details about course requirements, including exclusions, are posted here. \nRESEARCH:\nADVISOR\nAll DES students and most MS/PhD and PhD students arrange a research advisor during the admissions process prior to enrollment, and work closely with him or her on directed research from their first day in the program.  Some doctoral students have two or more co-advisors.  All DES research advisors and most MS/PhD and PhD research advisors are tenured or tenure-track faculty members in the Computer Science Department.  But in rare cases an MS/PhD or PhD student’s research may be advised by a research scientist or an affiliated faculty member from another department, in which case the student must also have a departmental advisor who is a tenured or tenure-track faculty member in Computer Science.  The departmental advisor is responsible for tracking the student’s progress through doctoral program milestones, but is not responsible for the student’s research or funding.  Both rsearch and departmental advisors are expected to represent their students at the Semi-Annual Review of all doctoral students held near the end of the fall and spring semesters.  Further details on the department’s advising policy and Semi-Annual Review are posted here. \nDIRECTED RESEARCH\nThe primary focus of our doctoral program is research, with the philosophy that students learn best by doing – beginning as apprentices and becoming junior colleagues working with faculty on scholarly research projects.  All doctoral students are required to conduct productive research under the direction of their advisor throughout the program.  For MS/PhD and PhD students, this should be half-time until completion of the coursework, teaching and candidacy exam requirements, and thereafter full-time until distribution of the dissertation.  MS/PhD and PhD students are also expected to participate in departmental and laboratory activities throughout all fall and spring semesters of the program.  The policy on outside activities by MS/PhD and PhD students is here.    \nThe directed research requirement is indeed a requirement, never waived, regardless of funding source, including employer-supported DES students.  Insufficient or inadequate research progress is deemed unsatisfactory progress: the doctoral student is normally placed on probation and can be immediately dismissed from the program.  However, on appeal of the student’s advisor, one semester’s grace can be granted by the full faculty.  \nCANDIDACY EXAM\nThe candidacy exam is an oral exam based on a syllabus prepared jointly by the student and his/her candidacy committee. Admission to candidacy (i.e., passing the exam) certifies that the student has demonstrated a depth of scholarship in the literature and the methods of the student’s chosen area of research, and has demonstrated a facility with the scholarly skills of critical evaluation and verbal expression. The candidacy exam should be completed by the end of the sixth semester or earlier, typically the semester after completing all courses, and must be completed prior to the thesis proposal. More detailed information, including the permitted composition of the candidacy committee, is here.\nDoctoral students are required to register at least two weeks in advance for their Candidacy Exam using the department’s Doctoral Program Milestones Registration Form.  Schedule two hours.  Contact the PhD Program Administrator with any questions about the registration form. \nTHESIS PROPOSAL\nIn the thesis proposal, the student lays out his or her intended course of research for the dissertation.  If the student passes the written and oral components of the proposal, the thesis proposal committee signs a form to recommend that the candidate proceed.  The proposal should be completed by the end of the eighth semester.  The university’s permitted composition of the dissertation prospectus committee and other requirements for the proposal are specified here.  Additional department-specific requirements are here.\nDoctoral students are required to register at least two weeks in advance for their Thesis Proposal using the department’s Doctoral Program Milestones Registration Form. Schedule two hours.  Contact the PhD Program Administrator with any questions about the registration form. \nDISSERTATION AND DEFENSE\nThe doctoral dissertation and defense is typically completed during the fifth or sixth year in the program. Some very highly motivated students, particularly in theoretical areas, may finish in less time.  It is important to note, however, that students cannot schedule their defense until after they have completed the en-course MPhil degree.\nVarious forms and instructions for filling out the forms, composition of the dissertation committee, handling of remote participants in the defense, revision and deposit of the dissertation, and many other topics, are available from the GSAS Dissertation Office.  Dissertation formatting requirements, including a latex template, are here.  It’s particularly important for both the student and the advisor(s) to review the university’s detailed requirements here about forming the dissertation committee, distributing the dissertation, and scheduling the defense.  \nDefenses are typically accompanied by a public seminar.  The Computer Science department always holds that public seminar immediately before the defense.  When a student schedules their “defense”, they should schedule enough time, at least two hours, for both that public seminar and the official (closed) defense.  The department’s Doctoral Program Milestones Registration Form must be submitted by the student to the department’s PhD Program Administrator at least six weeks in advance of the anticipated defense date.  \nOTHER REQUIREMENTS:\nTEACHING\nAll doctoral students are required to fulfill two “teaching units”, ideally approximately the total workload of half-time for one semester, but the actual workload may vary widely.  Both teaching units must be for courses approved by the department’s Academic Committee as Computer Science courses, where the Computer Science department is responsible for staffing (assigning Instruction Assistants), and occur during a regular academic semester while the student is enrolled in the doctoral program. Most students complete their teaching units during their second or third year, but there are no timing restrictions on which semesters students can do their teaching units.  When students complete their teaching units is determined by their advisor.  More detailed information is here.\nCOMMUNITY SERVICE\nThe Department of Computer Science takes pride in maintaining a well-developed sense of community, and sees as an essential part of its doctoral program the preparation of its students for this important aspect of their future careers.  It therefore strongly encourages students to contribute a year of service to the department’s professional, operational, or social needs, preferably during their second and/or third year in the program. A list of community service positions normally held by doctoral students is available in mice.   The department confers several annual awards recognizing excellence in doctoral student service and teaching; further information and past awardees are here.  The “phd reps” represent doctoral student concerns to the faculty, report on faculty meetings to doctoral students, and find volunteers for the community service program. More information about the current phd reps and what they do is here. \nMPHIL FOR PHD STUDENTS\nThe en-course degree of Master of Philosophy (MPhil) is conferred upon a PhD student who has satisfactorily fulfilled all milestones except the proposal and dissertation. This includes all courses, teaching, and candidacy exam. The MPhil also requires completion of six Residency Units (RUs) and sixty graduate points beyond the undergraduate degree.  Two RUs and thirty points of advanced standing are granted for completing the masters degree. See the university requirements for the MPhil.\nLast updated April 11, 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind open faculty positions here.\n\n\nComputer Science at Columbia University\n\n\n\n\n\nUpcoming Events\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                   Sep                                           \n\n                                   12                                           \n\n\n\nCS Career Advising Walk-In Hours\n\nFriday 2:00 pm\nCS Lounge\n, CS Careers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                   Sep                                           \n\n                                   19                                           \n\n\n\nCS Career Advising Walk-In Hours\n\nFriday 11:00 am\nCS Lounge\n, CS Careers\n\n\n\n\nView All >>\n\n\n\nIn the News\n\n\n\n\nPress Mentions\nThe primary focus of the doctoral program is research, with the philosophy that students learn best by doing—beginning as apprentices and becoming junior colleagues working with faculty on scholarly research projects.

Some 4000 level courses, particularly in A&S, may be designated undergraduate – these also do not count.  Make sure all six courses are lecture courses designated graduate level by the offering department.  Further details about course requirements, including exclusions, are posted here. \nRESEARCH:\nADVISOR\nAll DES students and most MS/PhD and PhD students arrange a research advisor during the admissions process prior to enrollment, and work closely with him or her on directed research from their first day in the program.  Some doctoral students have two or more co-advisors.  All DES research advisors and most MS/PhD and PhD research advisors are tenured or tenure-track faculty members in the Computer Science Department.  But in rare cases an MS/PhD or PhD student’s research may be advised by a research scientist or an affiliated faculty member from another department, in which case the student must also have a departmental advisor who is a tenured or tenure-track faculty member in Computer Science.  The departmental advisor is responsible for tracking the student’s progress through doctoral program milestones, but is not responsible for the student’s research or funding.  Both rsearch and departmental advisors are expected to represent their students at the Semi-Annual Review of all doctoral students held near the end of the fall and spring semesters.  Further details on the department’s advising policy and Semi-Annual Review are posted here. \nDIRECTED RESEARCH\nThe primary focus of our doctoral program is research, with the philosophy that students learn best by doing – beginning as apprentices and becoming junior colleagues working with faculty on scholarly research projects.  All doctoral students are required to conduct productive research under the direction of their advisor throughout the program.  For MS/PhD and PhD students, this should be half-time until completion of the coursework, teaching and candidacy exam requirements, and thereafter full-time until distribution of the dissertation.  MS/PhD and PhD students are also expected to participate in departmental and laboratory activities throughout all fall and spring semesters of the program.  The policy on outside activities by MS/PhD and PhD students is here.    \nThe directed research requirement is indeed a requirement, never waived, regardless of funding source, including employer-supported DES students.  Insufficient or inadequate research progress is deemed unsatisfactory progress: the doctoral student is normally placed on probation and can be immediately dismissed from the program.  However, on appeal of the student’s advisor, one semester’s grace can be granted by the full faculty.  \nCANDIDACY EXAM\nThe candidacy exam is an oral exam based on a syllabus prepared jointly by the student and his/her candidacy committee. Admission to candidacy (i.e., passing the exam) certifies that the student has demonstrated a depth of scholarship in the literature and the methods of the student’s chosen area of research, and has demonstrated a facility with the scholarly skills of critical evaluation and verbal expression. The candidacy exam should be completed by the end of the sixth semester or earlier, typically the semester after completing all courses, and must be completed prior to the thesis proposal. More detailed information, including the permitted composition of the candidacy committee, is here.\nDoctoral students are required to register at least two weeks in advance for their Candidacy Exam using the department’s Doctoral Program Milestones Registration Form.  Schedule two hours.  Contact the PhD Program Administrator with any questions about the registration form. \nTHESIS PROPOSAL\nIn the thesis proposal, the student lays out his or her intended course of research for the dissertation.  If the student passes the written and oral components of the proposal, the thesis proposal committee signs a form to recommend that the candidate proceed.  The proposal should be completed by the end of the eighth semester.  The university’s permitted composition of the dissertation prospectus committee and other requirements for the proposal are specified here.  Additional department-specific requirements are here.\nDoctoral students are required to register at least two weeks in advance for their Thesis Proposal using the department’s Doctoral Program Milestones Registration Form. Schedule two hours.  Contact the PhD Program Administrator with any questions about the registration form. \nDISSERTATION AND DEFENSE\nThe doctoral dissertation and defense is typically completed during the fifth or sixth year in the program. Some very highly motivated students, particularly in theoretical areas, may finish in less time.  It is important to note, however, that students cannot schedule their defense until after they have completed the en-course MPhil degree.\nVarious forms and instructions for filling out the forms, composition of the dissertation committee, handling of remote participants in the defense, revision and deposit of the dissertation, and many other topics, are available from the GSAS Dissertation Office.  Dissertation formatting requirements, including a latex template, are here.  It’s particularly important for both the student and the advisor(s) to review the university’s detailed requirements here about forming the dissertation committee, distributing the dissertation, and scheduling the defense.  \nDefenses are typically accompanied by a public seminar.  The Computer Science department always holds that public seminar immediately before the defense.  When a student schedules their “defense”, they should schedule enough time, at least two hours, for both that public seminar and the official (closed) defense.  The department’s Doctoral Program Milestones Registration Form must be submitted by the student to the department’s PhD Program Administrator at least six weeks in advance of the anticipated defense date.  \nOTHER REQUIREMENTS:\nTEACHING\nAll doctoral students are required to fulfill two “teaching units”, ideally approximately the total workload of half-time for one semester, but the actual workload may vary widely.  Both teaching units must be for courses approved by the department’s Academic Committee as Computer Science courses, where the Computer Science department is responsible for staffing (assigning Instruction Assistants), and occur during a regular academic semester while the student is enrolled in the doctoral program. Most students complete their teaching units during their second or third year, but there are no timing restrictions on which semesters students can do their teaching units.  When students complete their teaching units is determined by their advisor.  More detailed information is here.\nCOMMUNITY SERVICE\nThe Department of Computer Science takes pride in maintaining a well-developed sense of community, and sees as an essential part of its doctoral program the preparation of its students for this important aspect of their future careers.  It therefore strongly encourages students to contribute a year of service to the department’s professional, operational, or social needs, preferably during their second and/or third year in the program. A list of community service positions normally held by doctoral students is available in mice.   The department confers several annual awards recognizing excellence in doctoral student service and teaching; further information and past awardees are here.  The “phd reps” represent doctoral student concerns to the faculty, report on faculty meetings to doctoral students, and find volunteers for the community service program. More information about the current phd reps and what they do is here. \nMPHIL FOR PHD STUDENTS\nThe en-course degree of Master of Philosophy (MPhil) is conferred upon a PhD student who has satisfactorily fulfilled all milestones except the proposal and dissertation. This includes all courses, teaching, and candidacy exam. The MPhil also requires completion of six Residency Units (RUs) and sixty graduate points beyond the undergraduate degree.  Two RUs and thirty points of advanced standing are granted for completing the masters degree. See the university requirements for the MPhil.\nLast updated April 11, 2025.\nFind open faculty positions here.\n\n\nComputer Science at Columbia University\n\n\n\n\n\nUpcoming Events\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                   Sep                                           \n\n                                   12                                           \n\n\n\nCS Career Advising Walk-In Hours\n\nFriday 2:00 pm\nCS Lounge\n, CS Careers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                   Sep                                           \n\n                                   19                                           \n\n\n\nCS Career Advising Walk-In Hours\n\nFriday 11:00 am\nCS Lounge\n, CS Careers\n\n\n\n\nView All >>\n\n\n\nIn the News\n\n\n\n\nPress Mentions\nFind open faculty positions here.\nComputer Science at Columbia University\nUpcoming Events\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                   Sep                                           \n\n                                   12                                           \n\n\n\nCS Career Advising Walk-In Hours\n\nFriday 2:00 pm\nCS Lounge\n, CS Careers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                   Sep                                           \n\n                                   19                                           \n\n\n\nCS Career Advising Walk-In Hours\n\nFriday 11:00 am\nCS Lounge\n, CS Careers\n\n\n\n\nView All >>\nSep                                           \n\n                                   12                                           \n\n\n\nCS Career Advising Walk-In Hours\n\nFriday 2:00 pm\nCS Lounge\n, CS Careers\nSep                                           \n\n                                   12\nCS Career Advising Walk-In Hours\n\nFriday 2:00 pm\nCS Lounge\n, CS Careers\nSep                                           \n\n                                   19                                           \n\n\n\nCS Career Advising Walk-In Hours\n\nFriday 11:00 am\nCS Lounge\n, CS Careers\nSep                                           \n\n                                   19\nCS Career Advising Walk-In Hours\n\nFriday 11:00 am\nCS Lounge\n, CS Careers\nIn the News\nPress Mentions\n[GRID_TABLE]\nFind open faculty positions here.\nComputer Science at Columbia University\nUpcoming Events\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                   Sep                                           \n\n                                   12                                           \n\n\n\nCS Career Advising Walk-In Hours\n\nFriday 2:00 pm\nCS Lounge\n, CS Careers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                   Sep                                           \n\n                                   19                                           \n\n\n\nCS Career Advising Walk-In Hours\n\nFriday 11:00 am\nCS Lounge\n, CS Careers\n\n\n\n\nView All >>\nSep                                           \n\n                                   12                                           \n\n\n\nCS Career Advising Walk-In Hours\n\nFriday 2:00 pm\nCS Lounge\n, CS Careers\nSep                                           \n\n                                   12\nCS Career Advising Walk-In Hours\n\nFriday 2:00 pm\nCS Lounge\n, CS Careers\nSep                                           \n\n                                   19                                           \n\n\n\nCS Career Advising Walk-In Hours\n\nFriday 11:00 am\nCS Lounge\n, CS Careers\nSep                                           \n\n                                   19\nCS Career Advising Walk-In Hours\n\nFriday 11:00 am\nCS Lounge\n, CS Careers\nIn the News\nPress Mentions\n[GRID_TABLE]\nSep                                           \n\n                                   12\nCS Career Advising Walk-In Hours\n\nFriday 2:00 pm\nCS Lounge\n, CS Careers\n[GRID_TABLE]\nSep                                           \n\n                                   19\nCS Career Advising Walk-In Hours\n\nFriday 11:00 am\nCS Lounge\n, CS Careers",

The program offers the highest caliber of Computer Science and Journalism training available at Columbia University. Students will earn MS degrees in both Computer Science and Journalism.\nExplore the frontiers of journalism with cutting-edge tools and techniques! The dual degree program in Journalism and Computer Science prepares students for robust opportunities in both fields, including designing and building platforms, algorithms, and applications for journalism or pursuing research and development work in computer science related to journalism, natural language processing, and the digital humanities.\nOur goal is to train a new generation of journalistically literate Computer Scientists (or computationally literate journalists) who will redefine journalism as we know it.\nStudents enroll for a total of four semesters at the Journalism and Engineering schools, learning the fundamentals of reporting and writing while developing technical skills in Computer Science and Software Design. In addition to taking classes already offered at the Journalism and Engineering schools, students will attend a Seminar and Workshop designed specifically for the Dual Degree program. The Seminar will teach students about the impact of digital techniques on journalism; the emerging role of citizens in the news process; the influence of social media; and the changing business models that will support newsgathering.\nIn the Workshop, students will use a hands-on approach to delve deeply into information design, focusing on how to build a site, section, or application from concept to development, ensuring the editorial goals are kept uppermost in mind. Students will also engage in projects supervised jointly by professors in Computer Science and Journalism to obtain hands-on experiential learning.\nThe Dual MS in Journalism and Computer Science program seeks applicants with outstanding undergraduate records, including a strong background in computer science and extensive mathematics or engineering training. Equally important: applicants should have excellent writing skills and be familiar with the fundamentals of reporting. Graduates will be poised to become leaders in digital media production and innovation.\nApplicants must be accepted into both the Journalism School and the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science.\nAdditional information for Journalism Admission requirements can be found here, while additional information for the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science can be found here.\nTo help students manage their registration and course requirements, the Computer Science and Journalism Faculty Advisors will meet with dual degree students twice per year—in early April and late October—to plan the next semester’s schedules.\nOne week after each of these meetings, Track Graduation Documents should be completed and submitted to CS Advising.\nIf you have questions about picking CS courses to take or the CS requirements that you cannot find answers to below, please email the CS Faculty Advisor for the Dual Degree program, Professor Wu.\nIf you have questions about the CS registration process or general CS questions, please contact CS Advising.\nIf you have questions about the Journalism part of the program, please visit the Journalism website to see journalism requirements or email the Journalism Faculty Advisor for the Dual Degree program, Professor Mehta.\nTo fulfill the CS Requirements, dual-degree students must:\nComputer Science courses are organized into three categories: core, required, and electives. Core classes are meant to ensure a strong computer science foundation for all graduates, required courses allow students to branch out and learn advanced topics in-depth, and electives are often seminar or project-based courses that allow more freedom within a topic. See below for details about each category.\nStudents must take four courses from the following six to satisfy the Core Requirement:\nCore Computer Science courses may be waived or tested out of if you have taken an equivalent course in the past and can demonstrate a strong grasp of the content.\nIn order to waive courses, you must receive approval from the instructor teaching the Columbia equivalent course. This can be done in two ways: first, by importing the course on Mice. To import a course and apply for a waiver, you must attach the syllabus from the course you previously took and your transcript to demonstrate you earned a B or higher. You then must match your course to a Columbia equivalent course. Mice will then automatically send your import request to the applicable instructor for their review.\nThe second way to obtain a course waiver is by reaching out to the instructor of the Columbia equivalent course directly through email and attaching the applicable syllabi and transcript(s) from your previous course(s). If the instructor approves, then you must forward that email to CS Advising so we can make note of any approvals.\nYou may also test out of certain Core Requirements by taking the final exam and earning above a B+.\nFor questions regarding course waivers and how to test out of select courses, please contact CS Advising.\nIf you have taken a CS course at Columbia that has not counted towards a prior degree at Columbia, then please contact CS Advising to learn more about how to transfer the points toward the Dual Degree by applying for Advanced Standing.\nStudents must take three of the following 4xxx-level courses to satisfy the Track Course requirement. If you are interested in a 4995 topics course, please consult the “Journalism+CS” column here: http://www.cs.columbia.edu/education/ms/topics-courses/. Courses with an “x” have been pre-approved. Courses with “no” have been explicitly not approved. In all other cases, please email your CS Faculty Advisor to ensure the course is applicable to your degree.\nCourses that satisfy Core requirements are also acceptable for the required Track Courses.\nStudents must take two of the following 6xxx-level courses to satisfy the Track Elective course requirement. If you are interested in a 6998 topics course, please consult the “Journalism+CS” column here: http://www.cs.columbia.edu/education/ms/topics-courses/. Courses with an “x” have been pre-approved. Courses with “no” have been explicitly not approved. In all other cases, please contact the CS advisor to ensure the course is applicable to the degree.\nCourses that satisfy Core or Required Track requirements are also acceptable for the Elective Track.\nPlease visit the Journalism website to see journalism requirements. If you have any Journalism-specific questions, email the Journalism Faculty Advisor for the Dual Degree program, Professor Mehta.\nSome topics have multiple equivalent courses that you may take. For example, COMS W4771 and COMS W4721 have significant content overlap, and either course can be taken to fulfill the Machine Learning required track course, even though the above guide suggests COMS W4771. To assess whether a course you are interested in is equivalent to a required course, please consult the CS MS Track pages.\nWhen registering for classes, please keep in mind that:\nDual Degree students preparing for graduation should submit a track graduation form/Checklist to CS Advising (an example of a completed form is available).\nFind open faculty positions here.\nFriday 2:00 pm\n, CS Careers\nFriday 11:00 am\n, CS Careers\nPresident Bollinger announced that Columbia University along with many other academic institutions (sixteen, including all Ivy League universities) filed an amicus brief in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York challenging the Executive Order regarding immigrants from seven designated countries and refugees. Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”\nThis recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.\nI am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment. We are fortunate to have the privilege to learn from one another, and to study, work, and live together in such a dynamic and vibrant place as Columbia.\nMary C.

The program offers the highest caliber of Computer Science and Journalism training available at Columbia University. Students will earn MS degrees in both Computer Science and Journalism.\n\n\nPROGRAM OVERVIEW\nExplore the frontiers of journalism with cutting-edge tools and techniques! The dual degree program in Journalism and Computer Science prepares students for robust opportunities in both fields, including designing and building platforms, algorithms, and applications for journalism or pursuing research and development work in computer science related to journalism, natural language processing, and the digital humanities.\n\nOur goal is to train a new generation of journalistically literate Computer Scientists (or computationally literate journalists) who will redefine journalism as we know it.\n\n\nStudents enroll for a total of four semesters at the Journalism and Engineering schools, learning the fundamentals of reporting and writing while developing technical skills in Computer Science and Software Design. In addition to taking classes already offered at the Journalism and Engineering schools, students will attend a Seminar and Workshop designed specifically for the Dual Degree program. The Seminar will teach students about the impact of digital techniques on journalism; the emerging role of citizens in the news process; the influence of social media; and the changing business models that will support newsgathering.\nIn the Workshop, students will use a hands-on approach to delve deeply into information design, focusing on how to build a site, section, or application from concept to development, ensuring the editorial goals are kept uppermost in mind. Students will also engage in projects supervised jointly by professors in Computer Science and Journalism to obtain hands-on experiential learning.\n\nWHO SHOULD APPLY?\nThe Dual MS in Journalism and Computer Science program seeks applicants with outstanding undergraduate records, including a strong background in computer science and extensive mathematics or engineering training. Equally important: applicants should have excellent writing skills and be familiar with the fundamentals of reporting. Graduates will be poised to become leaders in digital media production and innovation.\nApplicants must be accepted into both the Journalism School and the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science.\nAdditional information for Journalism Admission requirements can be found here, while additional information for the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science can be found here.\nSTILL HAVE ADMISSIONS QUESTIONS?

The program offers the highest caliber of Computer Science and Journalism training available at Columbia University. Students will earn MS degrees in both Computer Science and Journalism.\n\n\nPROGRAM OVERVIEW\nExplore the frontiers of journalism with cutting-edge tools and techniques! The dual degree program in Journalism and Computer Science prepares students for robust opportunities in both fields, including designing and building platforms, algorithms, and applications for journalism or pursuing research and development work in computer science related to journalism, natural language processing, and the digital humanities.\n\nOur goal is to train a new generation of journalistically literate Computer Scientists (or computationally literate journalists) who will redefine journalism as we know it.\n\n\nStudents enroll for a total of four semesters at the Journalism and Engineering schools, learning the fundamentals of reporting and writing while developing technical skills in Computer Science and Software Design. In addition to taking classes already offered at the Journalism and Engineering schools, students will attend a Seminar and Workshop designed specifically for the Dual Degree program. The Seminar will teach students about the impact of digital techniques on journalism; the emerging role of citizens in the news process; the influence of social media; and the changing business models that will support newsgathering.\nIn the Workshop, students will use a hands-on approach to delve deeply into information design, focusing on how to build a site, section, or application from concept to development, ensuring the editorial goals are kept uppermost in mind. Students will also engage in projects supervised jointly by professors in Computer Science and Journalism to obtain hands-on experiential learning.\n\nWHO SHOULD APPLY?\nThe Dual MS in Journalism and Computer Science program seeks applicants with outstanding undergraduate records, including a strong background in computer science and extensive mathematics or engineering training. Equally important: applicants should have excellent writing skills and be familiar with the fundamentals of reporting. Graduates will be poised to become leaders in digital media production and innovation.\nApplicants must be accepted into both the Journalism School and the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science.\nAdditional information for Journalism Admission requirements can be found here, while additional information for the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science can be found here.\nSTILL HAVE ADMISSIONS QUESTIONS? EMAIL US!\n\nCS Admissions Question\nJournalism Admissions Question\n\n\n\nADVISING\nTo help students manage their registration and course requirements, the Computer Science and Journalism Faculty Advisors will meet with dual degree students twice per year—in early April and late October—to plan the next semester’s schedules.\nOne week after each of these meetings, Track Graduation Documents should be completed and submitted to CS Advising.\nIf you have questions about picking CS courses to take or the CS requirements that you cannot find answers to below, please email the CS Faculty Advisor for the Dual Degree program, Professor Wu.\nIf you have questions about the CS registration process or general CS questions, please contact CS Advising.\nIf you have questions about the Journalism part of the program, please visit the Journalism website to see journalism requirements or email the Journalism Faculty Advisor for the Dual Degree program, Professor Mehta.\n\n\nCS Faculty Advisor\nCS Advising\nJournalism Faculty Advisor\n\n\n\nCS REQUIREMENTS\nTo fulfill the CS Requirements, dual-degree students must:\n\nEarn a total of 27 Computer Science points\nMaintain at least a 2.7 overall GPA in CS coursework\n\nComputer Science courses are organized into three categories: core, required, and electives. Core classes are meant to ensure a strong computer science foundation for all graduates, required courses allow students to branch out and learn advanced topics in-depth, and electives are often seminar or project-based courses that allow more freedom within a topic. See below for details about each category.\n\n\n\n\n                        Core Requirement\n\n\n\n\nStudents must take four courses from the following six to satisfy the Core Requirement:\n\n\n\nCourse ID\nCourse Title\n\n\nCOMS W4111\nIntroduction to Databases\n\n\nCOMS W4115\nProgramming Language and Translators\n\n\nCOMS W4156\nAdvanced Software Engineering\n\n\nCOMS W4170\nUser Interface Design\n\n\nCSOR W4231\nAnalysis of Algorithms\n\n\nCOMS W4701\nArtificial Intelligence\n\n\n\nWAIVING CORE REQUIREMENTS\nCore Computer Science courses may be waived or tested out of if you have taken an equivalent course in the past and can demonstrate a strong grasp of the content.\nIn order to waive courses, you must receive approval from the instructor teaching the Columbia equivalent course. This can be done in two ways: first, by importing the course on Mice. To import a course and apply for a waiver, you must attach the syllabus from the course you previously took and your transcript to demonstrate you earned a B or higher. You then must match your course to a Columbia equivalent course. Mice will then automatically send your import request to the applicable instructor for their review.\nThe second way to obtain a course waiver is by reaching out to the instructor of the Columbia equivalent course directly through email and attaching the applicable syllabi and transcript(s) from your previous course(s). If the instructor approves, then you must forward that email to CS Advising so we can make note of any approvals.\nYou may also test out of certain Core Requirements by taking the final exam and earning above a B+.\nFor questions regarding course waivers and how to test out of select courses, please contact CS Advising.\nIf you have taken a CS course at Columbia that has not counted towards a prior degree at Columbia, then please contact CS Advising to learn more about how to transfer the points toward the Dual Degree by applying for Advanced Standing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Required Track Courses\n\n\n\n\nStudents must take three of the following 4xxx-level courses to satisfy the Track Course requirement. If you are interested in a 4995 topics course, please consult the “Journalism+CS” column here: http://www.cs.columbia.edu/education/ms/topics-courses/. Courses with an “x” have been pre-approved. Courses with “no” have been explicitly not approved.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”\nThis recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.\nI am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment. We are fortunate to have the privilege to learn from one another, and to study, work, and live together in such a dynamic and vibrant place as Columbia.\nMary C.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”\nThis recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.\nI am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment. We are fortunate to have the privilege to learn from one another, and to study, work, and live together in such a dynamic and vibrant place as Columbia.\nMary C.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”\nThis recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.\nI am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment. We are fortunate to have the privilege to learn from one another, and to study, work, and live together in such a dynamic and vibrant place as Columbia.\nMary C.

Among other things, the brief asserts that “safety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities.”\nThis recent action provides a moment for us to collectively reflect on our community within Columbia Engineering and the importance of our commitment to maintaining an open and welcoming community for all students, faculty, researchers and administrative staff. As a School of Engineering and Applied Science, we are fortunate to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds, from across the country, and from around the world. It is a great benefit to be able to gather engineers and scientists of so many different perspectives and talents – all with a commitment to learning, a focus on pushing the frontiers of knowledge and discovery, and with a passion for translating our work to impact humanity.\nI am proud of our community, and wish to take this opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to maintaining an open and collegial environment. We are fortunate to have the privilege to learn from one another, and to study, work, and live together in such a dynamic and vibrant place as Columbia.\nMary C.
