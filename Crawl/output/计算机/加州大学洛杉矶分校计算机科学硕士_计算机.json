MEngr program is a new, one-year program. The MENG degree addresses the needs of both students and industry, tailored to those who wish to pursue technical management positions. Both MSCS and MENG programs include a capstone project with technological concentration. \nCan I apply to both programs since they are housed in different departments?No, you may only apply to one program. \nWhat are the differences between the MEng program and the MSCS program? The Department of Computer Science Master Program (MCSC) is a 2-year program that has existed for over 50 years.  The Master of Engineering Program (MENG) is a 1-year program that is starting its 2nd year.\nNumber of Applications for 2022 Admissions Cycle\n\nMCSC (MS program in the Computer Science Department) had over 4000 applications and 150 offers were made. \nMENG (MEng program in School of Engineering) had 573 applications and 220 offers were made.\n\nCapstone MENG Capstone topic is selected by the course instructor.\nMSCS Capstone topic is student-driven in which the students decide the topic and find their capstone advisor (must be CS faculty). The MSCS Capstone project is advised by faculty in the Department of Computer Science.  \nThesisStudents in the MSCS program (Master’s in Computer Science) could choose a thesis option, instead of Capstone. The MS thesis option is designed to provide in-depth research opportunities with CS faculty. MENG does not provide a thesis option.\nGRE Requirement for Fall 2025-2026 Admissions Cycle Only\nStudents who wish to apply for admission to our graduate program for the 2025-2026 academic year (applications for this cycle are due December 15, 2024) are not required to take the GRE or submit a GRE score report as part of their application package. However, students may voluntarily submit GRE test scores and they will be reviewed as part of the holistic application consideration. The applications with GRE scores will not be given greater weight than those that do not include scores.",

Applicants should have the necessary academic preparation to complete graduate level courses in Computer Science.\nDegrees which are not considered comparable include those granted on the basis of work completed at institutions which are not fully accredited and those granted on the basis of nonacademic prior learning, test scores, or other than organized supervised coursework in academic subjects.\nAn international student whose post-secondary education is completed outside of the U.S. is expected to hold a degree representing completion of at least four years of study with above average/very good scholarship from a university or university-level institution.\nInternational applicants must meet the university’s minimum requirement for the TOEFL or IELTS. Please visit this page for detailed information. Conditional admission is not offered and a transitional or pre-master’s program is not available.\nThe university requires a cumulative GPA of at least 3.0 for consideration. The department reviews all applicants who have earned a cumulative GPA of at least 3.0. The most competitive applicants have an undergraduate cumulative GPA of at least 3.5 (on a 4.00 scale),and at least a 3.50 in any graduate study. The average cumulative GPA of admitted applicants is 3.60.\nStaff in the Computer Science Graduate Student Affairs Office review and convert, as necessary, the marks or grades of all applicants. The Graduate Division online application asks applicants to submit their grade point average on the scale used by their institutions.\nThe department does not provide “pre-application” reviews. Prospective applicants should review this page, frequently asked questions, and the department’s annual report to determine their admission competitiveness, and academic and research fit with the university.\nStudents may apply for either the Ph.D. program or the M.S. program but not both. Admission to the Ph.D. program is more selective than for the M.S. program. In general, the admissions committee does not consider Ph.D. applicants for admission into the M.S. program and vice versa. While a Ph.D. degree prepares students not only for careers in research and academia, those who apply for a Ph.D. degree typically demonstrate significant achievement in and/or potential for advancing knowledge through independent research and teaching.\nWhile a M.S. degree prepares students not only for careers in the industry, those who apply for an M.S degree typically demonstrate interest in developing and applying technical skills and translational knowledge. M.S. applicants should be aware that the selection process is rigorous for M.S. students who later apply for admission into the Ph.D. program.\nApplicants who hold a master’s degree in computer science or a closely related discipline will not be considered for admission to the master’s program. Applicants who hold only a bachelor’s degree may apply to the Ph.D. program. In recent years, the majority of PhD admittees have completed only a bachelor’s degree.\nAt least THREE (3) letters of recommendation must be submitted using the graduate application link above. You will be asked to enter the names and emails of your recommenders in the application. They will then receive a link to submit their recommendations.\nFor M.S. applicants: We recommend that you provide letters of reference from professors who have taught you in your junior and senior years.\nIf you are an ESAP applicant to the CS MS program, you will need two letters of rec from CS faculty/instructors or instructors from outside the department that have a joint appointment with the UCLA CS Dept (i.e. Professors Achuta Kadambi and Mani Srivastava are ECE faculty with joint appointments with the CS Dept). If the faculty member does not have a joint appointment with the UCLA CS Dept they cannot serve as one of your two letters of rec for the CS M program as an ESAP applicant.\nFor Ph.D. applicants: We urge that all your letters be from academic or professional references as recent as possible and from people who can comment on your recent professional accomplishments and your qualifications for graduate study in Computer Science. If you have an M.S. degree, letters from professors who have served on your M.S. committee are particularly helpful.\nLetters are due December 15. We will make every effort to review late letters received by December 15, but we cannot guarantee that they will be included in the review.\nAll applicants are required to upload ONE (1) official transcript from each post-secondary institution attended. Official transcripts should be uploaded to your online application only. Only if you are officially offered admissions into our program will you send us your final official transcript/degree certificate/diplomas.\nApplicants who are attending or have graduated from a U.S. institution that transmits transcripts electronically may request to have official transcripts emailed to: gradadm@cs.ucla.edu but can also upload the official transcript in their online application.\nOfficial transcripts are defined as original documents issued by the institution that bear the actual signature of the Registrar — not a photocopy — and the seal of the issuing institution. Do not, however, send the original of an academic record that cannot be replaced; upload a properly certified copy instead.\nInternational applicants should refer to the “Requirements for International Students” section of the Graduate Division webpage for information about submission of foreign academic records. We do not request or review WES evaluations.\nMost applicants are in the process of completing a degree. If offered admission, the final transcript indicating the date of the degree conferral may be submitted during the summer. Applicants from India and China who have graduated must submit official copies of their degree certificates along with their final official transcripts and diploma:\nIf you are receiving your bachelor’s degree from a university in China\nIf your bachelor’s degree has been awarded, please upload your final official transcripts both in English and Chinese (make sure the GPA scale is included when you upload these documents), the official degree certificate both in English and Chinese and the official diploma in both English and Chinese in your online application.\nIf you are still enrolled and have not been awarded your degree from your university in China, please be sure to upload your latest official transcripts both in English and Chinese in your online admissions application (make sure your university’s GPA scale is included when you upload these documents).\nIf you are receiving your bachelor’s degree from a university in India\nIf you have received your bachelor’s degree from a university in India, please be sure to upload a copy of your final official transcripts along with a copy of your official diploma that shows when your degree was officially conferred and awarded.\nPlease note the conferral certificate is NOT the same as the official diploma.\nIf you have not been awarded your degree and are still enrolled in a university in India, please be sure to upload a copy of your official transcripts in your online admissions application (make sure your university’s GPA scale is included when you upload these documents).\nIf you are receiving your bachelor’s Degree from a University outside the U.S. (and not from India and China)\nIf you have been awarded your degree, please be sure to upload your official transcript both in English and the native language from the country the university is located in, and a copy of your official diploma both in English and the native official language from the country the university you attended in your online application.\nIf you are currently enrolled and have not been awarded your degree from your university, please be sure to upload your official transcripts in both English and the native official language from the country the university you are attending in your online application (make sure your university’s GPA scale is included when you upload these documents).\nOfficial transcripts are due December 15 along with the application (officially transcripts should be uploaded in your graduate application before you submit the application).

Most questions can be answered by simply reviewing or searching a topic, such as GRE, TOEFL, official transcripts, personal statement, letters of recommendation, and document status on the above webpages.\nBachelor's Degree\nThe general requirement for admission for a U.S. student is a bachelor’s degree from a regionally accredited institution, comparable in standard and content to a bachelor’s degree from the University of California. Applicants should have the necessary academic preparation to complete graduate level courses in Computer Science.\nDegrees which are not considered comparable include those granted on the basis of work completed at institutions which are not fully accredited and those granted on the basis of nonacademic prior learning, test scores, or other than organized supervised coursework in academic subjects.\nAn international student whose post-secondary education is completed outside of the U.S. is expected to hold a degree representing completion of at least four years of study with above average/very good scholarship from a university or university-level institution.\nEnglish Proficiency\nInternational applicants must meet the university’s minimum requirement for the TOEFL or IELTS. Please visit this page for detailed information. Conditional admission is not offered and a transitional or pre-master’s program is not available.\nGrade Point Average (GPA)\nThe university requires a cumulative GPA of at least 3.0 for consideration. The department reviews all applicants who have earned a cumulative GPA of at least 3.0. The most competitive applicants have an undergraduate cumulative GPA of at least 3.5 (on a 4.00 scale),and at least a 3.50 in any graduate study. The average cumulative GPA of admitted applicants is 3.60.\nStaff in the Computer Science Graduate Student Affairs Office review and convert, as necessary, the marks or grades of all applicants. The Graduate Division online application asks applicants to submit their grade point average on the scale used by their institutions.\nThe department does not provide “pre-application” reviews. Prospective applicants should review this page, frequently asked questions, and the department’s annual report to determine their admission competitiveness, and academic and research fit with the university.\nDeciding Between the CS PhD and MS Programs\nStudents may apply for either the Ph.D. program or the M.S. program but not both. Admission to the Ph.D. program is more selective than for the M.S. program. In general, the admissions committee does not consider Ph.D. applicants for admission into the M.S. program and vice versa. While a Ph.D. degree prepares students not only for careers in research and academia, those who apply for a Ph.D. degree typically demonstrate significant achievement in and/or potential for advancing knowledge through independent research and teaching.\nWhile a M.S. degree prepares students not only for careers in the industry, those who apply for an M.S degree typically demonstrate interest in developing and applying technical skills and translational knowledge. M.S. applicants should be aware that the selection process is rigorous for M.S. students who later apply for admission into the Ph.D. program.\nApplicants who hold a master’s degree in computer science or a closely related discipline will not be considered for admission to the master’s program. Applicants who hold only a bachelor’s degree may apply to the Ph.D. program. In recent years, the majority of PhD admittees have completed only a bachelor’s degree.\n(1) Letters of Recommendation\nAt least THREE (3) letters of recommendation must be submitted using the graduate application link above. You will be asked to enter the names and emails of your recommenders in the application. They will then receive a link to submit their recommendations.\nFor M.S. applicants: We recommend that you provide letters of reference from professors who have taught you in your junior and senior years.\nIf you are an ESAP applicant to the CS MS program, you will need two letters of rec from CS faculty/instructors or instructors from outside the department that have a joint appointment with the UCLA CS Dept (i.e. Professors Achuta Kadambi and Mani Srivastava are ECE faculty with joint appointments with the CS Dept). If the faculty member does not have a joint appointment with the UCLA CS Dept they cannot serve as one of your two letters of rec for the CS M program as an ESAP applicant.\nFor Ph.D. applicants: We urge that all your letters be from academic or professional references as recent as possible and from people who can comment on your recent professional accomplishments and your qualifications for graduate study in Computer Science. If you have an M.S. degree, letters from professors who have served on your M.S. committee are particularly helpful.\nLetters are due December 15. We will make every effort to review late letters received by December 15, but we cannot guarantee that they will be included in the review.\n(2) Transcripts\nAll applicants are required to upload ONE (1) official transcript from each post-secondary institution attended. Official transcripts should be uploaded to your online application only. Only if you are officially offered admissions into our program will you send us your final official transcript/degree certificate/diplomas.\nApplicants who are attending or have graduated from a U.S. institution that transmits transcripts electronically may request to have official transcripts emailed to: gradadm@cs.ucla.edu but can also upload the official transcript in their online application.\nOfficial transcripts are defined as original documents issued by the institution that bear the actual signature of the Registrar — not a photocopy — and the seal of the issuing institution. Do not, however, send the original of an academic record that cannot be replaced; upload a properly certified copy instead.\nInternational applicants should refer to the “Requirements for International Students” section of the Graduate Division webpage for information about submission of foreign academic records. We do not request or review WES evaluations.\nMost applicants are in the process of completing a degree. If offered admission, the final transcript indicating the date of the degree conferral may be submitted during the summer. Applicants from India and China who have graduated must submit official copies of their degree certificates along with their final official transcripts and diploma: \n\n\n\n\nIf you are receiving your bachelor’s degree from a university in China\n \n\n\nIf your bachelor’s degree has been awarded, please upload your final official transcripts both in English and Chinese (make sure the GPA scale is included when you upload these documents), the official degree certificate both in English and Chinese and the official diploma in both English and Chinese in your online application.\nIf you are still enrolled and have not been awarded your degree from your university in China, please be sure to upload your latest official transcripts both in English and Chinese in your online admissions application (make sure your university’s GPA scale is included when you upload these documents).\n\n\n\n\nIf you are receiving your bachelor’s degree from a university in India\n \n\n\nIf you have received your bachelor’s degree from a university in India, please be sure to upload a copy of your final official transcripts along with a copy of your official diploma that shows when your degree was officially conferred and awarded.\nPlease note the conferral certificate is NOT the same as the official diploma.\nIf you have not been awarded your degree and are still enrolled in a university in India, please be sure to upload a copy of your official transcripts in your online admissions application (make sure your university’s GPA scale is included when you upload these documents).\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIf you are receiving your bachelor’s Degree from a University outside the U.S. (and not from India and China)\n\n\nIf you have been awarded your degree, please be sure to upload your official transcript both in English and the native language from the country the university is located in, and a copy of your official diploma both in English and the native official language from the country the university you attended in your online application.\nIf you are currently enrolled and have not been awarded your degree from your university, please be sure to upload your official transcripts in both English and the native official language from the country the university you are attending in your online application (make sure your university’s GPA scale is included when you upload these documents).\n\n\n\n\nOfficial transcripts are due December 15 along with the application (officially transcripts should be uploaded in your graduate application before you submit the application).

Most questions can be answered by simply reviewing or searching a topic, such as GRE, TOEFL, official transcripts, personal statement, letters of recommendation, and document status on the above webpages.\nBachelor's Degree\nThe general requirement for admission for a U.S. student is a bachelor’s degree from a regionally accredited institution, comparable in standard and content to a bachelor’s degree from the University of California. Applicants should have the necessary academic preparation to complete graduate level courses in Computer Science.\nDegrees which are not considered comparable include those granted on the basis of work completed at institutions which are not fully accredited and those granted on the basis of nonacademic prior learning, test scores, or other than organized supervised coursework in academic subjects.\nAn international student whose post-secondary education is completed outside of the U.S. is expected to hold a degree representing completion of at least four years of study with above average/very good scholarship from a university or university-level institution.\nEnglish Proficiency\nInternational applicants must meet the university’s minimum requirement for the TOEFL or IELTS. Please visit this page for detailed information. Conditional admission is not offered and a transitional or pre-master’s program is not available.\nGrade Point Average (GPA)\nThe university requires a cumulative GPA of at least 3.0 for consideration. The department reviews all applicants who have earned a cumulative GPA of at least 3.0. The most competitive applicants have an undergraduate cumulative GPA of at least 3.5 (on a 4.00 scale),and at least a 3.50 in any graduate study. The average cumulative GPA of admitted applicants is 3.60.\nStaff in the Computer Science Graduate Student Affairs Office review and convert, as necessary, the marks or grades of all applicants. The Graduate Division online application asks applicants to submit their grade point average on the scale used by their institutions.\nThe department does not provide “pre-application” reviews. Prospective applicants should review this page, frequently asked questions, and the department’s annual report to determine their admission competitiveness, and academic and research fit with the university.\nDeciding Between the CS PhD and MS Programs\nStudents may apply for either the Ph.D. program or the M.S. program but not both. Admission to the Ph.D. program is more selective than for the M.S. program. In general, the admissions committee does not consider Ph.D. applicants for admission into the M.S. program and vice versa. While a Ph.D. degree prepares students not only for careers in research and academia, those who apply for a Ph.D. degree typically demonstrate significant achievement in and/or potential for advancing knowledge through independent research and teaching.\nWhile a M.S. degree prepares students not only for careers in the industry, those who apply for an M.S degree typically demonstrate interest in developing and applying technical skills and translational knowledge. M.S. applicants should be aware that the selection process is rigorous for M.S. students who later apply for admission into the Ph.D. program.\nApplicants who hold a master’s degree in computer science or a closely related discipline will not be considered for admission to the master’s program. Applicants who hold only a bachelor’s degree may apply to the Ph.D. program. In recent years, the majority of PhD admittees have completed only a bachelor’s degree.\n(1) Letters of Recommendation\nAt least THREE (3) letters of recommendation must be submitted using the graduate application link above. You will be asked to enter the names and emails of your recommenders in the application. They will then receive a link to submit their recommendations.\nFor M.S. applicants: We recommend that you provide letters of reference from professors who have taught you in your junior and senior years.\nIf you are an ESAP applicant to the CS MS program, you will need two letters of rec from CS faculty/instructors or instructors from outside the department that have a joint appointment with the UCLA CS Dept (i.e. Professors Achuta Kadambi and Mani Srivastava are ECE faculty with joint appointments with the CS Dept). If the faculty member does not have a joint appointment with the UCLA CS Dept they cannot serve as one of your two letters of rec for the CS M program as an ESAP applicant.\nFor Ph.D. applicants: We urge that all your letters be from academic or professional references as recent as possible and from people who can comment on your recent professional accomplishments and your qualifications for graduate study in Computer Science. If you have an M.S. degree, letters from professors who have served on your M.S. committee are particularly helpful.\nLetters are due December 15. We will make every effort to review late letters received by December 15, but we cannot guarantee that they will be included in the review.\n(2) Transcripts\nAll applicants are required to upload ONE (1) official transcript from each post-secondary institution attended. Official transcripts should be uploaded to your online application only. Only if you are officially offered admissions into our program will you send us your final official transcript/degree certificate/diplomas.\nApplicants who are attending or have graduated from a U.S. institution that transmits transcripts electronically may request to have official transcripts emailed to: gradadm@cs.ucla.edu but can also upload the official transcript in their online application.\nOfficial transcripts are defined as original documents issued by the institution that bear the actual signature of the Registrar — not a photocopy — and the seal of the issuing institution. Do not, however, send the original of an academic record that cannot be replaced; upload a properly certified copy instead.\nInternational applicants should refer to the “Requirements for International Students” section of the Graduate Division webpage for information about submission of foreign academic records.

Applicants should have the necessary academic preparation to complete graduate level courses in Computer Science.\nDegrees which are not considered comparable include those granted on the basis of work completed at institutions which are not fully accredited and those granted on the basis of nonacademic prior learning, test scores, or other than organized supervised coursework in academic subjects.\nAn international student whose post-secondary education is completed outside of the U.S. is expected to hold a degree representing completion of at least four years of study with above average/very good scholarship from a university or university-level institution.\nEnglish Proficiency\nInternational applicants must meet the university’s minimum requirement for the TOEFL or IELTS. Please visit this page for detailed information. Conditional admission is not offered and a transitional or pre-master’s program is not available.\nGrade Point Average (GPA)\nThe university requires a cumulative GPA of at least 3.0 for consideration. The department reviews all applicants who have earned a cumulative GPA of at least 3.0. The most competitive applicants have an undergraduate cumulative GPA of at least 3.5 (on a 4.00 scale),and at least a 3.50 in any graduate study. The average cumulative GPA of admitted applicants is 3.60.\nStaff in the Computer Science Graduate Student Affairs Office review and convert, as necessary, the marks or grades of all applicants. The Graduate Division online application asks applicants to submit their grade point average on the scale used by their institutions.\nThe department does not provide “pre-application” reviews. Prospective applicants should review this page, frequently asked questions, and the department’s annual report to determine their admission competitiveness, and academic and research fit with the university.\nDeciding Between the CS PhD and MS Programs\nStudents may apply for either the Ph.D. program or the M.S. program but not both. Admission to the Ph.D. program is more selective than for the M.S. program. In general, the admissions committee does not consider Ph.D. applicants for admission into the M.S. program and vice versa. While a Ph.D. degree prepares students not only for careers in research and academia, those who apply for a Ph.D. degree typically demonstrate significant achievement in and/or potential for advancing knowledge through independent research and teaching.\nWhile a M.S. degree prepares students not only for careers in the industry, those who apply for an M.S degree typically demonstrate interest in developing and applying technical skills and translational knowledge. M.S. applicants should be aware that the selection process is rigorous for M.S. students who later apply for admission into the Ph.D. program.\nApplicants who hold a master’s degree in computer science or a closely related discipline will not be considered for admission to the master’s program. Applicants who hold only a bachelor’s degree may apply to the Ph.D. program. In recent years, the majority of PhD admittees have completed only a bachelor’s degree.\n(1) Letters of Recommendation\nAt least THREE (3) letters of recommendation must be submitted using the graduate application link above. You will be asked to enter the names and emails of your recommenders in the application. They will then receive a link to submit their recommendations.\nFor M.S. applicants: We recommend that you provide letters of reference from professors who have taught you in your junior and senior years.\nIf you are an ESAP applicant to the CS MS program, you will need two letters of rec from CS faculty/instructors or instructors from outside the department that have a joint appointment with the UCLA CS Dept (i.e. Professors Achuta Kadambi and Mani Srivastava are ECE faculty with joint appointments with the CS Dept). If the faculty member does not have a joint appointment with the UCLA CS Dept they cannot serve as one of your two letters of rec for the CS M program as an ESAP applicant.\nFor Ph.D. applicants: We urge that all your letters be from academic or professional references as recent as possible and from people who can comment on your recent professional accomplishments and your qualifications for graduate study in Computer Science. If you have an M.S. degree, letters from professors who have served on your M.S. committee are particularly helpful.\nLetters are due December 15. We will make every effort to review late letters received by December 15, but we cannot guarantee that they will be included in the review.\n(2) Transcripts\nAll applicants are required to upload ONE (1) official transcript from each post-secondary institution attended. Official transcripts should be uploaded to your online application only. Only if you are officially offered admissions into our program will you send us your final official transcript/degree certificate/diplomas.\nApplicants who are attending or have graduated from a U.S. institution that transmits transcripts electronically may request to have official transcripts emailed to: gradadm@cs.ucla.edu but can also upload the official transcript in their online application.\nOfficial transcripts are defined as original documents issued by the institution that bear the actual signature of the Registrar — not a photocopy — and the seal of the issuing institution. Do not, however, send the original of an academic record that cannot be replaced; upload a properly certified copy instead.\nInternational applicants should refer to the “Requirements for International Students” section of the Graduate Division webpage for information about submission of foreign academic records. We do not request or review WES evaluations.\nMost applicants are in the process of completing a degree. If offered admission, the final transcript indicating the date of the degree conferral may be submitted during the summer. Applicants from India and China who have graduated must submit official copies of their degree certificates along with their final official transcripts and diploma: \n\n\n\n\nIf you are receiving your bachelor’s degree from a university in China\n \n\n\nIf your bachelor’s degree has been awarded, please upload your final official transcripts both in English and Chinese (make sure the GPA scale is included when you upload these documents), the official degree certificate both in English and Chinese and the official diploma in both English and Chinese in your online application.\nIf you are still enrolled and have not been awarded your degree from your university in China, please be sure to upload your latest official transcripts both in English and Chinese in your online admissions application (make sure your university’s GPA scale is included when you upload these documents).\n\n\n\n\nIf you are receiving your bachelor’s degree from a university in India\n \n\n\nIf you have received your bachelor’s degree from a university in India, please be sure to upload a copy of your final official transcripts along with a copy of your official diploma that shows when your degree was officially conferred and awarded.\nPlease note the conferral certificate is NOT the same as the official diploma.\nIf you have not been awarded your degree and are still enrolled in a university in India, please be sure to upload a copy of your official transcripts in your online admissions application (make sure your university’s GPA scale is included when you upload these documents).\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIf you are receiving your bachelor’s Degree from a University outside the U.S. (and not from India and China)\n\n\nIf you have been awarded your degree, please be sure to upload your official transcript both in English and the native language from the country the university is located in, and a copy of your official diploma both in English and the native official language from the country the university you attended in your online application.\nIf you are currently enrolled and have not been awarded your degree from your university, please be sure to upload your official transcripts in both English and the native official language from the country the university you are attending in your online application (make sure your university’s GPA scale is included when you upload these documents).\n\n\n\n\nOfficial transcripts are due December 15 along with the application (officially transcripts should be uploaded in your graduate application before you submit the application). We will make every effort to review materials received after December 15, but we cannot guarantee that they will be included in the review (please do not email nor call).\nUCLA students and alumni please note: You do not have to submit an official UCLA transcript. You may upload your MyUCLA record in the online application.\n(3) GRE (optional)\n**GRE Requirement for Fall 2025-2026 Admissions Cycle Only**Students who wish to apply for admission to our graduate program for the 2025-2026 academic year (applications for this cycle are due December 15, 2024) are not required to take the GRE or submit a GRE score report as part of their application package. However, students may voluntarily submit GRE test scores and they will be reviewed as part of the holistic application consideration.

If you leave out your middle name or use a different email address the scores might not synch up to your graduate admissions application, and we cannot guarantee your scores will be received by the deadline. As long as you ordered the scores to be sent to the correct school and department by the deadline you’re fine. You will be contacted if any document or application material is missing or needed. Please do not email or call to inquire about receipt of documents as it will delay our efforts to process application material. Our office is able to match test reports and transcripts for nearly all applicants however it takes time due to the volume of applicants. An applicant is denied admission consideration due to an incomplete file only if they do not respond to our request to submit missing material.\nPhD Funding\nApplicants to the Ph.D. program will automatically be considered for departmental funding, and awards will be given based on the applicant’s academic merit and potential. All Ph.D. applicants who are offered admission are provided financial support from either department resources or the research grants of individual faculty members. Ph.D. admittees are provided a funding offer shortly after being notified of their admission. Domestic Ph.D. applicants are strongly encouraged to explore university-wide fellowships, especially the Eugene V. Cota-Robles Fellowship, detailed in the UCLA Division of Graduate Education financial support webpage.\nMS Funding\nM.S. applicants are not eligible for departmental financial support.\nTAing/GSRs/Reader positions are not part of the Computer Science Masters Program/Curriculum and M.S. student (both incoming and continuing) are not guaranteed TAships/GSRs/Reader positions (i.e. Dept funding) for any year.\nInternational M.S. applicants must demonstrate personal or agency financial support of at least $65,000 for the first year to qualify for a visa to study in the U.S. Prospective international M.S. applicants should apply for admission ONLY if they can provide such documentation, which will be requested if admission is offered, in early March. Information on the cost of attendance is available on the UCLA Division of Graduate Education’s webpage. Specific charges for tuition and fees and non-resident supplemental tuition are listed on the Registrar’s fee page.\nTherefore prospective M.S. students are aware upon applying that if they are admitted they must demonstrate they have the financial support for our program. Proof of this financial support is also requested when an international student is admitted into our M.S program. International students must submit their Confidential Financial Statement (CFS) in order to verify evidence/proof of financial support and issuance of a UCLA I-20.\nDomestic M.S. applicants are strongly encouraged to explore university-wide fellowships and grants and external fellowships, especially the Graduate Opportunity Fellowship Program (GOFP), detailed in the UCLA Division of Graduate Education’s financial support webpage.\nTeaching Assistant (TA) or Graduate Student Researcher (GSR) Positions\nCS PhD students have priority consideration for TA and GSR positions.

Over the last few years, we have found that for 99% of the responses to these inquiries can be found on this FAQ admission webpage. Most questions can be answered by simply reviewing or searching a topic, such as GRE, TOEFL, official transcripts, personal statement and document status.\nIn the rare instance when a question is not answered on one of the above webpages or in the general response below, a personalized email response may be provided. As noted in the above webpages, applicants are asked not to make email or phone inquiries about the receipt of documents. Doing so will delay our efforts to process application material.\nTo apply for the Computer Science PhD or MS program, submit the UCLA application for graduate admission and select “Computer Science MS” or “Computer Science PhD” as your intended program of study. Applications are due by December 15 at 23:59 pm (Pacific Time).\nIt is the prospective applicant’s responsibility to do their research and review this page, frequently asked questions, to determine their admission competitiveness, and academic and research fit with the university/program they are applying to. Due to the volume of applications and in fairness to all our applicants, we do not provide application feedback or “pre-application” reviews.\nAn applicant for admission must hold a bachelor’s degree from an accredited college or university, must have the necessary academic preparation to complete graduate level courses in computer science, and must be able to score competitively on the GRE test. The university requires at least a scholastic average of B (3.0 on a 4.0 scale) or its equivalent if the letter grade system is not used. We expect at least a 3.50 GPA (on a 4.00 scale) in the junior and senior years, and at least 3.50 in any graduate study.\nThe GRE will not be required for the 2025-2026 Admissions cycle. Previously there are no minimums required for GRE.\nInternational students must submit a TOEFL with a score of at least 87 (computer-based) or 560 (paper-based), or an IELTS with a score of at least 7.0.\nConditional admission is not offered. A transitional or pre-master’s program is not available.\nNo. The Computer Science Department accepts applications for Fall quarter only. Applications should be submitted only between mid-September and the deadline of December 15.\nFollowing are data for applicants admitted for study beginning Fall 2022.\nAverage GPA of all applicants/admittees: 3.75 (A=4.0)\nThe vast majority of applicants have a background in computer science. Other majors represented include electrical engineering, math, statistics, and physics. For undergraduate work, we recommend 2 years of calculus (through differential equations and introduction to discreet structures), 1 year of physics (mechanics; Oscillations, Waves, Electric and Magnetic Fields); and a statistics course. Additional recommended coursework in Computer Science include: Operating Systems Principles, Computer Network Fundamentals, Computer Systems Architecture, Software Engineering, Programming Languages, Compiler Construction, Data Management Systems, Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence, Intro to Computer Graphics, Intro to Algorithms and Complexity.\nMany CS graduate courses have prerequisites which consist of CS upper division undergrad classes (which are only offered at 4 year institutions and not at community colleges). Therefore we recommend students review the Computer Science course catalog, look at the CS grad classes offered and look at the prerequisites for those classes. If you have not taken the class then the instructor may not allow you to take that course. While you may take CS upper division undergrad classes, note it may delay/impact you being able to finish within the 2 years.\nAn applicant without a strong computer science background may be a very competitive applicant. Having professional experience as well as having taken courses that are equivalent to prerequisites for upper division undergraduate coursework, and the upper division courses themselves, would be most helpful. Applicants best illustrate their professional experience by succinctly describing their skills and projects in the statement of purpose, and submitting letters of recommendation that relate their achievements and skills to their potential for success in their degree and career objectives.\nUnfortunately, it is difficult to take CS courses at U.S. 4-year state universities due to the priority rules favoring admitted, full-time degree seeking students, community colleges typically offer only the prerequisites of the prerequisites, and extension programs offer mainly application courses and not courses equivalent to upper-division courses. However, every course taken and/or work skill achieved leads to a more competitive application. UCLA does not offer a transitional or pre-admission program, and  does not consider applications for a second bachelor’s degree. Courses offered by UCLA Extension that have the exact same course number as the courses offered in UCLA undergraduate and graduate degree programs provide good preparation.\nMSCS Program\nThe Computer Science Department has a regular Master of Science Program, which is designed to nurture the next generation of computing professionals with the required depth and breadth of computer science knowledge. The MSCS program is a part of the Computer Science department. To apply for the MSCS program, please click HERE.\nMEng Program\nSamueli School of Engineering has a one-year Master of Engineering (MEng) self-supporting, professional degree designed to develop future engineering leaders. The MENG degree addresses the needs of both students and industry, tailored to those who wish to pursue technical management positions, with both high-tech skill set and management savvy. The MEng program is not part of the Computer Science department.  To apply for the MEng, go to https://www.meng.ucla.edu/admissions/\nMSCS vs. MENG\nThe Computer Science Department offers Master’s of Computer Science (MSCS) Program, which is a 2-year program and has existed over 50 years. MEngr program is a new, one-year program. The MENG degree addresses the needs of both students and industry, tailored to those who wish to pursue technical management positions. Both MSCS and MENG programs include a capstone project with technological concentration.\nCan I apply to both programs since they are housed in different departments?\nNo, you may only apply to one program.\nWhat are the differences between the MEng program and the MSCS program?\nThe Department of Computer Science Master Program (MCSC) is a 2-year program that has existed for over 50 years.  The Master of Engineering Program (MENG) is a 1-year program that is starting its 2nd year\nNumber of Applications for 2022 Admissions Cycle\nMENG Capstone topic is selected by the course instructor.\nMSCS Capstone topic is student-driven in which the students decide the topic and find their capstone advisor (must be CS faculty). The MSCS Capstone project is advised by faculty in the Department of Computer Science.\nStudents in the MSCS program (Master’s in Computer Science) could choose a thesis option, instead of Capstone. The MS thesis option is designed to provide in-depth research opportunities with CS faculty. MENG does not provide a thesis option.\nIn fairness to applicants and to assure the efficacy of the selection process, we cannot guarantee that your file will be reviewed if application materials such as test scores and transcripts are submitted after the December 15 deadline.

Degree requirements are listed at the Computer Science Department website.\nThe computer science M.S. and Ph.D. degree programs do not incorporate distance learning courses. However, the UCLA Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science does offer an online Master of Engineering degree.\nNo. Students must be registered and enrolled each quarter for a minimum of 12 units. Unless granted a formal leave of absence, students are expected to register every term, including the term in which their degree or certificate is to be awarded. The filing fee may be used in lieu of registration if all formal requirements for the degree, except for filing the thesis or taking the comprehensive examination, are met prior to the first day of instruction of the term.\nThe number of terms to complete a degree program varies from student to student. On average, the M.S. degree is earned in 5 quarters (F, W, Sp, F, W, S), but some may need 6 quarters (2 full years) to finish. The MS program is an in-person 2 year full-time program.\nThe normative length of time for Ph.D. students to complete their degree is 6 years.\nThere is no specialization for the MS program. On the application we do ask applicants to select the field they are interested so that if they are offered admissions we can do our best (but do not guarantee) to pair them with an initial faculty advisor in the field they are interested.\nFor Fall 2025-2026 admissions application cycle only:Students who wish to apply for admission to our graduate program for the 2025-2026  academic year (applications are due December 15, 2024) are not required to take the GRE or submit a GRE score report as part of their application package.

Over the last few years, we have found that for 99% of the responses to these inquiries can be found on this FAQ admission webpage. Most questions can be answered by simply reviewing or searching a topic, such as GRE, TOEFL, official transcripts, personal statement and document status.\nIn the rare instance when a question is not answered on one of the above webpages or in the general response below, a personalized email response may be provided. As noted in the above webpages, applicants are asked not to make email or phone inquiries about the receipt of documents. Doing so will delay our efforts to process application material.\nApplication/Admission Requirements and Data\n\nHow do I apply?\nTo apply for the Computer Science PhD or MS program, submit the UCLA application for graduate admission and select “Computer Science MS” or “Computer Science PhD” as your intended program of study. Applications are due by December 15 at 23:59 pm (Pacific Time).\n\nDoes the department provide “pre-application” reviews?\nIt is the prospective applicant’s responsibility to do their research and review this page, frequently asked questions, to determine their admission competitiveness, and academic and research fit with the university/program they are applying to. Due to the volume of applications and in fairness to all our applicants, we do not provide application feedback or “pre-application” reviews.\n\nWhat are the application requirements?\nAn applicant for admission must hold a bachelor’s degree from an accredited college or university, must have the necessary academic preparation to complete graduate level courses in computer science, and must be able to score competitively on the GRE test. The university requires at least a scholastic average of B (3.0 on a 4.0 scale) or its equivalent if the letter grade system is not used. We expect at least a 3.50 GPA (on a 4.00 scale) in the junior and senior years, and at least 3.50 in any graduate study.\nThe GRE will not be required for the 2025-2026 Admissions cycle. Previously there are no minimums required for GRE.\nInternational students must submit a TOEFL with a score of at least 87 (computer-based) or 560 (paper-based), or an IELTS with a score of at least 7.0.\nConditional admission is not offered. A transitional or pre-master’s program is not available.\n\nDo you accept applications for admission for study beginning winter or spring quarter?\nNo. The Computer Science Department accepts applications for Fall quarter only. Applications should be submitted only between mid-September and the deadline of December 15.\n\nHow many applications do you receive, and how many students were admitted?\nFollowing are data for applicants admitted for study beginning Fall 2022.\n\n\n\n \nM.S.\nPh.D.\n\n\nApplicants\n3,200\n  906\n\n\nAdmittees\n  140\n    47\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\nAverage GPA of all applicants/admittees: 3.75 (A=4.0)\n\nMy academic background is not in Computer Science. Am I eligible to apply to your graduate program? What are the prerequisites?\nThe vast majority of applicants have a background in computer science. Other majors represented include electrical engineering, math, statistics, and physics. For undergraduate work, we recommend 2 years of calculus (through differential equations and introduction to discreet structures), 1 year of physics (mechanics; Oscillations, Waves, Electric and Magnetic Fields); and a statistics course. Additional recommended coursework in Computer Science include: Operating Systems Principles, Computer Network Fundamentals, Computer Systems Architecture, Software Engineering, Programming Languages, Compiler Construction, Data Management Systems, Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence, Intro to Computer Graphics, Intro to Algorithms and Complexity. \nMany CS graduate courses have prerequisites which consist of CS upper division undergrad classes (which are only offered at 4 year institutions and not at community colleges). Therefore we recommend students review the Computer Science course catalog, look at the CS grad classes offered and look at the prerequisites for those classes. If you have not taken the class then the instructor may not allow you to take that course. While you may take CS upper division undergrad classes, note it may delay/impact you being able to finish within the 2 years.\nAn applicant without a strong computer science background may be a very competitive applicant. Having professional experience as well as having taken courses that are equivalent to prerequisites for upper division undergraduate coursework, and the upper division courses themselves, would be most helpful. Applicants best illustrate their professional experience by succinctly describing their skills and projects in the statement of purpose, and submitting letters of recommendation that relate their achievements and skills to their potential for success in their degree and career objectives.\nUnfortunately, it is difficult to take CS courses at U.S. 4-year state universities due to the priority rules favoring admitted, full-time degree seeking students, community colleges typically offer only the prerequisites of the prerequisites, and extension programs offer mainly application courses and not courses equivalent to upper-division courses. However, every course taken and/or work skill achieved leads to a more competitive application. UCLA does not offer a transitional or pre-admission program, and  does not consider applications for a second bachelor’s degree. Courses offered by UCLA Extension that have the exact same course number as the courses offered in UCLA undergraduate and graduate degree programs provide good preparation.\nMSCS Program \nThe Computer Science Department has a regular Master of Science Program, which is designed to nurture the next generation of computing professionals with the required depth and breadth of computer science knowledge. The MSCS program is a part of the Computer Science department.

Both MSCS and MENG programs include a capstone project with technological concentration. \nCan I apply to both programs since they are housed in different departments?\nNo, you may only apply to one program. \nWhat are the differences between the MEng program and the MSCS program?\nThe Department of Computer Science Master Program (MCSC) is a 2-year program that has existed for over 50 years.  The Master of Engineering Program (MENG) is a 1-year program that is starting its 2nd year\nNumber of Applications for 2022 Admissions Cycle\n\nMCSC (MS program in the Computer Science Department) had over 4000 applications and 150 offers were made.\nMENG (MEng program in School of Engineering) had 573 applications and 220 offers were made.\n\nCapstone \nMENG Capstone topic is selected by the course instructor.\nMSCS Capstone topic is student-driven in which the students decide the topic and find their capstone advisor (must be CS faculty). The MSCS Capstone project is advised by faculty in the Department of Computer Science.  \nThesis\nStudents in the MSCS program (Master’s in Computer Science) could choose a thesis option, instead of Capstone. The MS thesis option is designed to provide in-depth research opportunities with CS faculty. MENG does not provide a thesis option. \n\n Will my application be reviewed if any application material is submitted after December 15?\nIn fairness to applicants and to assure the efficacy of the selection process, we cannot guarantee that your file will be reviewed if application materials such as test scores and transcripts are submitted after the December 15 deadline. As long as you ordered the scores by the test maker (i.e. ETS, IELTS) to be sent to the correct school and program (it is the student’s responsibility to make sure they did) by the deadline it’s fine. Modifications/edits to the admissions application or materials (i.e. statement of purpose, personal history, etc) are not allowed. The number of qualified applicants far exceeds the number of available seats.\n\nHow can I apply for a Fee Waiver?\nFee Waiver criteria may be found here: https://grad.ucla.edu/admissions/faqs/\n \nIt is the applicant’s responsibility to upload all the required documents (i.e. letter from Program Director confirming program participation for eligible programs, letter from financial aid officer from university/college you are currently enrolled in, statement from the registrar’s office confirming certain information, etc) as stated on the Fee Waiver Criteria webpage , in your online application before submitting your admissions application (the deadline to submit your admission application is December 15).\n \n \nIt is the applicant’s responsibility to redact or block out all U.S. Social Security numbers before submitting the document that have social security numbers on it.  If a U.S. Social Security number is visible on the document, the UCLA Graduate Division cannot accept it and the CS department cannot redact or block out this information for an applicant.\n \n \nDue to the heavy volume of applicants, If you submit your fee waiver materials to the CS dept after the deadline we cannot guarantee it will be reviewed.

If you leave out your middle name or use a different email address the scores might not synch up to your graduate admissions application and we cannot guarantee your scores will be received by the deadline. The number of qualified applicants far exceeds the number of available seats.\nWhen will my application be reviewed?\nThe faculty begin reviewing Ph.D. applications in December and M.S. applications in January.\nWhen will I be informed of my admission status?\nIf you are a Ph.D. or M.S. applicant you will be notified by late April.\nWhen is the university closed for the holidays?\nPlease visit the university’s academic and administrative calendar.\nDegree Objective and Requirements\n\nMay I apply to both M.S. and Ph.D. degree programs?\nYou may apply to either the Ph.D. program or the M.S. program but not both. Admission to the Ph.D. program is more selective than for the M.S. program. In general, the admissions committee does not consider Ph.D. applicants for admission into the M.S. program and vice versa. While a Ph.D. degree prepares students not only for careers in research and academia, those who apply for a Ph.D. degree typically demonstrate significant achievement in and/or potential for advancing knowledge through independent research and teaching.While a M.S. degree prepares students not only for careers in the industry, those who apply for an M.S. degree typically demonstrate interest in developing and applying technical skills and translational knowledge. M.S. applicants should be aware that the selection process is rigorous for M.S. students who later apply for admission into the Ph.D. program.\n\nMay I apply to the M.S. program if I already have earned or will soon earn a master’s degree?\nYou will not be considered for admission into the M.S. program if you already have a master’s degree in computer science or similar discipline such as information sciences or data systems or currently enrolled in an MS degree in a related field. As with many computer science departments, the number of qualified applicants far exceeds the number of available seats.\nFriendly reminder we do not accept transfers.\n\nAm I required to have a master’s degree to apply to the Ph.D. program?\nNo. In the Ph.D. classes beginning study Fall Quarter 2013 and Fall Quarter 2014, 48% and 32%, respectively, had earned only a bachelor’s degree.\n\nIf I am a Ph.D. applicant, may I earn an M.S. degree while completing my Ph.D. at UCLA?\nYes, but only if you have not previously earned an M.S. degree in computer science or a related field. You may petition for an M.S. degree as you fulfill the M.S. degree requirements. The Ph.D. Written Qualifying Exam (WQE) may be substituted for the M.S. comprehensive exam or thesis. Degree requirements are listed at the Computer Science Department website.\n\nDoes Computer Science offer a distance learning program?\nThe computer science M.S. and Ph.D. degree programs do not incorporate distance learning courses. However, the UCLA Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science does offer an online Master of Engineering degree.\n\nDoes Computer Science offer a part-time program?\nNo. Students must be registered and enrolled each quarter for a minimum of 12 units. Unless granted a formal leave of absence, students are expected to register every term, including the term in which their degree or certificate is to be awarded. The filing fee may be used in lieu of registration if all formal requirements for the degree, except for filing the thesis or taking the comprehensive examination, are met prior to the first day of instruction of the term.\n\nHow long does it take to earn an M.S. or Ph.D. degree?\nThe number of terms to complete a degree program varies from student to student. On average, the M.S. degree is earned in 5 quarters (F, W, Sp, F, W, S), but some may need 6 quarters (2 full years) to finish. The MS program is an in-person 2 year full-time program.\nThe normative length of time for Ph.D. students to complete their degree is 6 years.\n\nIs there a specialization for the MS program?\nThere is no specialization for the MS program. On the application we do ask applicants to select the field they are interested so that if they are offered admissions we can do our best (but do not guarantee) to pair them with an initial faculty advisor in the field they are interested.\nMay I apply to both M.S. and Ph.D. degree programs?\nYou may apply to either the Ph.D. program or the M.S. program but not both.

Information is available at the university housing website.\nAre there any special housing arrangements for computer science students? \nThe Computer Science Department has been allocated a limited number of spaces to hold for funded, incoming Ph.D. students in Weyburn Terrace/Hilgard Apartments.\nHow do students locate housing around UCLA and Los Angeles?\nA good place to start is the UCLA Community Housing Office (CHO) which provides an online rental database and maintains additional resources to assist those searching for housing in the Los Angeles area. Please visit the community housing website.\n[GRID_TABLE]\nApplication/Admission Requirements and Data\n\nHow do I apply?\nTo apply for the Computer Science PhD or MS program, submit the UCLA application for graduate admission and select “Computer Science MS” or “Computer Science PhD” as your intended program of study. Applications are due by December 15 at 23:59 pm (Pacific Time).\n\nDoes the department provide “pre-application” reviews?\nIt is the prospective applicant’s responsibility to do their research and review this page, frequently asked questions, to determine their admission competitiveness, and academic and research fit with the university/program they are applying to. Due to the volume of applications and in fairness to all our applicants, we do not provide application feedback or “pre-application” reviews.\n\nWhat are the application requirements?\nAn applicant for admission must hold a bachelor’s degree from an accredited college or university, must have the necessary academic preparation to complete graduate level courses in computer science, and must be able to score competitively on the GRE test. The university requires at least a scholastic average of B (3.0 on a 4.0 scale) or its equivalent if the letter grade system is not used. We expect at least a 3.50 GPA (on a 4.00 scale) in the junior and senior years, and at least 3.50 in any graduate study.\nThe GRE will not be required for the 2025-2026 Admissions cycle. Previously there are no minimums required for GRE.\nInternational students must submit a TOEFL with a score of at least 87 (computer-based) or 560 (paper-based), or an IELTS with a score of at least 7.0.\nConditional admission is not offered. A transitional or pre-master’s program is not available.\n\nDo you accept applications for admission for study beginning winter or spring quarter?\nNo. The Computer Science Department accepts applications for Fall quarter only. Applications should be submitted only between mid-September and the deadline of December 15.\n\nHow many applications do you receive, and how many students were admitted?\nFollowing are data for applicants admitted for study beginning Fall 2022.\n\n\n\n \nM.S.\nPh.D.\n\n\nApplicants\n3,200\n  906\n\n\nAdmittees\n  140\n    47\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\nAverage GPA of all applicants/admittees: 3.75 (A=4.0)\n\nMy academic background is not in Computer Science. Am I eligible to apply to your graduate program? What are the prerequisites?\nThe vast majority of applicants have a background in computer science. Other majors represented include electrical engineering, math, statistics, and physics. For undergraduate work, we recommend 2 years of calculus (through differential equations and introduction to discreet structures), 1 year of physics (mechanics; Oscillations, Waves, Electric and Magnetic Fields); and a statistics course. Additional recommended coursework in Computer Science include: Operating Systems Principles, Computer Network Fundamentals, Computer Systems Architecture, Software Engineering, Programming Languages, Compiler Construction, Data Management Systems, Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence, Intro to Computer Graphics, Intro to Algorithms and Complexity. \nMany CS graduate courses have prerequisites which consist of CS upper division undergrad classes (which are only offered at 4 year institutions and not at community colleges). Therefore we recommend students review the Computer Science course catalog, look at the CS grad classes offered and look at the prerequisites for those classes. If you have not taken the class then the instructor may not allow you to take that course. While you may take CS upper division undergrad classes, note it may delay/impact you being able to finish within the 2 years.\nAn applicant without a strong computer science background may be a very competitive applicant. Having professional experience as well as having taken courses that are equivalent to prerequisites for upper division undergraduate coursework, and the upper division courses themselves, would be most helpful. Applicants best illustrate their professional experience by succinctly describing their skills and projects in the statement of purpose, and submitting letters of recommendation that relate their achievements and skills to their potential for success in their degree and career objectives.\nUnfortunately, it is difficult to take CS courses at U.S. 4-year state universities due to the priority rules favoring admitted, full-time degree seeking students, community colleges typically offer only the prerequisites of the prerequisites, and extension programs offer mainly application courses and not courses equivalent to upper-division courses. However, every course taken and/or work skill achieved leads to a more competitive application. UCLA does not offer a transitional or pre-admission program, and  does not consider applications for a second bachelor’s degree. Courses offered by UCLA Extension that have the exact same course number as the courses offered in UCLA undergraduate and graduate degree programs provide good preparation.\nMSCS Program \nThe Computer Science Department has a regular Master of Science Program, which is designed to nurture the next generation of computing professionals with the required depth and breadth of computer science knowledge. The MSCS program is a part of the Computer Science department.

Admission to the Ph.D. program is more selective than for the M.S. program. In general, the admissions committee does not consider Ph.D. applicants for admission into the M.S. program and vice versa. While a Ph.D. degree prepares students not only for careers in research and academia, those who apply for a Ph.D. degree typically demonstrate significant achievement in and/or potential for advancing knowledge through independent research and teaching.While a M.S. degree prepares students not only for careers in the industry, those who apply for an M.S. degree typically demonstrate interest in developing and applying technical skills and translational knowledge. M.S. applicants should be aware that the selection process is rigorous for M.S. students who later apply for admission into the Ph.D. program.\n\nMay I apply to the M.S. program if I already have earned or will soon earn a master’s degree?\nYou will not be considered for admission into the M.S. program if you already have a master’s degree in computer science or similar discipline such as information sciences or data systems or currently enrolled in an MS degree in a related field. As with many computer science departments, the number of qualified applicants far exceeds the number of available seats.\nFriendly reminder we do not accept transfers.\n\nAm I required to have a master’s degree to apply to the Ph.D. program?\nNo. In the Ph.D. classes beginning study Fall Quarter 2013 and Fall Quarter 2014, 48% and 32%, respectively, had earned only a bachelor’s degree.\n\nIf I am a Ph.D. applicant, may I earn an M.S. degree while completing my Ph.D. at UCLA?\nYes, but only if you have not previously earned an M.S. degree in computer science or a related field. You may petition for an M.S. degree as you fulfill the M.S. degree requirements. The Ph.D. Written Qualifying Exam (WQE) may be substituted for the M.S. comprehensive exam or thesis. Degree requirements are listed at the Computer Science Department website.\n\nDoes Computer Science offer a distance learning program?\nThe computer science M.S. and Ph.D. degree programs do not incorporate distance learning courses. However, the UCLA Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science does offer an online Master of Engineering degree.\n\nDoes Computer Science offer a part-time program?\nNo. Students must be registered and enrolled each quarter for a minimum of 12 units. Unless granted a formal leave of absence, students are expected to register every term, including the term in which their degree or certificate is to be awarded. The filing fee may be used in lieu of registration if all formal requirements for the degree, except for filing the thesis or taking the comprehensive examination, are met prior to the first day of instruction of the term.\n\nHow long does it take to earn an M.S. or Ph.D. degree?\nThe number of terms to complete a degree program varies from student to student. On average, the M.S. degree is earned in 5 quarters (F, W, Sp, F, W, S), but some may need 6 quarters (2 full years) to finish. The MS program is an in-person 2 year full-time program.\nThe normative length of time for Ph.D. students to complete their degree is 6 years.\n\nIs there a specialization for the MS program?\nThere is no specialization for the MS program. On the application we do ask applicants to select the field they are interested so that if they are offered admissions we can do our best (but do not guarantee) to pair them with an initial faculty advisor in the field they are interested.\nMay I apply to both M.S. and Ph.D. degree programs?\nYou may apply to either the Ph.D. program or the M.S. program but not both.

Consider whether submitting a test score will strengthen your application, especially if you do not have a quantitative background -- a strong score can enhance your candidacy. For typical test score ranges of admitted students, see our latest class profile.\nCurrent UCLA JD and MD students may submit their LSAT or MCAT score with their MBA application.\nFor more details, see our application requirements.\nIf your education was conducted in a language other than English or in a country where English is not the official language, you must demonstrate English proficiency by submitting either TOEFL or IELTS scores (no preference).

single application for concurrent degree programs?\n\n\n\n\n                                More\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\nNo, there is not a single, shared application. Each program has its own application process and requirements, so you will need to submit separate applications to each program you are interested in, following the instructions provided on each program’s website. You can access the MBA application on our website.\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow are applications evaluated?\n\n\n\n\n                                More\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\nEach program reviews applications and makes admissions decisions independently. The MBA admissions process remains the same whether you are applying solely to the MBA or as part of a concurrent degree.\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen should I apply?\n\n\n\n\n                                More\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\nThe timing of your applications is flexible. Some applicants choose to apply to both programs in the same admissions cycle, while others apply to one program first and, if admitted, apply to the second program the following year. Note: If you are interested in the JD/MBA or MD/MBA, you should submit your MBA application in the admissions cycle that aligns with your intended start (for example, apply in 2025-26 to begin in Summer 2026).\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the MBA application deadlines?\n\n\n\n\n                                More\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\nThe MBA program offers three application deadlines each year: October, January, and April. For the most up-to-date and detailed MBA application deadlines, please visit our website. For the deadlines of our concurrent degree partners, please refer to the respective program’s website.\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf I am admitted to one program, or am currently a UCLA graduate student enrolled in one of the programs, am I guaranteed admission to the MBA program?\n\n\n\n\n                                More\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\nNo, admission to or enrollment in one program does not guarantee admission to the MBA program. Each program has a distinct application process and is reviewed independently.\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs a EA/GRE/GMAT score required for admission to the MBA program?\n\n\n\n\n                                More\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\nOur Full-Time MBA program is currently test-optional. You may choose to submit an EA, GRE, or GMAT score, or instead respond to a prompt about your quantitative and analytical skills. Consider whether submitting a test score will strengthen your application, especially if you do not have a quantitative background -- a strong score can enhance your candidacy. For typical test score ranges of admitted students, see our latest class profile.\nCurrent UCLA JD and MD students may submit their LSAT or MCAT score with their MBA application.\nFor more details, see our application requirements.\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo I need to submit a TOEFL or IELTS score?\n\n\n\n\n                                More\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\nIf your education was conducted in a language other than English or in a country where English is not the official language, you must demonstrate English proficiency by submitting either TOEFL or IELTS scores (no preference). This requirement applies to all UCLA graduate programs. Please note that immigration status or professional experience in English-speaking countries does not exempt you from this requirement. For more information, refer to the UCLA Division of Graduate Education English Requirements.\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich program should I plan to start first?\n\n\n\n\n                                More\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\nIn most cases, we recommend that students begin with their other concurrent degree program and complete one year before starting the MBA. However, JD/MBA students are advised to start the MBA after completing two years of the JD program, while MD/MBA students are required to begin the MBA after completing three years of the MD program. Please plan ahead to ensure you apply during the appropriate MBA admissions cycle.\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo concurrent degree programs have their own cohort?\n\n\n\n\n                                More\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\nNo, they do not. When you are enrolled in MBA courses, you will take classes alongside MBA students. When you are enrolled in courses for your other concurrent degree, you will join students from that program.\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan EMBA or FEMBA students pursue a concurrent degree program?\n\n\n\n\n                                More\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\nNo, EMBA and FEMBA students are not eligible to pursue a concurrent degree program. Only full-time MBA students may participate in a concurrent degree program.\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf I am interested in a concurrent degree program that is not listed above, can I create it?\n\n\n\n\n                                More\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\nNo, you cannot create a customized concurrent degree program. However, if you enroll in the MBA program alone, you may take graduate-level electives in other UCLA departments. Up to three of these electives can be counted toward your MBA degree, allowing you to broaden your expertise in other disciplines while completing your MBA.\nClose\nIs there a single application for concurrent degree programs?\n\n\n\n\n                                More\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\nNo, there is not a single, shared application.

Also included are general regulations concerning graduate courses, standards of scholarship, leaves of absence, normal progress toward degree, and a number of other matters.\nThe content of this handbook is subject to revision. Students should regularly check their CS email account, as most changes in regulations will be sent via email. However, courses, course descriptions, instructor designations, curricular degree requirements, and fees described herein are subject to change or deletion without notice. In all matters, the rules and regulations of the UCLA General Catalog and the Standards and Procedures for Graduate Study at UCLA shall supersede this handbook.\nWe invite you to read and familiarize yourself with the contents of this handbook, and hope it allows you to make your journey at UCLA both smooth and successful.\nIf you are a CS PhD student (both new and continuing PhD students) and have any questions or concerns throughout your tenure in the PhD program at UCLA, please contact Helen Tran at helen@cs.ucla.edu\nIf you are a CS MS student (both new and continuing MS students) and have any questions or concerns throughout your tenure in the MS program at UCLA, please contact Juliana Alvarez at jalvarez@cs.ucla.edu\nMS students are not required to select a major field. They may choose a broad selection of courses or any combination of courses from the following fields:\nM.S. students are encouraged to take CS grad classes in different fields.\nGraduate Advisor: For questions on the CS MS program, which courses to to take, questions on enrollment, signing off on the Advancement to Candidacy form, signing off on the verification of degree completion form, leave of absence, commencement, etc please contact Juliana Alvarez at jalvarez@cs.ucla.edu\nInitial faculty advisor: Each admitted MS student who SIR’s and starts the CS MS program is assigned an initial faculty advisor which is sent to them a few days after Orientation. The initial faculty advisor is not your official capstone/thesis advisor. They are there to answer general questions on the capstone or thesis in general.\nCapstone/Thesis Advisor: It is the MS students responsibility to find an official capstone/thesis advisor. Most students start to find their capstone/thesis advisor once they know the research area/topic they wish to work on (on average towards the end of the second quarter /beginning of the 3rd quarter in the MS program – the MS program is a 2 year program) The capstone/thesis advisor must be CS faculty. Once you find a CS faculty member who is willing to serve as your capstone/thesis advisor, the student must fill out the advisor consent form and have their capstone/thesis advisor sign off on the form and then it is emailed to Juliana Alvarez at jalvarez@cs.ucla.edu. Friendly reminder it is the student’s responsibility to also find their two other committee members as well as their advisor.\nFor a list of CS faculty associated with research areas please click HERE.\nMS students must complete at least three quarters of Computer Science 201 with grades of Satisfactory (in addition to the three quarters of CS 201 that may have been completed for the M.S. degree). CS 201 can only be taken while registered and enrolled in the MS program (you cannot take this class while registered and enrolled as an undergrad student).\nCompletion of the seminars will be reviewed when students submit the Program of Study Form.\nCS PhD students who plan to add the CS MS degree along the way must complete six quarters of COM SCI 201 with an ‘S’ grade.\nReminder: Only formally admitted M.S. students who applied for the M.S. program during admissions are allowed to obtain a degree in the CS M.S. program.\nMS students must be enrolled in a minimum of 12 units. If you have further questions regarding this, please contact Juliana Alvarez at jalvarez@cs.ucla.edu\nFor both plans (all courses used must have been registered, enrolled and received a final grade of B-minus or higher (S/U will not count).  Please be sure to fulfill the three CS 201s and the 9  Program of Study classes.\nFriendly reminder, for CS 298, 596, CS 597, CS 598, you may only enroll under one CS faculty member. You must obtain the CS faculty member’s consent via email first before enrolling under them. It is the student’s responsibility to discuss with the instructor at the start of the quarter how they will be graded for this course.\nMS Program of Study (MS students should focus on completing first)–> Advancement to Candidacy (the paperwork submitted the quarter you are completing your MS program of study class requirements)–>Thesis\nThere are 3 parts the MS program = MS Program of Study + Advancement to Candidacy + Thesis\nM.S. students should submit the M.S. Proposed Program of Study by the end of their 1st term in enrollment at UCLA. Students may submit the form to the CS Graduate Student Affairs Office with coursework in progress or planned for a future quarter. A total of nine courses (each course must be taken for 4 units max and a receive a final passing letter grade of B- or higher) are required for the M.S. degree, including a minimum of five graduate courses. No specific courses are required, but a majority of both the total number of regular graded courses and the total number of graduate courses must consist of courses offered by the Computer Science Department. No lower-division courses may be applied toward the M.S. degree. M.S. students should confer with their faculty advisor to select which academic plan best fits their academic, research, and career goals. For both plans, all courses used must have been registered, enrolled and received a final grade of B-minus or higher (S/U will not count).  Please be sure to fulfill the three CS 201s before finishing the Program of Study. On average, MS students complete the coursework in 5-6 quarters.\nIn order to submit your official MS thesis electronically via DG ETD system,  you must have advanced to candidacy (this includes having submitted your ATC packet which should include the MS Nomination of Thesis Committee Form), attended an ETD workshop and either  be registered and enrolled full-time (for summer you must be registered and enrolled for a minimum of 4 units) or have submitted a filing fee application by the deadline for the quarter you wish to be on filing fee. You cannot Advance to Candidacy and be on Filing Fee at the same time. If you are planning to do filing fee you must submit your Advancement to Candidacy packet one quarter prior to the quarter you plan to be on filing fee (no exceptions). Information on the ATC packet can be found HERE.\nPLAN I – THESIS: In the thesis plan, seven (7) 4-unit courses must be formal courses (taken for letter grades), and at least 4 of the 7 must be 200-level courses in Computer Science. 2 courses (or 8 units) must be CS 598, which involves work on the thesis. The remaining three (3) 4-unit courses are elective courses, which may be 100- or 200-level courses in Computer Science or 200-level courses in a related discipline, i.e. Electrical Engineering, Statistics, Bioinformatics, etc.  You must also take CS 598 for 4 units twice or sign up for CS 598 for 8 units total. Prior to signing up for CS 598 please obtain the consent of your faculty advisor that you are signing up under them for this course. Please note you still need to fulfill the three CS 201 seminars in addition to the 9 classes.\nMASTER’S THESIS COMMITTEE: A Master’s Thesis Committee must be approved by the Graduate Division before the submission of the Petition for Advancement to Candidacy. It is the student’s responsibility to find their thesis advisor/chair plus the two other committee members.  The advisor/chair plus committee members listed on the Nomination of Master’s Committee form (which is submitted with the ATC packet the quarter students are finishing their coursework) must have given their consent prior to the student listing them on the Nomination of Master’s Committee form. The committee consists of a minimum of three members. Two members, including the chair, must hold appointments in the UCLA Computer Science Department (your Chair or Advisor for your thesis must be CS faculty). The remaining member may be a faculty member from either Computer Science, another UCLA department, or another UC campus department. The Master’s Thesis committee regulations and the nomination form are available at: www.gdnet.ucla.edu/gasaa/library/masnomin.pdf\nMASTER’S THESIS: The thesis is a report on the results of student investigation of a problem in the major field of study under the supervision of the thesis committee, which approves the subject and plan of the thesis and reads and approves the complete manuscript. While the problem may be one of only limited scope, the thesis must exhibit a satisfactory style, organization, and depth of understanding of the subject. Students should normally start to plan the thesis at least one year before the award of the M.S. degree. There is no examination under the thesis plan. It is the student’s responsibility to attend an ETD workshop and review the information o the ETD webpage at least one quarter prior (if not earlier) to the one they plan to submit their thesis. On average, students begin thinking about their research area/topic for their Thesis  in 2-3 quarter in the program and begin working on their Thesis in their 4th to 5th  quarter in the program.\nMS Program of Study (MS students should focus on completing this first)–> Advancement to Candidacy (the paperwork submitted the quarter you are completing your MS program of study class requirements)–> Capstone Project\nM.S. students should submit the M.S. Proposed Program of Study by the end of their 1st term in enrollment at UCLA.

No specific courses are required, but a majority of both the total number of regular graded courses and the total number of graduate courses must consist of courses offered by the Computer Science Department. No lower-division courses may be applied toward the M.S. degree. M.S. students should confer with their graduate advisor and capstone advisor to select which academic plan best fits their academic, research, and career goals. For both plans, all courses used must have been registered, enrolled and received a final grade of B-minus or higher (S/U will not count).  Please be sure to fulfill the three CS 201s before finishing the Program of Study. On average, MS students complete their course requirements in 5-6 quarters.\nPLAN II – CAPSTONE PLAN: In the Capstone Plan, 9 formal courses must be taken for letter grade and receive a final passing letter grade (B- or higher). Each course must be taken for 4 units each (no exceptions).  At least five (5) 4-unit courses must be 200-level courses in Computer Science. (Taken for letter grades). 500-level courses cannot be applied. The remaining four (4) 4-unit courses are elective courses, which may be 100- or 200-level courses in Computer Science or 200-level courses in a related discipline, i.e. Electrical Engineering, Statistics, Bioinformatics, etc.  Students should fulfill the MS Program of Study requirements first (including CS 201s).These 9 classes are in addition to the three CS 201 seminars.\nIn order to submit the capstone results form with all your advisor/committee signatures and abstract,  you must have advanced to candidacy and either  be registered and enrolled full-time (for summer you must be registered and enrolled for a minimum of 4 units) or have submitted a filing fee application by the deadline for the quarter you wish to be on filing fee. You cannot Advance to Candidacy and be on Filing Fee on the same quarter. If you plan to be on filing fee you must have submitted your Advancement to Candidacy packet on quarter prior. Information on the Advancement to Candidacy packet can be found HERE.\nCAPSTONE PROJECT: Students explore the scope and work out the expectations of the Capstone Project with their CS Faculty Advisor (it is up to the student to find their Capstone Faculty Advisor – must be CS faculty). The Capstone Project is presented for review by a three-person committee (the student must find two other committee members) . Two members, including the chair, must hold appointments in the UCLA Computer Science Department. The remaining member may be a faculty member from either Computer Science, another UCLA department, or another UC campus department. On average, students begin thinking about their research area/topic for their Capstone in 2-3 quarter in the program and begin working on their capstone in their 4th to 5th  quarter in the program.\nM.S. CAPSTONE PROJECT RESULTS: The Capstone Results Form can only be submitted if you have successfully Advanced to Candidacy (i.e. received an email from Academic Services stating you have Advanced to Candidacy). Results must be submitted to the CS Graduate Student Affairs Office no later than Friday of finals week of the quarter in which the M.S. degree is to be awarded. See the Graduate Program Deadlines (found here) for specific dates. Requirements for the Capstone Plan II results form is available at here.\nExamples of M.S. Capstone Projects:\nThe Petition for Advancement to Master’s Candidacy (ATC form which is included in the ATC packet) must be submitted to the CS Graduate Student Affairs Office (GSAO) in the quarter prior (you must be registered and enrolled and in good academic standing, i.e., GPA 3.0 and above in the quarter you are submitting the ATC packet) to when the student plans to be either on Filing Fee, or be registered and enrolled, and submitting the Capstone Project or M.S. Thesis. Please submit the ATC packet to the CS Grad Office no later than the end of 2nd week of the quarter you plan to Advance to Candidacy. Students must have completed or about to complete the Program of Study when they Advance to Candidacy.\nInstructions on submitting the ATC packet can be found on the CS Grad Notices MS section. You submit the ATC packet the quarter you are completing all of your coursework (do not submit it prior to that).\nA student must file the applicable Master’s Advancement to Candidacy packet with their major department no later than the Friday of second week of the quarter in which they plan to Advance to Candidacy (ATC).\nIf you are planning to ATC in the Summer you must be registered and enrolled in a course for 4 units during a summer session (A, B or C). You cannot drop this course at anytime.\nGSAO staff will verify course completion and grades at the end of the quarter. M.S. candidates have one calendar year from the date of advancement to candidacy in which to complete all requirements for the degree. If additional time is required, the student is responsible to resubmit their ATC packet by the deadline. Sample for the Advancement to Candidacy form can be found on the CS Grad Notices MS section.\nFor those finishing in Summer, in order to submit your capstone results form with all the signatures and abstract or uploading your thesis, you must be registered and enrolled for a minimum of 4 units or on filing fee.\nWhen students have completed all requirements for the M.S. degree (except the filing of either the Thesis or Capstone Project) and have Advanced to Candidacy, they are eligible to pay a Filing Fee during the quarter in which the degree is to be awarded instead of registering. Filing Fee is entirely optional. You must be registered and enrolled the quarter you plan to submit your Advancement to Candidacy (ATC) packet (hence most students submit the ATC packet the quarter prior to the one they plan to be on Filing fee). You cannot ATC nor take classes the same quarter you plan to be on filing fee.\nStudents who plan to go on filing fee must have already have secured their advisor + committee members and have already begun worked on their capstone/thesis project the quarter prior to going on filing fee.\nStudents may only use Filing Fee for one quarter. Many services are suspended while on Filing Fee including but not limited to access to the UCLA VPN and online services among other services. Please visit the Filing Fee website for more information. Therefore if you need access to University resources, students should register and enroll and not apply for Filing Fee. If you are on Filing Fee and will not finish that same quarter you are on Filing Fee, please contact Juliana Alvarez at jalvarez@cs.ucla.edu before week 10 of the quarter you are on Filing Fee.  If students on Filing Fee fail to complete their thesis or Capstone Project by Friday at the end of finals week (this includes procuring your advisor and committee signatures), they will need to apply for readmission into the CS MS program (no exceptions) and note readmission is not guaranteed.\nThe Master’s Filing Fee application (and deadline to submit the Filing Fee application) can be found on HERE. For Summer and Fall, the deadline is 10 business days prior to the last day of Summer Session C (except if the deadline falls on Labor Day; in these cases the deadline will be 9 business days). Information and instructions for completing the Master’s Filing Fee application for the current quarter are available at https://www.cs.ucla.edu/graduate-office-newsletter/\nFriendly reminder: only formally admitted M.S. students who applied for the M.S. program during admissions are allowed to obtain a degree in the CS M.S. program.\nTo maintain satisfactory academic progress, M.S. students must reach the milestones as established in the degree requirements outlined above, namely:\nThe maximum time to satisfactorily complete all M.S. requirements is 2 years or 6 quarters. Each quarter, the HSSEAS Dean’s Office evaluates the academic progress of all M.S. students. The majority of students are making satisfactory academic progress. Students not making satisfactory academic progress are notified and given corrective steps and time frames which will enable them to attain satisfactory academic progress.\nStudents who fail to meet requirements may be recommended for termination of graduate study. Graduate students may be disqualified from continuing in the graduate program for a variety of reasons. The most common is failure to maintain the minimum cumulative grade point average (3.00) required by the Academic Senate to remain in good standing. Other examples include failure of examinations, lack of timely progress toward the degree, and poor performance in core courses. Probationary students (those with cumulative grade point averages below 3.00) are subject to immediate dismissal upon the recommendation of their department. University guidelines governing the termination of graduate students, including the appeal procedure, are outlined in Standards and Procedures for Graduate Study at UCLA (found here). In addition to the standard reasons noted above, M.S. students may be recommended for termination for the following:\nThe selection of M.S. students who apply for admission into the Ph.D. program is a rigorous, internal process that identifies candidates who have demonstrated academic and research potential and achievement. The following application materials must be submitted to the CS Graduate Student Affairs Office (jalvarez@cs.ucla.edu) during the last term of full-time enrollment.\nStatement of purpose: Due no later than Week 2 of the last term of full-time enrollment.\nApplication for Admission to Ph.D. Program: Due no later than Week 2 of the last term of full-time enrollment.\nLetter of Recommendation: Statement from faculty advisor recommending admission and guaranteeing funding support for duration of graduate study and research. Due no later than Week 7 of the last term of full-time enrollment. Without the CS Faculty Advisor putting this in writing and giving it to the CS Student Grad Office, the student is unable to transition into the Ph.D. program.\nLetter of Recommendation Forms from faculty advisor and two other CS faculty. All must have evaluated either the student’s Capstone Project or Thesis. Due no later than Week 7 of the last term of full-time enrollment. The deadline for filing the M.S. thesis with the Young Research Library is Week 7 of the quarter. The deadline for filing the Capstone Project results with the CS Graduate Student Affair Office is also Week 7 of the quarter, which is 3 weeks earlier than the regular due date, to accommodate the processing and review of the application to the Ph.D. program. If all documents are submitted on or before the deadlines noted above and admission is offered, the effective term for classification as a Ph.D. student would be the term following the completion of all requirements for the M.S. degree, which includes submission of the M.S. thesis or Capstone Project.\nNormally, Ph.D. students take courses to acquire the knowledge needed to prepare for the written and oral preliminary examinations and for conducting research. The basic program of study is built around the following:\nTo maintain satisfactory academic progress, Ph.D. students must reach the degree milestones by the following deadlines:\nThe expected time to graduation of 6 years (18 quarters) accords with Graduate Division rules, which limit students to a maximum of 12 quarters as a teaching assistant and a maximum of 18 quarters combined as either a teaching assistant or research assistant.\nEach year at the end of spring quarter the entire faculty evaluates the academic progress of all Ph.D. students. A summary of each evaluation is sent by email to all students and their faculty advisors. These notifications indicate if the academic progress of students has been satisfactory or unsatisfactory.  By default the evaluations work as follows, but outcomes can differ based on the faculty discussion:\nStudents who fail to meet requirements may be recommended for termination of graduate study. Graduate students may be disqualified from continuing in the graduate program for a variety of reasons. The most common is failure to maintain the minimum cumulative grade point average (3.00) required by the Academic Senate to remain in good standing. Other examples include failure of examinations, lack of timely progress toward the degree, and poor performance in core courses. Probationary students (those with cumulative grade point averages below 3.00 or if the student’s work in any two consecutive terms fall below a 3.00) are subject to immediate dismissal upon the recommendation of their department. University guidelines governing the termination of graduate students, including the appeal procedure, are outlined in Standards and Procedures for Graduate Study at UCLA (found here).\nThe written qualifying examination (WQE) is the preliminary written examination for all Computer Science Ph.D. students in the Fall and Spring quarters only. The WQE consists of a high-quality paper, solely written by the student. The paper can be either a research paper containing an original contribution, or a focused critical survey paper. The paper should demonstrate the student’s understanding of the subject area, as well as their ability to integrate and communicate ideas clearly and concisely. To make satisfactory academic progress, students should take and pass the WQE no later than their 2nd year (6th quarter) of enrollment. Students must be enrolled during the quarter they take the WQE. Review the WQE requirements, submission procedures and deadlines.\nLENGTH: Maximum of 10 single-spaced pages.\nSTYLE: Suitable for submission to a first-rate technical conference or journal.\nCONTENT RESTRICTIONS: The paper must represent work that the student did as a graduate student at UCLA. Students must explicitly acknowledge in detail any contributions, including those of their faculty advisor, that are not their own. Any contributions to the paper that are not the student’s, including those of their advisor, must be explicitly acknowledged in detail. Specifically, on the first page of the WQE paper, in a separate paragraph at the end of the abstract, the student is required to specify, in detail, which parts of the paper represent the student’s own intellectual contributions. They also need to acknowledge that the paper is written entirely by the student. Any parts of the paper that are the contributions of others, including the advisor(s), must also be explicitly acknowledged in detail. There must be a separate sentence detailing the advisor’s contribution to the research and paper. In addition, there must be a different sentence describing the contributions of each co-author of the paper, if any.\nPREPARATION: An individual studies class, CS597B: Preparation for Ph.D. Preliminary Examination, is offered for variable units (2-12) and may be used to satisfy the minimum 12-unit course work requirement each quarter.\nSUBMISSION PROCESS: The paper must first be approved for submission by the student’s faculty advisor. Their signature on the WQE Cover Page is proof of approval. The WQE Cover Page then must be turned in to the Graduate Student Affairs Office at helen@cs.ucla.edu by the posted deadline. There are two deadlines a year for submission of papers, one in the fall quarter and the other in the spring quarter. Students are emailed a WQE announcement including dates and instructions after the start of the fall and the winter quarters.\nREVIEW PROCESS: After submission, the WQE will be reviewed by at least two other members of the faculty. Students will receive via email an evaluation and whether or not they have passed the WQE.\nNOTE: Ph.D. students who want to receive a master’s degree along the way may substitute a passing WQE for the master’s comprehensive examination.\nPhD students must complete at least three quarters of Computer Science 201 with grades of Satisfactory (in addition to the three quarters of CS 201 that may have been completed for the M.S. degree).\nCompletion of the seminars will be reviewed when students submit the Proposal of Fields form.\nStudents who plan to add the CS MS degree along the way must complete six quarters of COM SCI 201 with an ‘S’ grade.\nThe Proposal of Fields (POF) consists of one major field and two minor fields. The major field and at least one minor field must be in computer science. All major and minor field courses must be taken for a letter grade. To satisfy the major field requirement, students are expected to attain a body of knowledge contained in five courses, as well as the current literature in the area of specialization. In particular, students are required to take a minimum of three graduate courses in the major field of Ph.D. research, selecting these courses in accordance with guidelines specific to the major field. Grades of B-minus or better, with a grade-point average of at least 3.33 in all courses used to satisfy the major field requirement, are required. Students are required to satisfy the major field requirement by the end of their 3rd year (9th quarter) of enrollment and before taking the Oral Qualifying Examination (OQE). Each minor field normally embraces a body of knowledge equivalent to two courses, at least one of which is a graduate course. Grades of B-minus or better, with a grade-point average of at least 3.33 in all courses included in the minor field, are required. At least one minor field must be in computer science. Both minors must be completed prior to the OQE.\nSTANDARD PROPOSALS: Refer to the Proposal of Fields Guidelines for composing major and minor proposals in established fields. If the courses in a major or a minor field proposal adhere to these guidelines, the field will not require the signature of the corresponding field chair. The established fields are as follows: Artificial Intelligence, Computational Systems Biology, Computer System Architecture, Computer Science Theory, Data Science Computing, Graphics and Vision, Network Systems, and Software Systems.\nPROPOSALS WITH ONE OR MORE COURSE SUBSTITUTIONS: A major or a minor field proposal in an established field that deviates from the standard guidelines by one or more course substitutions must be approved by the corresponding field chair (who may consult with faculty in the field). The list of current Field Chairs is available on the last page of the Proposal of Fields Guidelines.\nTo submit a petition for a course not listed, send a separate email for each course requiring a petition to the field chair to review. Copy helen@cs.ucla.edu in each email. Include a brief justification for the substitution. Include the course syllabus and a transcript with the class marked or highlighted so the certifying instructor can quickly confirm.\nCOURSE WORK TAKEN AT OTHER INSTITUTIONS: No more than three equivalent or related graduate courses taken at other institutions may be applied to the major or minor field requirements, subject to the following:\nAD-HOC PROPOSAL: A major or minor field proposal that does not fall in one of the established fields is considered an ad-hoc field proposal. Guidelines for consideration follow:\nAD-HOC PROPOSAL SUBMISSION & APPROVAL PROCEDURES: The proposal for an ad-hoc field must be included in a completed Proposal of Fields and must be submitted together with a detailed, written justification explaining how the proposed ad-hoc field meets the requirements above and supports a research area. Include details on the proposed classes for the field (course description and/or course syllabus for each class). Email a scanned copy of the completed Proposal of Fields to Diana Valdes by Friday of Week 5. Refer to list of current Field Chairs. The subject line should read “Proposal for Ad-Hoc Field”. Approval of an ad-hoc field proposal requires a majority vote of the Academic Policy Committee (APC). The APC Chair, on behalf of the committee, will inform students and the CS Graduate Student Affairs Office by email when a decision is reached.\nThe POF form, guidelines, and procedures are available here: Proposal of Fields.\nCS Ph.D. students who have not earned previously a master’s in computer science, electrical engineering, or similar discipline AND have not advanced to candidacy for the PhD may be awarded an MS degree while working toward the PhD degree by fulfilling all the MS degree requirements. The MS degree and PhD degree may not be conferred in the same quarter, so the process should begin no later than the term in which the MS degree requirements are fulfilled. Students should confer with their faculty advisor about whether they should do a Thesis (Master’s Plan I) or a Capstone Plan (Master’s Plan II). A passed Written Qualifying Examination (WQE) may be substituted for the Capstone Project in Plan II.\nREQUIRED FORMS:\nDEADLINE:Submit all materials to jalvarez@cs.ucla.eduno later than Friday of Week 2 of the quarter in which the MS degree is to be awarded. If all documents and the thesis or comprehensive examination are submitted according to deadlines, the “degree awarded” date will be the graduation date of that term.\nOQE MILESTONE: After passing the WQE, students should form a doctoral committee and prepare to take the Oral Qualifying Examination (OQE). To make satisfactory academic progress, students should take and pass the OQE no later than the end of their 3rd year (9th quarter) of enrollment. The nature and content of the OQE are at the discretion of the doctoral committee, but generally the student gives a talk, followed by questions from the faculty.\nENROLLMENT REQUIREMENT: Students must be enrolled during the quarter they take the OQE. If students take the OQE in the summer, they must have been enrolled in at least 12 units in the preceding Spring quarter.\nADDING AN MS DEGREE ALONG THE WAY: PhD students who have not previously earned a master’s degree may add the MS degree in CS along the way. Students must submit a petition to add the MS degree before the OQE can be held. The MS degree cannot be added after the OQE. Additional instructions can be found in the “Adding an MS Degree Along the Way” section above.\nNOMINATING A DOCTORAL COMMITTEE: The Division of Graduate Education must approve the doctoral committee before the OQE can be held.\nHOW TO PREPARE: Students should familiarize themselves with the regulations for the doctoral qualifying examinations detailed in the Standards & Procedures for Graduate Study at UCLA (pages 15-18).\nORAL QUALIFYING EXAM – CHECKLIST REQUIREMENTS (DUE BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE CAN GO FORWARD)\nNOMINATE YOUR DOCTORAL COMMITTEE (6 WEEKS before exam)\nREMOTE REQUEST – IF NECESSARY (6 WEEKS BEFORE EXAM)\nSCHEDULE A ROOM (4 WEEKS BEFORE EXAM)\nSUBMIT PROSPECTUS TO DOCTORAL COMMITTEE (2 WEEKS BEFORE EXAM)\nAFTER YOU COMPLETE YOUR QUALS, the doctoral committee chair submits the Report on Oral Qualifying Exam to CS Graduate Student Affairs Office. Once the report is processed, you will be charged fees that total $90 (for your Candidacy for Doctoral Degree). We suggest you check your BruinBill 10-15 days after you complete your Quals.\nDue to various University Policies, failure to complete these steps without their allotted lead time (6 weeks, 4 weeks, and 2 weeks prior to your scheduled exam) may result in requiring you to reschedule your exam.\nAn individual studies class, CS597C: Preparation for Ph.D. Oral Qualifying Examination, is offered for variable units (2-12) and may be used to satisfy the minimum 12-unit requirement each quarter.\nNRST WAIVER: Beginning the quarter immediately after the OQE is passed, non-resident supplemental tuition (NRST) is waived for up to nine quarters. If nine quarters pass without the filing of the dissertation, non-resident tuition charges are reinstituted.\nAfter successfully completing the final defense, students are expected to soon be ready to file their dissertation. Students must follow the official UCLA manuscript preparation guide for Thesis and Dissertation Filing Requirements.  All Ph.D. students expecting to graduate in a given quarter are strongly encouraged to attend a dissertation filing workshop scheduled at the beginning of each quarter at the Charles E. Young Research Library.\nDOCTORAL FILING FEE: In the term that students intend to file their dissertation, they may apply for Filing Fee instead of enrolling for courses on the condition that they are completing only their dissertation. Filing fee status may be applied only for one quarter. If students on Filing Fee fail to complete their dissertation by the filing deadline, they must retroactively enroll and pay fees for that quarter. Information and instruction for completing the doctoral Filing Fee application and the Filing Fee application are available here. In approximately 10 business days, students should review their Bruin Bill account for a posting of a charge of $201 for the doctoral Filing Fee. Approximately 5 business days after fee payment, the filing date is posted on the transcript. If filed by the term’s dissertation deadline, the “degree awarded” date will be the graduation date of that term.\nDeadlines are posted in the Resources for Students page.\n(OPTIONAL) RECONSTITUTE your doctoral committee (6 WEEKS BEFORE EXAM)\nREMOTE PARTICIPATION OF A DOCTORAL COMMITTEE MEMBER (6 WEEKS BEFORE EXAM)\nSCHEDULE A DATE AND TIME FOR YOUR FINAL DEFENSE (4 WEEKS BEFORE EXAM)\nSUBMIT DRAFT OF DISSERTATION TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS (4 WEEKS BEFORE EXAM)\nFINAL DEFENSE REMINDER (1 WEEK BEFORE EXAM)\nDEFEND YOUR DISSERTATION\nFILE ONLINE\nGraduating CS Ph.D. students are eligible to participate in both the UCLA Doctoral Hooding Ceremony and the UCLA Samueli School of Engineering Commencement Ceremony.\nUCLA Doctoral Hooding Ceremony\nIn order to be eligible for the Spring doctoral hooding ceremony, Ph.D. students must file their dissertation in the preceding Summer, Fall, Winter, or Spring quarter. For example, if you would like to participate in the June 2025 ceremony, you must have filed your doctoral dissertation during Summer 2024, Fall 2024, Winter 2025, or Spring 2025.\nPhD students graduating in the Spring must file their dissertation by an earlier deadline in June if they would like to participate in the UCLA Doctoral Hooding Ceremony. The deadline is posted on the above website. Please note that “Complete Degree Requirements” includes: completion of the online ETD Filing Application, all committee members have reported approval of your manuscript and the passing of the final oral examination (if applicable) to the Division of Graduate Education; submission of a final PDF via ProQuest including requested changes from the Division of Graduate Education, and receipt of the Division of Graduate Education confirmation email of the formal completion of degree requirements.

Please review the TOP section below for more information on the CS policy.\nApplications for TAships are emailed to all Ph.D. students in May with an application deadline in June. Applicants who receive a tentative assignment for the next academic school year will be contacted with more information. In addition to the general requirements outlined above, TA assignments are determined by instructor preferences, advancement to candidacy, academic standing, student qualifications, funding obligations, and student preferences/qualifications/experience.\nIn addition to a salary, students who are assigned a TAship of 25% or higher, also receive paid benefits including health insurance, resident tuition, and remissible fees.\nFee remissions do not cover all graduate student fees. It is the responsibility of graduate students to ensure that those additional fees (non-remissible fees), are paid by the applicable Graduate Program Deadlines (listed at the Resources for Students page).\nStudents should take the ESLPE before the 1st quarter (summer). If students cannot take the exam in the summer, they may take the exam during the Fall in Week 2. The ESLPE test dates can be found on the ESLPE website. The exam will be offered up to 4 times in summer and in Week 2 of Fall quarter. There will be no exams offered in Winter or Spring.\nFailure to take the ESLPE in the first quarter will result in a hold on your MyUCLA records.\nNon-Passing (0.0 – 6.3):  Student is not permitted to TA and must take an approved ESL course for international TAs (310, 311, 312, or 313) before retaking the exam. The student may retake the exam while enrolled in the course.\nProvisional Pass (6.4 – 7.0):  Student is required to take a full 10-week approved ESL course for international TAs (ESL 310, 311, 312 or 313) before the first quarter of TA work. If the student successfully completes the ESL course with a passing grade, the student may serve as a TA without further testing or coursework. If the student does not pass the required ESL course, the student must take a second approved ESL course in a subsequent quarter and receive a passing grade in order to serve as TA. NOTE: If a student has fully or partially completed an approved course prior to receiving a marginal pass, this course is considered preparatory and does not satisfy the TOP requirement for a marginal pass. The TA must take another approved ESL course first.\nCS students who receive a Provisional Pass must enroll in an ESL oral skills course and then retake the exam with a 7.1 score or higher in order to be offered a CS TA position.\n\nClear Pass (7.1 – 10): The student is permitted to TA with no restrictions. Test takers who receive a clear pass are not permitted to retake the exam.\nExemptions:\nA student is exempt from taking the TOP if they have earned a prior undergraduate degree from an institution at which English was the sole language of instruction and which is located in a country where English is the primary spoken language of everyday life.\nAs of Fall 2024, an exemption is also granted to students who have a valid TOEFL-iBT speaking score of 28 or higher or an IELTS speaking score of 8.5 or higher.\nF1 international graduate students interested in CPT should review the CPT Guidelines on the Dashew Center’s website for more information.\nMS StudentsMS students must enroll in a COM SCI 596 course. Request permission to enroll in CS 596 from the faculty advisor prior to enrolling. For Summer CPT, request permission to enroll in 596 from the faculty advisor. Forward the email approval to Juliana Alvarez at jalvarez@cs.ucla.edu who will manually enroll you in the course.\nPhD Students\nSummer CPTCS MS and PhD students enrolling in summer courses will be responsible for paying summer registration and fees by the Summer Session deadline.

An “unsatisfactory progress, subject to dismissal” evaluation may also affect a student’s eligibility for a TA assignment.\n• If a course taken at another institution is included in a major or minor field proposal, and falls within an established field, the proposal will be considered a deviation from the standard guidelines and must be approved by the corresponding field chair.\n• The graduate course must be taken while a graduate student.\n• The graduate course cannot have been applied toward an undergraduate degree.\n• The department must approve all proposals for an ad-hoc field. Students are strongly encouraged to submit their ad-hoc proposal for approval BEFORE taking any of the proposed courses.\n• The ad-hoc field should be a coherent set of courses in an identifiable area (body of knowledge) that is not a subfield of the area of the major or the minors. The ad-hoc field should provide a perspective that is different from the other fields. It cannot merely be a collection of three useful classes.\n• If the ad-hoc field presents some overlap with topics that are generally associated with the other fields, the student must provide a justification that carefully explains why this overlap does not impinge on the value of the minor to broadening the academic experience. (If the Academic Policy Committee [APC] finds such an overlap, the students may be required to provide more information.)\n• Ad-hoc minor cannot include courses that are listed either as core or ancillary of other proposed major and minor. For example, a proposal with the DSC major cannot include any courses listed in the DSC core and ancillary lists in the ad-hoc minor.\n• Complete the Advancement to Candidacy Petition.

Rename this file to “Your Name MS Capstone Form” (i.e. Joe Bruin Capstone Form).\n• Do I need to pass the WQE before adding the MS degree? No, you may take the WQE in the same quarter you want to add the MS degree. Awarding of the MS degree will be contingent upon you passing the WQE. Students may indicate on the required MS forms above that the WQE is currently in progress.\n• Do I need to finish 9 courses and six CS 201s a quarter before adding the MS degree? No, you may take your remaining courses in-progress and add the MS degree in the same quarter. Students must show they are enrolled in the last course(s) needed to complete the MS program of study. Awarding of the MS degree will be contingent upon you passing the final course(s). Students may indicate on the required MS forms above which course(s) are currently in progress.\n• Are the course requirements the same for the CS MS and PhD degrees? While both degrees require 9 courses and the 9 courses may (often do) overlap, students should ensure they are satisfying both requirements separately. The MS degree requires a certain number of 200-level CS courses and electives within CS or Engineering. While the Proposal of Fields may allow graduate course substitutions from other universities or other departments, the MS degree does not. Therefore, students are encouraged to review both sets of requirements to ensure their course selections satisfy both degrees. The MS degree requires students to take their 9 courses as a graduate student at UCLA.\n• I don’t plan to advance to candidacy (ATC) or do my Oral Qualifying Exam (OQE) yet. When should I add the MS degree? The master’s ATC and the doctoral ATC are two separate procedures. The master’s ATC (if students wish to add the MS degree) must occur before the doctoral ATC. To ATC for the master’s degree, PhD students typically take six CS 201s, complete the MS program of study, and the WQE. Students should add the MS degree in the quarter they are taking their last MS course requirement(s) and/or WQE. To ATC for the doctoral degree, PhD students must finish their Proposal of Fields and pass the Oral Qualifying Exam.\n• May I add the MS degree and do my OQE in the same quarter? Yes, as long as 1) the required forms for the master’s ATC are submitted by Friday of Week 2 and 2) you have completed the PhD Proposal of Fields, you may add the MS degree and do the OQE in the same quarter if necessary. The university policy is that the MS ATC must occur the PhD ATC. The official MS ATC confirmation email is typically sent to students during the middle of the quarter. Thus, students who wish to do the OQE in the same quarter are encouraged to schedule the OQE in the second half of the quarter so that the PhD ATC occurs after.\n• 3 quarters of COM SCI 201 Seminars with ‘S’ grades only.

It supplements the UCLA General Catalog.\nThe Standards and Procedures for Graduate Study at UCLA, which frequently is cited in this handbook, provides detailed information and sets forth general policies, many of which come from the Academic Senate and its Graduate Council, regarding completion of degree requirements, master’s and doctoral committees, examinations and foreign language requirements. Also included are general regulations concerning graduate courses, standards of scholarship, leaves of absence, normal progress toward degree, and a number of other matters.\nThe content of this handbook is subject to revision. Students should regularly check their CS email account, as most changes in regulations will be sent via email. However, courses, course descriptions, instructor designations, curricular degree requirements, and fees described herein are subject to change or deletion without notice. In all matters, the rules and regulations of the UCLA General Catalog and the Standards and Procedures for Graduate Study at UCLA shall supersede this handbook.\nWe invite you to read and familiarize yourself with the contents of this handbook, and hope it allows you to make your journey at UCLA both smooth and successful.\nIf you are a CS PhD student (both new and continuing PhD students) and have any questions or concerns throughout your tenure in the PhD program at UCLA, please contact Helen Tran at helen@cs.ucla.edu\nIf you are a CS MS student (both new and continuing MS students) and have any questions or concerns throughout your tenure in the MS program at UCLA, please contact Juliana Alvarez at jalvarez@cs.ucla.edu\nMaster of Science Program\n \n\nFields of Study\nOnly formally admitted M.S. students who applied for the M.S. program during admissions are allowed to obtain a degree in the CS M.S. program.\nMS students are not required to select a major field.

The initial faculty advisor is not your official capstone/thesis advisor. They are there to answer general questions on the capstone or thesis in general.\nCapstone/Thesis Advisor: It is the MS students responsibility to find an official capstone/thesis advisor. Most students start to find their capstone/thesis advisor once they know the research area/topic they wish to work on (on average towards the end of the second quarter /beginning of the 3rd quarter in the MS program – the MS program is a 2 year program) The capstone/thesis advisor must be CS faculty. Once you find a CS faculty member who is willing to serve as your capstone/thesis advisor, the student must fill out the advisor consent form and have their capstone/thesis advisor sign off on the form and then it is emailed to Juliana Alvarez at jalvarez@cs.ucla.edu. Friendly reminder it is the student’s responsibility to also find their two other committee members as well as their advisor.\nFor a list of CS faculty associated with research areas please click HERE.\n \n\nCom Sci 201 Seminar Requirement\n\n\nMS students must complete at least three quarters of Computer Science 201 with grades of Satisfactory (in addition to the three quarters of CS 201 that may have been completed for the M.S. degree). CS 201 can only be taken while registered and enrolled in the MS program (you cannot take this class while registered and enrolled as an undergrad student).\nCompletion of the seminars will be reviewed when students submit the Program of Study Form.\nCS PhD students who plan to add the CS MS degree along the way must complete six quarters of COM SCI 201 with an ‘S’ grade.\n\n\n\nProposed M.S.

Proposed Program of Study by the end of their 1st term in enrollment at UCLA. Students may submit the form to the CS Graduate Student Affairs Office with coursework in progress or planned for a future quarter. A total of nine courses (each course must be taken for 4 units max and a receive a final passing letter grade of B- or higher) are required for the M.S. degree, including a minimum of five graduate courses. No specific courses are required, but a majority of both the total number of regular graded courses and the total number of graduate courses must consist of courses offered by the Computer Science Department. No lower-division courses may be applied toward the M.S. degree. M.S. students should confer with their faculty advisor to select which academic plan best fits their academic, research, and career goals. For both plans, all courses used must have been registered, enrolled and received a final grade of B-minus or higher (S/U will not count).  Please be sure to fulfill the three CS 201s before finishing the Program of Study. On average, MS students complete the coursework in 5-6 quarters.\nIn order to submit your official MS thesis electronically via DG ETD system,  you must have advanced to candidacy (this includes having submitted your ATC packet which should include the MS Nomination of Thesis Committee Form), attended an ETD workshop and either  be registered and enrolled full-time (for summer you must be registered and enrolled for a minimum of 4 units) or have submitted a filing fee application by the deadline for the quarter you wish to be on filing fee. You cannot Advance to Candidacy and be on Filing Fee at the same time. If you are planning to do filing fee you must submit your Advancement to Candidacy packet one quarter prior to the quarter you plan to be on filing fee (no exceptions). Information on the ATC packet can be found HERE.\nPLAN I – THESIS: In the thesis plan, seven (7) 4-unit courses must be formal courses (taken for letter grades), and at least 4 of the 7 must be 200-level courses in Computer Science. 2 courses (or 8 units) must be CS 598, which involves work on the thesis. The remaining three (3) 4-unit courses are elective courses, which may be 100- or 200-level courses in Computer Science or 200-level courses in a related discipline, i.e. Electrical Engineering, Statistics, Bioinformatics, etc.  You must also take CS 598 for 4 units twice or sign up for CS 598 for 8 units total. Prior to signing up for CS 598 please obtain the consent of your faculty advisor that you are signing up under them for this course. Please note you still need to fulfill the three CS 201 seminars in addition to the 9 classes.\nMASTER’S THESIS COMMITTEE: A Master’s Thesis Committee must be approved by the Graduate Division before the submission of the Petition for Advancement to Candidacy. It is the student’s responsibility to find their thesis advisor/chair plus the two other committee members.  The advisor/chair plus committee members listed on the Nomination of Master’s Committee form (which is submitted with the ATC packet the quarter students are finishing their coursework) must have given their consent prior to the student listing them on the Nomination of Master’s Committee form. The committee consists of a minimum of three members. Two members, including the chair, must hold appointments in the UCLA Computer Science Department (your Chair or Advisor for your thesis must be CS faculty). The remaining member may be a faculty member from either Computer Science, another UCLA department, or another UC campus department. The Master’s Thesis committee regulations and the nomination form are available at: www.gdnet.ucla.edu/gasaa/library/masnomin.pdf\nMASTER’S THESIS: The thesis is a report on the results of student investigation of a problem in the major field of study under the supervision of the thesis committee, which approves the subject and plan of the thesis and reads and approves the complete manuscript. While the problem may be one of only limited scope, the thesis must exhibit a satisfactory style, organization, and depth of understanding of the subject. Students should normally start to plan the thesis at least one year before the award of the M.S. degree. There is no examination under the thesis plan. It is the student’s responsibility to attend an ETD workshop and review the information o the ETD webpage at least one quarter prior (if not earlier) to the one they plan to submit their thesis. On average, students begin thinking about their research area/topic for their Thesis  in 2-3 quarter in the program and begin working on their Thesis in their 4th to 5th  quarter in the program.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProposed M.S.

Students must have completed or about to complete the Program of Study when they Advance to Candidacy.\nInstructions on submitting the ATC packet can be found on the CS Grad Notices MS section. You submit the ATC packet the quarter you are completing all of your coursework (do not submit it prior to that).\nA student must file the applicable Master’s Advancement to Candidacy packet with their major department no later than the Friday of second week of the quarter in which they plan to Advance to Candidacy (ATC).\nIf you are planning to ATC in the Summer you must be registered and enrolled in a course for 4 units during a summer session (A, B or C). You cannot drop this course at anytime.\nGSAO staff will verify course completion and grades at the end of the quarter. M.S. candidates have one calendar year from the date of advancement to candidacy in which to complete all requirements for the degree. If additional time is required, the student is responsible to resubmit their ATC packet by the deadline. Sample for the Advancement to Candidacy form can be found on the CS Grad Notices MS section.\nFor those finishing in Summer, in order to submit your capstone results form with all the signatures and abstract or uploading your thesis, you must be registered and enrolled for a minimum of 4 units or on filing fee.\nMaster’s Filing Fee\nWhen students have completed all requirements for the M.S. degree (except the filing of either the Thesis or Capstone Project) and have Advanced to Candidacy, they are eligible to pay a Filing Fee during the quarter in which the degree is to be awarded instead of registering. Filing Fee is entirely optional. You must be registered and enrolled the quarter you plan to submit your Advancement to Candidacy (ATC) packet (hence most students submit the ATC packet the quarter prior to the one they plan to be on Filing fee). You cannot ATC nor take classes the same quarter you plan to be on filing fee.\nStudents who plan to go on filing fee must have already have secured their advisor + committee members and have already begun worked on their capstone/thesis project the quarter prior to going on filing fee.\nStudents may only use Filing Fee for one quarter. Many services are suspended while on Filing Fee including but not limited to access to the UCLA VPN and online services among other services. Please visit the Filing Fee website for more information. Therefore if you need access to University resources, students should register and enroll and not apply for Filing Fee. If you are on Filing Fee and will not finish that same quarter you are on Filing Fee, please contact Juliana Alvarez at jalvarez@cs.ucla.edu before week 10 of the quarter you are on Filing Fee.  If students on Filing Fee fail to complete their thesis or Capstone Project by Friday at the end of finals week (this includes procuring your advisor and committee signatures), they will need to apply for readmission into the CS MS program (no exceptions) and note readmission is not guaranteed.\nThe Master’s Filing Fee application (and deadline to submit the Filing Fee application) can be found on HERE. For Summer and Fall, the deadline is 10 business days prior to the last day of Summer Session C (except if the deadline falls on Labor Day; in these cases the deadline will be 9 business days).

Each quarter, the HSSEAS Dean’s Office evaluates the academic progress of all M.S. students. The majority of students are making satisfactory academic progress. Students not making satisfactory academic progress are notified and given corrective steps and time frames which will enable them to attain satisfactory academic progress.\nMS students must be enrolled in a minimum of 12 units. If you have further questions regarding this, please contact Juliana Alvarez at jalvarez@cs.ucla.edu\nStudents who fail to meet requirements may be recommended for termination of graduate study. Graduate students may be disqualified from continuing in the graduate program for a variety of reasons. The most common is failure to maintain the minimum cumulative grade point average (3.00) required by the Academic Senate to remain in good standing. Other examples include failure of examinations, lack of timely progress toward the degree, and poor performance in core courses. Probationary students (those with cumulative grade point averages below 3.00) are subject to immediate dismissal upon the recommendation of their department. University guidelines governing the termination of graduate students, including the appeal procedure, are outlined in Standards and Procedures for Graduate Study at UCLA (found here). In addition to the standard reasons noted above, M.S. students may be recommended for termination for the following:\n\nFailure to maintain satisfactory progress toward the degree within the two-year time limit for completing all degree requirements.\nFailure to maintain a grade point average of 3.0 in all courses and in those in the 200 series.\nFailure to maintain a grade point average of 3.0 in any two consecutive terms.\nFailure of the comprehensive examination.\nFailure to complete the thesis to the satisfaction of the committee members.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM.S. Students Applying To Ph.D. Program\n\n\n\n\n\nThe selection of M.S. students who apply for admission into the Ph.D. program is a rigorous, internal process that identifies candidates who have demonstrated academic and research potential and achievement.

The basic program of study is built around the following:\n\nWritten Qualifying Examination (WQE) \nCOM SCI 201 Seminar Requirement (3 quarters)\nProposal of Fields (POF)\nAd-hoc Checklist (if applicable)\nOral Qualifying Examination (OQE) and Advancement to Candidacy (ATC)\nFinal Oral Examination on the Dissertation (Final Defense)\nFiling the Doctoral Dissertation\n\n\n\nAcademic Progress Requirements (Time-to-Degree)\n\n\n\n\n\nTo maintain satisfactory academic progress, Ph.D. students must reach the degree milestones by the following deadlines:\n\nWritten Qualifying Exam:  End of 2nd year (6th quarter)\nCOM SCI 201 Seminar Requirement:  End of 3rd year (9th quarter)\nProposal of Fields:  End of 3rd Year (9th quarter)\nOral Qualifying Exam:  End of 3rd year (9th quarter) Missing this OQE milestone by the 12th quarter will result in an Unsatisfactory outcome in the PhD progress report.\nFinal Defense:  End of 6th year (18th quarter)\n\nThe expected time to graduation of 6 years (18 quarters) accords with Graduate Division rules, which limit students to a maximum of 12 quarters as a teaching assistant and a maximum of 18 quarters combined as either a teaching assistant or research assistant.\nEach year at the end of spring quarter the entire faculty evaluates the academic progress of all Ph.D. students. A summary of each evaluation is sent by email to all students and their faculty advisors. These notifications indicate if the academic progress of students has been satisfactory or unsatisfactory.  By default the evaluations work as follows, but outcomes can differ based on the faculty discussion:\n\nA student who has completed all milestones that are required based on their length of time in the program receives an evaluation of “satisfactory progress.”\nA student who fails to meet one of the above deadlines for the first time receives an evaluation of “unsatisfactory progress.”\nThe student is typically given six months to complete the milestone and is re-evaluated at that point.\nA student who fails to meet the deadline required by a prior evaluation of “unsatisfactory progress” receives an evaluation of “unsatisfactory progress, subject to dismissal.”  The student is typically given six more months to complete the milestone and is notified that they are subject to dismissal from the Ph.D. program if this deadline is not met.\nA student who fails to meet the deadline required by a prior evaluation of “unsatisfactory progress, subject to dismissal” will be discussed by the faculty.  Based on input from the student’s faculty advisor and other information, the faculty may vote to dismiss the student from the Ph.D. program, or they may decide to give the student one more chance and send another “unsatisfactory progress, subject to dismissal” letter. An “unsatisfactory progress, subject to dismissal” evaluation may also affect a student’s eligibility for a TA assignment.\n\nStudents who fail to meet requirements may be recommended for termination of graduate study. Graduate students may be disqualified from continuing in the graduate program for a variety of reasons. The most common is failure to maintain the minimum cumulative grade point average (3.00) required by the Academic Senate to remain in good standing. Other examples include failure of examinations, lack of timely progress toward the degree, and poor performance in core courses. Probationary students (those with cumulative grade point averages below 3.00 or if the student’s work in any two consecutive terms fall below a 3.00) are subject to immediate dismissal upon the recommendation of their department. University guidelines governing the termination of graduate students, including the appeal procedure, are outlined in Standards and Procedures for Graduate Study at UCLA (found here).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWritten Qualifying Exam (WQE)\n\nThe written qualifying examination (WQE) is the preliminary written examination for all Computer Science Ph.D. students in the Fall and Spring quarters only. The WQE consists of a high-quality paper, solely written by the student. The paper can be either a research paper containing an original contribution, or a focused critical survey paper. The paper should demonstrate the student’s understanding of the subject area, as well as their ability to integrate and communicate ideas clearly and concisely. To make satisfactory academic progress, students should take and pass the WQE no later than their 2nd year (6th quarter) of enrollment. Students must be enrolled during the quarter they take the WQE. Review the WQE requirements, submission procedures and deadlines.\nLENGTH: Maximum of 10 single-spaced pages.\nSTYLE: Suitable for submission to a first-rate technical conference or journal.\nCONTENT RESTRICTIONS: The paper must represent work that the student did as a graduate student at UCLA. Students must explicitly acknowledge in detail any contributions, including those of their faculty advisor, that are not their own. Any contributions to the paper that are not the student’s, including those of their advisor, must be explicitly acknowledged in detail. Specifically, on the first page of the WQE paper, in a separate paragraph at the end of the abstract, the student is required to specify, in detail, which parts of the paper represent the student’s own intellectual contributions. They also need to acknowledge that the paper is written entirely by the student. Any parts of the paper that are the contributions of others, including the advisor(s), must also be explicitly acknowledged in detail. There must be a separate sentence detailing the advisor’s contribution to the research and paper. In addition, there must be a different sentence describing the contributions of each co-author of the paper, if any.\nPREPARATION: An individual studies class, CS597B: Preparation for Ph.D. Preliminary Examination, is offered for variable units (2-12) and may be used to satisfy the minimum 12-unit course work requirement each quarter.\nSUBMISSION PROCESS: The paper must first be approved for submission by the student’s faculty advisor. Their signature on the WQE Cover Page is proof of approval. The WQE Cover Page then must be turned in to the Graduate Student Affairs Office at helen@cs.ucla.edu by the posted deadline. There are two deadlines a year for submission of papers, one in the fall quarter and the other in the spring quarter. Students are emailed a WQE announcement including dates and instructions after the start of the fall and the winter quarters.\nREVIEW PROCESS: After submission, the WQE will be reviewed by at least two other members of the faculty. Students will receive via email an evaluation and whether or not they have passed the WQE.\nNOTE: Ph.D. students who want to receive a master’s degree along the way may substitute a passing WQE for the master’s comprehensive examination.\n\n\nCOM SCI 201 Seminar Requirement\n\nPhD students must complete at least three quarters of Computer Science 201 with grades of Satisfactory (in addition to the three quarters of CS 201 that may have been completed for the M.S. degree).\nCompletion of the seminars will be reviewed when students submit the Proposal of Fields form.\nStudents who plan to add the CS MS degree along the way must complete six quarters of COM SCI 201 with an ‘S’ grade.\n\n\nProposal of Fields (POF)\n\n\nThe Proposal of Fields (POF) consists of one major field and two minor fields. The major field and at least one minor field must be in computer science. All major and minor field courses must be taken for a letter grade. To satisfy the major field requirement, students are expected to attain a body of knowledge contained in five courses, as well as the current literature in the area of specialization. In particular, students are required to take a minimum of three graduate courses in the major field of Ph.D. research, selecting these courses in accordance with guidelines specific to the major field. Grades of B-minus or better, with a grade-point average of at least 3.33 in all courses used to satisfy the major field requirement, are required. Students are required to satisfy the major field requirement by the end of their 3rd year (9th quarter) of enrollment and before taking the Oral Qualifying Examination (OQE). Each minor field normally embraces a body of knowledge equivalent to two courses, at least one of which is a graduate course. Grades of B-minus or better, with a grade-point average of at least 3.33 in all courses included in the minor field, are required. At least one minor field must be in computer science. Both minors must be completed prior to the OQE.\nSTANDARD PROPOSALS: Refer to the Proposal of Fields Guidelines for composing major and minor proposals in established fields. If the courses in a major or a minor field proposal adhere to these guidelines, the field will not require the signature of the corresponding field chair. The established fields are as follows: Artificial Intelligence, Computational Systems Biology, Computer System Architecture, Computer Science Theory, Data Science Computing, Graphics and Vision, Network Systems, and Software Systems.\nPROPOSALS WITH ONE OR MORE COURSE SUBSTITUTIONS: A major or a minor field proposal in an established field that deviates from the standard guidelines by one or more course substitutions must be approved by the corresponding field chair (who may consult with faculty in the field). The list of current Field Chairs is available on the last page of the Proposal of Fields Guidelines.\nTo submit a petition for a course not listed, send a separate email for each course requiring a petition to the field chair to review. Copy helen@cs.ucla.edu in each email. Include a brief justification for the substitution. Include the course syllabus and a transcript with the class marked or highlighted so the certifying instructor can quickly confirm.\nCOURSE WORK TAKEN AT OTHER INSTITUTIONS: No more than three equivalent or related graduate courses taken at other institutions may be applied to the major or minor field requirements, subject to the following:\n\nIf a course taken at another institution is included in a major or minor field proposal, and falls within an established field, the proposal will be considered a deviation from the standard guidelines and must be approved by the corresponding field chair.\nThe graduate course must be taken while a graduate student.\nThe graduate course cannot have been applied toward an undergraduate degree.\n\nAD-HOC PROPOSAL: A major or minor field proposal that does not fall in one of the established fields is considered an ad-hoc field proposal. Guidelines for consideration follow:\n\nThe department must approve all proposals for an ad-hoc field. Students are strongly encouraged to submit their ad-hoc proposal for approval BEFORE taking any of the proposed courses.\nThe ad-hoc field should be a coherent set of courses in an identifiable area (body of knowledge) that is not a subfield of the area of the major or the minors. The ad-hoc field should provide a perspective that is different from the other fields. It cannot merely be a collection of three useful classes.\nIf the ad-hoc field presents some overlap with topics that are generally associated with the other fields, the student must provide a justification that carefully explains why this overlap does not impinge on the value of the minor to broadening the academic experience. (If the Academic Policy Committee [APC] finds such an overlap, the students may be required to provide more information.)\nAd-hoc minor cannot include courses that are listed either as core or ancillary of other proposed major and minor. For example, a proposal with the DSC major cannot include any courses listed in the DSC core and ancillary lists in the ad-hoc minor.\n\nAD-HOC PROPOSAL SUBMISSION & APPROVAL PROCEDURES: The proposal for an ad-hoc field must be included in a completed Proposal of Fields and must be submitted together with a detailed, written justification explaining how the proposed ad-hoc field meets the requirements above and supports a research area. Include details on the proposed classes for the field (course description and/or course syllabus for each class). Email a scanned copy of the completed Proposal of Fields to Diana Valdes by Friday of Week 5. Refer to list of current Field Chairs. The subject line should read “Proposal for Ad-Hoc Field”. Approval of an ad-hoc field proposal requires a majority vote of the Academic Policy Committee (APC). The APC Chair, on behalf of the committee, will inform students and the CS Graduate Student Affairs Office by email when a decision is reached.\nThe POF form, guidelines, and procedures are available here: Proposal of Fields.\n\n\n\nAdding an MS Degree Along the Way\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCS Ph.D. students who have not earned previously a master’s in computer science, electrical engineering, or similar discipline AND have not advanced to candidacy for the PhD may be awarded an MS degree while working toward the PhD degree by fulfilling all the MS degree requirements. The MS degree and PhD degree may not be conferred in the same quarter, so the process should begin no later than the term in which the MS degree requirements are fulfilled. Students should confer with their faculty advisor about whether they should do a Thesis (Master’s Plan I) or a Capstone Plan (Master’s Plan II). A passed Written Qualifying Examination (WQE) may be substituted for the Capstone Project in Plan II.\nREQUIRED FORMS:\n\nComplete the Advancement to Candidacy Petition. Use instructions on page 1 of this form to fill out the ATC petition. Only the student signature is required. The Grad Office will approve and sign the ATC form.\nDownload a copy of your unofficial transcript and highlight the 9 courses used toward the MS Program of Study. Then merge the transcripts starting on page 2 of the ATC petition. #1 and #2 should be one, single PDF file. Rename this file to “MS, Yourlastname YourUID” (i.e. MS, Bruin 123456789).\nPhD adding MS Degree form (page 2) and Proposed MS Program Study (page 3). If you are taking the WQE in the same quarter you are adding the MS degree, enter the quarter you are taking the WQE. If CS 201 or any other courses are currently in progress in the quarter you are adding the MS degree, mark the grade as “TBD.” We will take care of the necessary signatures. Rename this file to “Your Name PhDAddingMS” (i.e. Joe Bruin PhDAddingMS).\nM.S. Capstone Project Results Form (if Plan II is chosen). If applicable, please note on this form that If the WQE is being substituted for the Capstone Project. Committee signatures should be left blank since you are PhD student using the WQE instead. Rename this file to “Your Name MS Capstone Form” (i.e. Joe Bruin Capstone Form).\n\n\n\nDEADLINE:Submit all materials to jalvarez@cs.ucla.eduno later than Friday of Week 2 of the quarter in which the MS degree is to be awarded. If all documents and the thesis or comprehensive examination are submitted according to deadlines, the “degree awarded” date will be the graduation date of that term.\nFAQ:\n\nDo I need to pass the WQE before adding the MS degree? No, you may take the WQE in the same quarter you want to add the MS degree. Awarding of the MS degree will be contingent upon you passing the WQE. Students may indicate on the required MS forms above that the WQE is currently in progress.\nDo I need to finish 9 courses and six CS 201s a quarter before adding the MS degree? No, you may take your remaining courses in-progress and add the MS degree in the same quarter. Students must show they are enrolled in the last course(s) needed to complete the MS program of study. Awarding of the MS degree will be contingent upon you passing the final course(s). Students may indicate on the required MS forms above which course(s) are currently in progress.\nAre the course requirements the same for the CS MS and PhD degrees? While both degrees require 9 courses and the 9 courses may (often do) overlap, students should ensure they are satisfying both requirements separately. The MS degree requires a certain number of 200-level CS courses and electives within CS or Engineering. While the Proposal of Fields may allow graduate course substitutions from other universities or other departments, the MS degree does not. Therefore, students are encouraged to review both sets of requirements to ensure their course selections satisfy both degrees. The MS degree requires students to take their 9 courses as a graduate student at UCLA.\nI don’t plan to advance to candidacy (ATC) or do my Oral Qualifying Exam (OQE) yet. When should I add the MS degree? The master’s ATC and the doctoral ATC are two separate procedures. The master’s ATC (if students wish to add the MS degree) must occur before the doctoral ATC. To ATC for the master’s degree, PhD students typically take six CS 201s, complete the MS program of study, and the WQE. Students should add the MS degree in the quarter they are taking their last MS course requirement(s) and/or WQE. To ATC for the doctoral degree, PhD students must finish their Proposal of Fields and pass the Oral Qualifying Exam.\nMay I add the MS degree and do my OQE in the same quarter? Yes, as long as 1) the required forms for the master’s ATC are submitted by Friday of Week 2 and 2) you have completed the PhD Proposal of Fields, you may add the MS degree and do the OQE in the same quarter if necessary. The university policy is that the MS ATC must occur the PhD ATC. The official MS ATC confirmation email is typically sent to students during the middle of the quarter. Thus, students who wish to do the OQE in the same quarter are encouraged to schedule the OQE in the second half of the quarter so that the PhD ATC occurs after.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOral Qualifying Exam (OQE) & Advancement To Candidacy (ATC)\n\n\n\nOQE MILESTONE: After passing the WQE, students should form a doctoral committee and prepare to take the Oral Qualifying Examination (OQE). To make satisfactory academic progress, students should take and pass the OQE no later than the end of their 3rd year (9th quarter) of enrollment. The nature and content of the OQE are at the discretion of the doctoral committee, but generally the student gives a talk, followed by questions from the faculty.\nENROLLMENT REQUIREMENT: Students must be enrolled during the quarter they take the OQE. If students take the OQE in the summer, they must have been enrolled in at least 12 units in the preceding Spring quarter.\nADDING AN MS DEGREE ALONG THE WAY: PhD students who have not previously earned a master’s degree may add the MS degree in CS along the way. Students must submit a petition to add the MS degree before the OQE can be held. The MS degree cannot be added after the OQE. Additional instructions can be found in the “Adding an MS Degree Along the Way” section above.\nNOMINATING A DOCTORAL COMMITTEE: The Division of Graduate Education must approve the doctoral committee before the OQE can be held.\nHOW TO PREPARE: Students should familiarize themselves with the regulations for the doctoral qualifying examinations detailed in the Standards & Procedures for Graduate Study at UCLA (pages 15-18).\nORAL QUALIFYING EXAM – CHECKLIST REQUIREMENTS (DUE BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE CAN GO FORWARD)\n\n3 quarters of COM SCI 201 Seminars with ‘S’ grades only.

We suggest you check your BruinBill 10-15 days after you complete your Quals.\nDue to various University Policies, failure to complete these steps without their allotted lead time (6 weeks, 4 weeks, and 2 weeks prior to your scheduled exam) may result in requiring you to reschedule your exam.\nAn individual studies class, CS597C: Preparation for Ph.D. Oral Qualifying Examination, is offered for variable units (2-12) and may be used to satisfy the minimum 12-unit requirement each quarter.\nNRST WAIVER: Beginning the quarter immediately after the OQE is passed, non-resident supplemental tuition (NRST) is waived for up to nine quarters. If nine quarters pass without the filing of the dissertation, non-resident tuition charges are reinstituted.\n\n\n\n\nDoctoral Dissertation and Filing Fee\n\n\n\n\nAfter successfully completing the final defense, students are expected to soon be ready to file their dissertation. Students must follow the official UCLA manuscript preparation guide for Thesis and Dissertation Filing Requirements.  All Ph.D. students expecting to graduate in a given quarter are strongly encouraged to attend a dissertation filing workshop scheduled at the beginning of each quarter at the Charles E. Young Research Library.\nDOCTORAL FILING FEE: In the term that students intend to file their dissertation, they may apply for Filing Fee instead of enrolling for courses on the condition that they are completing only their dissertation. Filing fee status may be applied only for one quarter. If students on Filing Fee fail to complete their dissertation by the filing deadline, they must retroactively enroll and pay fees for that quarter. Information and instruction for completing the doctoral Filing Fee application and the Filing Fee application are available here. In approximately 10 business days, students should review their Bruin Bill account for a posting of a charge of $201 for the doctoral Filing Fee. Approximately 5 business days after fee payment, the filing date is posted on the transcript. If filed by the term’s dissertation deadline, the “degree awarded” date will be the graduation date of that term.\nDeadlines are posted in the Resources for Students page.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Defense Checklist\n (OPTIONAL) RECONSTITUTE your doctoral committee (6 WEEKS BEFORE EXAM)\n\nIf you need to add or change a committee member: Complete the RECONSTITUTION OF COMMITTEE FORM.

For example, if you would like to participate in the June 2025 ceremony, you must have filed your doctoral dissertation during Summer 2024, Fall 2024, Winter 2025, or Spring 2025.\nPhD students graduating in the Spring must file their dissertation by an earlier deadline in June if they would like to participate in the UCLA Doctoral Hooding Ceremony. The deadline is posted on the above website. Please note that “Complete Degree Requirements” includes: completion of the online ETD Filing Application, all committee members have reported approval of your manuscript and the passing of the final oral examination (if applicable) to the Division of Graduate Education; submission of a final PDF via ProQuest including requested changes from the Division of Graduate Education, and receipt of the Division of Graduate Education confirmation email of the formal completion of degree requirements. Students should keep in mind that there is a high volume of submissions around this time and that formatting revisions may require several rounds if they are not all addressed the first time.\nUCLA Samueli School of Engineering Commencement Ceremony\nPh.D. students who would like to participate in the Samueli School of Engineering Commencement Ceremony must fill out the commencement survey in the Final Defense Checklist. Eligible participants include those graduating in the Fall, Winter, Spring, and upcoming Summer. For example, if you would like to participate in the June 2025 ceremony, you must have graduated during Fall 2024, Winter 2025, Spring 2025, or plan to graduate by the end of Summer 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoctoral Student Travel Grants\nRegistered CS PhD students are eligible to apply for doctoral travel grants. The purpose of the grant is to encourage eligible UCLA doctoral students to present their work and network at conference in their field, to support travel associated with off-campus research, and to enable students to take advantage of off-campus professional development opportunities.\nEach eligible new and continuing UCLA doctoral student will be provided up to $1,000 total reimbursement that can be used, in whole or in part, at any time throughout he student’s seventh year in the doctoral program, as long as the student and activities meet the eligibility requirements. Expenses may include airfare, transportation, lodging, meals, and conference/workshop registration and fees.\nFor eligibility requirements, deadlines, and procedures, visit the DGE website.\nFields of Study\nArtificial Intelligence\nComputational Systems Biology\nComputer Science Theory\nComputer System Architecture\nData Science Computing\nGraphics and Vision\nNetwork Systems\nSoftware Systems\nDegree Requirements\n\nNormally, Ph.D. students take courses to acquire the knowledge needed to prepare for the written and oral preliminary examinations and for conducting research. The basic program of study is built around the following:\n\nWritten Qualifying Examination (WQE) \nCOM SCI 201 Seminar Requirement (3 quarters)\nProposal of Fields (POF)\nAd-hoc Checklist (if applicable)\nOral Qualifying Examination (OQE) and Advancement to Candidacy (ATC)\nFinal Oral Examination on the Dissertation (Final Defense)\nFiling the Doctoral Dissertation\nAcademic Progress Requirements (Time-to-Degree)\n\n\n\n\n\nTo maintain satisfactory academic progress, Ph.D. students must reach the degree milestones by the following deadlines:\n\nWritten Qualifying Exam:  End of 2nd year (6th quarter)\nCOM SCI 201 Seminar Requirement:  End of 3rd year (9th quarter)\nProposal of Fields:  End of 3rd Year (9th quarter)\nOral Qualifying Exam:  End of 3rd year (9th quarter) Missing this OQE milestone by the 12th quarter will result in an Unsatisfactory outcome in the PhD progress report.\nFinal Defense:  End of 6th year (18th quarter)\n\nThe expected time to graduation of 6 years (18 quarters) accords with Graduate Division rules, which limit students to a maximum of 12 quarters as a teaching assistant and a maximum of 18 quarters combined as either a teaching assistant or research assistant.\nEach year at the end of spring quarter the entire faculty evaluates the academic progress of all Ph.D. students. A summary of each evaluation is sent by email to all students and their faculty advisors. These notifications indicate if the academic progress of students has been satisfactory or unsatisfactory.  By default the evaluations work as follows, but outcomes can differ based on the faculty discussion:\n\nA student who has completed all milestones that are required based on their length of time in the program receives an evaluation of “satisfactory progress.”\nA student who fails to meet one of the above deadlines for the first time receives an evaluation of “unsatisfactory progress.”\nThe student is typically given six months to complete the milestone and is re-evaluated at that point.\nA student who fails to meet the deadline required by a prior evaluation of “unsatisfactory progress” receives an evaluation of “unsatisfactory progress, subject to dismissal.”  The student is typically given six more months to complete the milestone and is notified that they are subject to dismissal from the Ph.D. program if this deadline is not met.\nA student who fails to meet the deadline required by a prior evaluation of “unsatisfactory progress, subject to dismissal” will be discussed by the faculty.  Based on input from the student’s faculty advisor and other information, the faculty may vote to dismiss the student from the Ph.D. program, or they may decide to give the student one more chance and send another “unsatisfactory progress, subject to dismissal” letter. An “unsatisfactory progress, subject to dismissal” evaluation may also affect a student’s eligibility for a TA assignment.\n\nStudents who fail to meet requirements may be recommended for termination of graduate study. Graduate students may be disqualified from continuing in the graduate program for a variety of reasons. The most common is failure to maintain the minimum cumulative grade point average (3.00) required by the Academic Senate to remain in good standing. Other examples include failure of examinations, lack of timely progress toward the degree, and poor performance in core courses. Probationary students (those with cumulative grade point averages below 3.00 or if the student’s work in any two consecutive terms fall below a 3.00) are subject to immediate dismissal upon the recommendation of their department. University guidelines governing the termination of graduate students, including the appeal procedure, are outlined in Standards and Procedures for Graduate Study at UCLA (found here).\nWritten Qualifying Exam (WQE)\n\nThe written qualifying examination (WQE) is the preliminary written examination for all Computer Science Ph.D. students in the Fall and Spring quarters only. The WQE consists of a high-quality paper, solely written by the student. The paper can be either a research paper containing an original contribution, or a focused critical survey paper. The paper should demonstrate the student’s understanding of the subject area, as well as their ability to integrate and communicate ideas clearly and concisely. To make satisfactory academic progress, students should take and pass the WQE no later than their 2nd year (6th quarter) of enrollment. Students must be enrolled during the quarter they take the WQE. Review the WQE requirements, submission procedures and deadlines.\nLENGTH: Maximum of 10 single-spaced pages.\nSTYLE: Suitable for submission to a first-rate technical conference or journal.\nCONTENT RESTRICTIONS: The paper must represent work that the student did as a graduate student at UCLA. Students must explicitly acknowledge in detail any contributions, including those of their faculty advisor, that are not their own. Any contributions to the paper that are not the student’s, including those of their advisor, must be explicitly acknowledged in detail. Specifically, on the first page of the WQE paper, in a separate paragraph at the end of the abstract, the student is required to specify, in detail, which parts of the paper represent the student’s own intellectual contributions. They also need to acknowledge that the paper is written entirely by the student. Any parts of the paper that are the contributions of others, including the advisor(s), must also be explicitly acknowledged in detail. There must be a separate sentence detailing the advisor’s contribution to the research and paper. In addition, there must be a different sentence describing the contributions of each co-author of the paper, if any.\nPREPARATION: An individual studies class, CS597B: Preparation for Ph.D. Preliminary Examination, is offered for variable units (2-12) and may be used to satisfy the minimum 12-unit course work requirement each quarter.\nSUBMISSION PROCESS: The paper must first be approved for submission by the student’s faculty advisor. Their signature on the WQE Cover Page is proof of approval. The WQE Cover Page then must be turned in to the Graduate Student Affairs Office at helen@cs.ucla.edu by the posted deadline. There are two deadlines a year for submission of papers, one in the fall quarter and the other in the spring quarter. Students are emailed a WQE announcement including dates and instructions after the start of the fall and the winter quarters.\nREVIEW PROCESS: After submission, the WQE will be reviewed by at least two other members of the faculty. Students will receive via email an evaluation and whether or not they have passed the WQE.\nNOTE: Ph.D. students who want to receive a master’s degree along the way may substitute a passing WQE for the master’s comprehensive examination.\nCOM SCI 201 Seminar Requirement\n\nPhD students must complete at least three quarters of Computer Science 201 with grades of Satisfactory (in addition to the three quarters of CS 201 that may have been completed for the M.S. degree).\nCompletion of the seminars will be reviewed when students submit the Proposal of Fields form.\nStudents who plan to add the CS MS degree along the way must complete six quarters of COM SCI 201 with an ‘S’ grade.\nProposal of Fields (POF)\n\n\nThe Proposal of Fields (POF) consists of one major field and two minor fields. The major field and at least one minor field must be in computer science. All major and minor field courses must be taken for a letter grade. To satisfy the major field requirement, students are expected to attain a body of knowledge contained in five courses, as well as the current literature in the area of specialization. In particular, students are required to take a minimum of three graduate courses in the major field of Ph.D. research, selecting these courses in accordance with guidelines specific to the major field. Grades of B-minus or better, with a grade-point average of at least 3.33 in all courses used to satisfy the major field requirement, are required. Students are required to satisfy the major field requirement by the end of their 3rd year (9th quarter) of enrollment and before taking the Oral Qualifying Examination (OQE). Each minor field normally embraces a body of knowledge equivalent to two courses, at least one of which is a graduate course. Grades of B-minus or better, with a grade-point average of at least 3.33 in all courses included in the minor field, are required. At least one minor field must be in computer science. Both minors must be completed prior to the OQE.\nSTANDARD PROPOSALS: Refer to the Proposal of Fields Guidelines for composing major and minor proposals in established fields. If the courses in a major or a minor field proposal adhere to these guidelines, the field will not require the signature of the corresponding field chair. The established fields are as follows: Artificial Intelligence, Computational Systems Biology, Computer System Architecture, Computer Science Theory, Data Science Computing, Graphics and Vision, Network Systems, and Software Systems.\nPROPOSALS WITH ONE OR MORE COURSE SUBSTITUTIONS: A major or a minor field proposal in an established field that deviates from the standard guidelines by one or more course substitutions must be approved by the corresponding field chair (who may consult with faculty in the field). The list of current Field Chairs is available on the last page of the Proposal of Fields Guidelines.\nTo submit a petition for a course not listed, send a separate email for each course requiring a petition to the field chair to review. Copy helen@cs.ucla.edu in each email. Include a brief justification for the substitution. Include the course syllabus and a transcript with the class marked or highlighted so the certifying instructor can quickly confirm.\nCOURSE WORK TAKEN AT OTHER INSTITUTIONS: No more than three equivalent or related graduate courses taken at other institutions may be applied to the major or minor field requirements, subject to the following:\n\nIf a course taken at another institution is included in a major or minor field proposal, and falls within an established field, the proposal will be considered a deviation from the standard guidelines and must be approved by the corresponding field chair.\nThe graduate course must be taken while a graduate student.\nThe graduate course cannot have been applied toward an undergraduate degree.\n\nAD-HOC PROPOSAL: A major or minor field proposal that does not fall in one of the established fields is considered an ad-hoc field proposal. Guidelines for consideration follow:\n\nThe department must approve all proposals for an ad-hoc field. Students are strongly encouraged to submit their ad-hoc proposal for approval BEFORE taking any of the proposed courses.\nThe ad-hoc field should be a coherent set of courses in an identifiable area (body of knowledge) that is not a subfield of the area of the major or the minors. The ad-hoc field should provide a perspective that is different from the other fields. It cannot merely be a collection of three useful classes.\nIf the ad-hoc field presents some overlap with topics that are generally associated with the other fields, the student must provide a justification that carefully explains why this overlap does not impinge on the value of the minor to broadening the academic experience. (If the Academic Policy Committee [APC] finds such an overlap, the students may be required to provide more information.)\nAd-hoc minor cannot include courses that are listed either as core or ancillary of other proposed major and minor. For example, a proposal with the DSC major cannot include any courses listed in the DSC core and ancillary lists in the ad-hoc minor.\n\nAD-HOC PROPOSAL SUBMISSION & APPROVAL PROCEDURES: The proposal for an ad-hoc field must be included in a completed Proposal of Fields and must be submitted together with a detailed, written justification explaining how the proposed ad-hoc field meets the requirements above and supports a research area. Include details on the proposed classes for the field (course description and/or course syllabus for each class). Email a scanned copy of the completed Proposal of Fields to Diana Valdes by Friday of Week 5. Refer to list of current Field Chairs. The subject line should read “Proposal for Ad-Hoc Field”. Approval of an ad-hoc field proposal requires a majority vote of the Academic Policy Committee (APC). The APC Chair, on behalf of the committee, will inform students and the CS Graduate Student Affairs Office by email when a decision is reached.\nThe POF form, guidelines, and procedures are available here: Proposal of Fields.\nAdding an MS Degree Along the Way\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCS Ph.D. students who have not earned previously a master’s in computer science, electrical engineering, or similar discipline AND have not advanced to candidacy for the PhD may be awarded an MS degree while working toward the PhD degree by fulfilling all the MS degree requirements. The MS degree and PhD degree may not be conferred in the same quarter, so the process should begin no later than the term in which the MS degree requirements are fulfilled. Students should confer with their faculty advisor about whether they should do a Thesis (Master’s Plan I) or a Capstone Plan (Master’s Plan II). A passed Written Qualifying Examination (WQE) may be substituted for the Capstone Project in Plan II.\nREQUIRED FORMS:\n\nComplete the Advancement to Candidacy Petition. Use instructions on page 1 of this form to fill out the ATC petition. Only the student signature is required. The Grad Office will approve and sign the ATC form.\nDownload a copy of your unofficial transcript and highlight the 9 courses used toward the MS Program of Study. Then merge the transcripts starting on page 2 of the ATC petition. #1 and #2 should be one, single PDF file. Rename this file to “MS, Yourlastname YourUID” (i.e. MS, Bruin 123456789).\nPhD adding MS Degree form (page 2) and Proposed MS Program Study (page 3). If you are taking the WQE in the same quarter you are adding the MS degree, enter the quarter you are taking the WQE. If CS 201 or any other courses are currently in progress in the quarter you are adding the MS degree, mark the grade as “TBD.” We will take care of the necessary signatures. Rename this file to “Your Name PhDAddingMS” (i.e. Joe Bruin PhDAddingMS).\nM.S. Capstone Project Results Form (if Plan II is chosen). If applicable, please note on this form that If the WQE is being substituted for the Capstone Project. Committee signatures should be left blank since you are PhD student using the WQE instead. Rename this file to “Your Name MS Capstone Form” (i.e. Joe Bruin Capstone Form).\n\n\n\nDEADLINE:Submit all materials to jalvarez@cs.ucla.eduno later than Friday of Week 2 of the quarter in which the MS degree is to be awarded. If all documents and the thesis or comprehensive examination are submitted according to deadlines, the “degree awarded” date will be the graduation date of that term.\nFAQ:\n\nDo I need to pass the WQE before adding the MS degree? No, you may take the WQE in the same quarter you want to add the MS degree. Awarding of the MS degree will be contingent upon you passing the WQE. Students may indicate on the required MS forms above that the WQE is currently in progress.\nDo I need to finish 9 courses and six CS 201s a quarter before adding the MS degree? No, you may take your remaining courses in-progress and add the MS degree in the same quarter. Students must show they are enrolled in the last course(s) needed to complete the MS program of study. Awarding of the MS degree will be contingent upon you passing the final course(s). Students may indicate on the required MS forms above which course(s) are currently in progress.\nAre the course requirements the same for the CS MS and PhD degrees? While both degrees require 9 courses and the 9 courses may (often do) overlap, students should ensure they are satisfying both requirements separately. The MS degree requires a certain number of 200-level CS courses and electives within CS or Engineering. While the Proposal of Fields may allow graduate course substitutions from other universities or other departments, the MS degree does not. Therefore, students are encouraged to review both sets of requirements to ensure their course selections satisfy both degrees. The MS degree requires students to take their 9 courses as a graduate student at UCLA.\nI don’t plan to advance to candidacy (ATC) or do my Oral Qualifying Exam (OQE) yet. When should I add the MS degree? The master’s ATC and the doctoral ATC are two separate procedures. The master’s ATC (if students wish to add the MS degree) must occur before the doctoral ATC. To ATC for the master’s degree, PhD students typically take six CS 201s, complete the MS program of study, and the WQE. Students should add the MS degree in the quarter they are taking their last MS course requirement(s) and/or WQE. To ATC for the doctoral degree, PhD students must finish their Proposal of Fields and pass the Oral Qualifying Exam.\nMay I add the MS degree and do my OQE in the same quarter? Yes, as long as 1) the required forms for the master’s ATC are submitted by Friday of Week 2 and 2) you have completed the PhD Proposal of Fields, you may add the MS degree and do the OQE in the same quarter if necessary. The university policy is that the MS ATC must occur the PhD ATC. The official MS ATC confirmation email is typically sent to students during the middle of the quarter. Thus, students who wish to do the OQE in the same quarter are encouraged to schedule the OQE in the second half of the quarter so that the PhD ATC occurs after.\nOral Qualifying Exam (OQE) & Advancement To Candidacy (ATC)\n\n\n\nOQE MILESTONE: After passing the WQE, students should form a doctoral committee and prepare to take the Oral Qualifying Examination (OQE). To make satisfactory academic progress, students should take and pass the OQE no later than the end of their 3rd year (9th quarter) of enrollment. The nature and content of the OQE are at the discretion of the doctoral committee, but generally the student gives a talk, followed by questions from the faculty.\nENROLLMENT REQUIREMENT: Students must be enrolled during the quarter they take the OQE. If students take the OQE in the summer, they must have been enrolled in at least 12 units in the preceding Spring quarter.\nADDING AN MS DEGREE ALONG THE WAY: PhD students who have not previously earned a master’s degree may add the MS degree in CS along the way. Students must submit a petition to add the MS degree before the OQE can be held. The MS degree cannot be added after the OQE. Additional instructions can be found in the “Adding an MS Degree Along the Way” section above.\nNOMINATING A DOCTORAL COMMITTEE: The Division of Graduate Education must approve the doctoral committee before the OQE can be held.\nHOW TO PREPARE: Students should familiarize themselves with the regulations for the doctoral qualifying examinations detailed in the Standards & Procedures for Graduate Study at UCLA (pages 15-18).\nORAL QUALIFYING EXAM – CHECKLIST REQUIREMENTS (DUE BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE CAN GO FORWARD)\n\n3 quarters of COM SCI 201 Seminars with ‘S’ grades only.

Once the report is processed, you will be charged fees that total $90 (for your Candidacy for Doctoral Degree). We suggest you check your BruinBill 10-15 days after you complete your Quals.\nDue to various University Policies, failure to complete these steps without their allotted lead time (6 weeks, 4 weeks, and 2 weeks prior to your scheduled exam) may result in requiring you to reschedule your exam.\nAn individual studies class, CS597C: Preparation for Ph.D. Oral Qualifying Examination, is offered for variable units (2-12) and may be used to satisfy the minimum 12-unit requirement each quarter.\nNRST WAIVER: Beginning the quarter immediately after the OQE is passed, non-resident supplemental tuition (NRST) is waived for up to nine quarters. If nine quarters pass without the filing of the dissertation, non-resident tuition charges are reinstituted.\nDoctoral Dissertation and Filing Fee\n\n\n\n\nAfter successfully completing the final defense, students are expected to soon be ready to file their dissertation. Students must follow the official UCLA manuscript preparation guide for Thesis and Dissertation Filing Requirements.  All Ph.D. students expecting to graduate in a given quarter are strongly encouraged to attend a dissertation filing workshop scheduled at the beginning of each quarter at the Charles E. Young Research Library.\nDOCTORAL FILING FEE: In the term that students intend to file their dissertation, they may apply for Filing Fee instead of enrolling for courses on the condition that they are completing only their dissertation. Filing fee status may be applied only for one quarter. If students on Filing Fee fail to complete their dissertation by the filing deadline, they must retroactively enroll and pay fees for that quarter. Information and instruction for completing the doctoral Filing Fee application and the Filing Fee application are available here. In approximately 10 business days, students should review their Bruin Bill account for a posting of a charge of $201 for the doctoral Filing Fee. Approximately 5 business days after fee payment, the filing date is posted on the transcript. If filed by the term’s dissertation deadline, the “degree awarded” date will be the graduation date of that term.\nDeadlines are posted in the Resources for Students page.\nFinal Defense Checklist\n (OPTIONAL) RECONSTITUTE your doctoral committee (6 WEEKS BEFORE EXAM)\n\nIf you need to add or change a committee member: Complete the RECONSTITUTION OF COMMITTEE FORM.

The purpose of the grant is to encourage eligible UCLA doctoral students to present their work and network at conference in their field, to support travel associated with off-campus research, and to enable students to take advantage of off-campus professional development opportunities.\nEach eligible new and continuing UCLA doctoral student will be provided up to $1,000 total reimbursement that can be used, in whole or in part, at any time throughout he student’s seventh year in the doctoral program, as long as the student and activities meet the eligibility requirements. Expenses may include airfare, transportation, lodging, meals, and conference/workshop registration and fees.\nFor eligibility requirements, deadlines, and procedures, visit the DGE website.\nGeneral Information for All CS Graduate Students\n\nBruin Bill\nAll students are assigned a Bruin Bill account. Your Bruin Bill account records all charges and payments (including housing) associated with registration along with other service charges that are assessed to students. You can access your Bruin Bill through MyUCLA.\nStudents are not notified when charges are posted. Accordingly, students should check their Bruin Bill account regularly. Miscellaneous fees accrue throughout the quarter and are due by the 20th of each month. If unpaid, a late fee will be applied to their Bruin Bill each month.\n\nBruin Alert\n\nBruinAlert was developed to communicate official information during an emergency or crisis that disrupts normal operation of the UCLA campus, or threatens the health and safety of members of the campus community. Students with current email addresses in MyUCLA are automatically enrolled in BruinAlert.\n\n\nCS Email Account \n\n\nBruin OnLine (BOL)\nBruin OnLine (BOL) is a collection of services that provides UCLA students, faculty, and staff with:\nEmail\nNetwork Connectivity, including Wireless\nFree Software and Support\nIn order to have access to BOL services, students must have a UCLA Logon ID. Students can create their UCLA Logon ID at: http://accounts.iam.ucla.edu/\nIn addition to establishing a BOL account, students must set up a CS Account, which serves as the official communication link between students and the CS department.\nCS Account\nFaculty and staff primarily communicate with students through email. The CS account serves as the official communication link between CS students and the department. Accordingly, it is important that students check their email regularly for important deadlines, notices, and announcements. Not all messages may apply to everyone so it is important to pay attention to the subject line. To apply for a departmental computer account, students should read the CS Computer Account Policy and consult the Graduate Advisor for the account signup link. Faculty, staff, and others should consult the CS human resources manager.\nStudents can only have an active CS email account once they are registered, enrolled and have started the CS Grad Program. Students with a CS email account may subscribe to the CS jobs listserv by visiting: www.cs.ucla.edu/mailman/listinfo/jobs\nSEASnet Computer Systems User Account\n• Register online at: http://www.seas.ucla.edu/acctapp\n• Allow one day for processing, then visit the SEASnet Lab at 2684 Boelter Hall to complete registration\n• See website for eligibility information at: SEASnet Accounts\n\n\n\nDepartment Keys\n\n\nA swipe card is required to access the Graduate Student Workstation, Graduate Lounge, Graduate Student Offices, and department labs. To obtain a department swipe card, see Mildri Lopez-Duarte in EVI 277M. Students are required to make a $20 deposit for the key, fully refundable when leaving the department.\n\n\n\nEnrollment And Courses\nAs noted in the Standards and Procedures for Graduate Study at UCLA (available here), unless granted a formal leave of absence, graduate students are expected to register every term, including the term in which their degree is to be awarded. A student must be registered in order to take any University examination with the exception of those that are permitted by payment of the Filing Fee (master’s comprehensive exam or doctoral final defense.) Students must be registered during the regular academic quarter when they take the written and oral qualifying examinations for the doctorate. To be eligible to take such examinations in the summer, the student must have been registered in the immediately preceding Spring term.\nIt is the student’s responsibility to check when their enrollment appointments are on their MyUCLA.\nFor the first pass of enrollment, CS students can only enroll in 8 units. After the 2nd pass, students should be able to enroll up to 18 units max.\nThree regular courses (or 12 units) per term are considered the normal enrollment for graduate students. All computer science graduate students must be enrolled in at least 12 units each regular quarter (Fall, Winter, and Spring) to maintain full-time student status. Students are responsible for checking their study list on MyUCLA prior to the third week of classes to ensure that they have enrolled in the sufficient number of units. CS students are subject to dismissal from the program if not enrolled full-time, on leave of absence, or on Filing Fee status.\nEnrollment appointments are published on the Registrar’s Office webpage at: http://www.registrar.ucla.edu/soc/enrollappt.htm\nThe process for being enrolled into upper-division undergrad courses (100-level courses) will be sent out by the CS Grad Office mid quarter.\nIndividual Studies Classes are offered for variable units and may be used to satisfy the minimum 12-unit course work requirement each quarter. Enrollment must be pre-approved by students’ faculty advisors.\nAdditional University and Graduate Program Deadlines can be found at the Resources for Students page.\n\nEnrollment Verification\n\nTo request a letter to verify student status, please email the Graduate Student Affairs Office 2 business days in advance with the information below. Students will be notified when the verification letter is ready:\n\nStudent’s name\nStudent’s ID number\nPurpose of the letter\nTo whom the letter should be addressed\nExpected degree date\nOther relevant information\n\n\n\nFaculty Advisors\n\n\nFaculty advisors assist students with planning their course of study and answering questions concerning courses, course materials, and research in their area of interest. It is important that students meet with their faculty advisors regularly throughout their graduate studies at UCLA.\nPH.D. STUDENTS: Ph. D. students are assigned advisors upon admission to the Computer Science Department.\nM.S. STUDENTS: M.S. students are assigned an initial faculty advisor (an email will be sent to them directly with their initial  faculty advisor info after Orientation), but are expected to find a permanent faculty advisor by end of the second quarter, and no later than the third quarter. Once M.S. students have selected a permanent faculty advisor, they must complete the Advisor Consent Form  (for M.S. students).

It is the responsibility of graduate students to ensure that those additional fees (non-remissible fees), are paid by the applicable Graduate Program Deadlines (listed at the Resources for Students page).\nInternational Students\n\nEnglish as a Second Language Placement Exam (ESLPE)\nInternational graduate students need to take the ESLPE if their native language is not English, their TOEFL-IBT score is under 100 (or their IELTS score is below 7.5), and their application shows that they do not have a previous degree from a university where English is the medium of instruction and in an English-speaking country.\nStudents should take the ESLPE before the 1st quarter (summer). If students cannot take the exam in the summer, they may take the exam during the Fall in Week 2. The ESLPE test dates can be found on the ESLPE website. The exam will be offered up to 4 times in summer and in Week 2 of Fall quarter. There will be no exams offered in Winter or Spring.\nFailure to take the ESLPE in the first quarter will result in a hold on your MyUCLA records.\n\nTest of Oral Proficiency (TOP)\nAll graduate students at UCLA who are i) non-US citizens, ii) do not hold a bachelor’s degree from an institution where English was the medium of communication, and iii) wish to be TA’s, must first take the TEST OF ORAL PROFICIENCY (TOP) and earn a provisional passing score (6.4 – 7.0) to become eligible to be a TA. The Computer Science Department has a higher standard, requiring students to earn a clear passing score of 7.1 or higher. Passing the TOP must occur at least two quarters prior to the quarter that you would like to TA. Example: if you want to TA spring quarter you will need to pass the TOP by the end of fall quarter. As such, we recommend students take the TOP as soon as possible once they enter UCLA.\nNon-Passing (0.0 – 6.3):  Student is not permitted to TA and must take an approved ESL course for international TAs (310, 311, 312, or 313) before retaking the exam. The student may retake the exam while enrolled in the course.\nProvisional Pass (6.4 – 7.0):  Student is required to take a full 10-week approved ESL course for international TAs (ESL 310, 311, 312 or 313) before the first quarter of TA work. If the student successfully completes the ESL course with a passing grade, the student may serve as a TA without further testing or coursework. If the student does not pass the required ESL course, the student must take a second approved ESL course in a subsequent quarter and receive a passing grade in order to serve as TA.

If PhD students need to a verification of degree completion, please contact Helen Tran at helen@cs.ucla.edu.\nEnglish as a Second Language Placement Exam (ESLPE)\nInternational graduate students need to take the ESLPE if their native language is not English, their TOEFL-IBT score is under 100 (or their IELTS score is below 7.5), and their application shows that they do not have a previous degree from a university where English is the medium of instruction and in an English-speaking country.\nStudents should take the ESLPE before the 1st quarter (summer). If students cannot take the exam in the summer, they may take the exam during the Fall in Week 2. The ESLPE test dates can be found on the ESLPE website. The exam will be offered up to 4 times in summer and in Week 2 of Fall quarter. There will be no exams offered in Winter or Spring.\nFailure to take the ESLPE in the first quarter will result in a hold on your MyUCLA records.\nTest of Oral Proficiency (TOP)\nAll graduate students at UCLA who are i) non-US citizens, ii) do not hold a bachelor’s degree from an institution where English was the medium of communication, and iii) wish to be TA’s, must first take the TEST OF ORAL PROFICIENCY (TOP) and earn a provisional passing score (6.4 – 7.0) to become eligible to be a TA. The Computer Science Department has a higher standard, requiring students to earn a clear passing score of 7.1 or higher. Passing the TOP must occur at least two quarters prior to the quarter that you would like to TA. Example: if you want to TA spring quarter you will need to pass the TOP by the end of fall quarter. As such, we recommend students take the TOP as soon as possible once they enter UCLA.\nNon-Passing (0.0 – 6.3):  Student is not permitted to TA and must take an approved ESL course for international TAs (310, 311, 312, or 313) before retaking the exam. The student may retake the exam while enrolled in the course.\nProvisional Pass (6.4 – 7.0):  Student is required to take a full 10-week approved ESL course for international TAs (ESL 310, 311, 312 or 313) before the first quarter of TA work. If the student successfully completes the ESL course with a passing grade, the student may serve as a TA without further testing or coursework. If the student does not pass the required ESL course, the student must take a second approved ESL course in a subsequent quarter and receive a passing grade in order to serve as TA. NOTE: If a student has fully or partially completed an approved course prior to receiving a marginal pass, this course is considered preparatory and does not satisfy the TOP requirement for a marginal pass. The TA must take another approved ESL course first.\nCS students who receive a Provisional Pass must enroll in an ESL oral skills course and then retake the exam with a 7.1 score or higher in order to be offered a CS TA position.\n\nClear Pass (7.1 – 10): The student is permitted to TA with no restrictions.

Each quarter, the HSSEAS Dean’s Office evaluates the academic progress of all M.S. students. The majority of students are making satisfactory academic progress. Students not making satisfactory academic progress are notified and given corrective steps and time frames which will enable them to attain satisfactory academic progress.\nMS students must be enrolled in a minimum of 12 units. If you have further questions regarding this, please contact Juliana Alvarez at jalvarez@cs.ucla.edu\nStudents who fail to meet requirements may be recommended for termination of graduate study. Graduate students may be disqualified from continuing in the graduate program for a variety of reasons. The most common is failure to maintain the minimum cumulative grade point average (3.00) required by the Academic Senate to remain in good standing. Other examples include failure of examinations, lack of timely progress toward the degree, and poor performance in core courses. Probationary students (those with cumulative grade point averages below 3.00) are subject to immediate dismissal upon the recommendation of their department. University guidelines governing the termination of graduate students, including the appeal procedure, are outlined in Standards and Procedures for Graduate Study at UCLA (found here). In addition to the standard reasons noted above, M.S. students may be recommended for termination for the following:\n\nFailure to maintain satisfactory progress toward the degree within the two-year time limit for completing all degree requirements.\nFailure to maintain a grade point average of 3.0 in all courses and in those in the 200 series.\nFailure to maintain a grade point average of 3.0 in any two consecutive terms.\nFailure of the comprehensive examination.\nFailure to complete the thesis to the satisfaction of the committee members.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM.S. Students Applying To Ph.D. Program\n\n\n\n\n\nThe selection of M.S. students who apply for admission into the Ph.D. program is a rigorous, internal process that identifies candidates who have demonstrated academic and research potential and achievement. The following application materials must be submitted to the CS Graduate Student Affairs Office (jalvarez@cs.ucla.edu) during the last term of full-time enrollment.\nStatement of purpose: Due no later than Week 2 of the last term of full-time enrollment.\nApplication for Admission to Ph.D. Program: Due no later than Week 2 of the last term of full-time enrollment.\nLetter of Recommendation: Statement from faculty advisor recommending admission and guaranteeing funding support for duration of graduate study and research. Due no later than Week 7 of the last term of full-time enrollment. Without the CS Faculty Advisor putting this in writing and giving it to the CS Student Grad Office, the student is unable to transition into the Ph.D. program.\nLetter of Recommendation Forms from faculty advisor and two other CS faculty. All must have evaluated either the student’s Capstone Project or Thesis. Due no later than Week 7 of the last term of full-time enrollment. The deadline for filing the M.S. thesis with the Young Research Library is Week 7 of the quarter. The deadline for filing the Capstone Project results with the CS Graduate Student Affair Office is also Week 7 of the quarter, which is 3 weeks earlier than the regular due date, to accommodate the processing and review of the application to the Ph.D. program. If all documents are submitted on or before the deadlines noted above and admission is offered, the effective term for classification as a Ph.D. student would be the term following the completion of all requirements for the M.S. degree, which includes submission of the M.S. thesis or Capstone Project.\nNOTE:\n\nFailure to submit each document by the deadline will cancel consideration of the internal M.S. to Ph.D. application. Students would then need to apply through the regular graduate application.\nStudents on filing fee during their last quarter may not apply using the above process. Students would instead need to reapply through the regular graduate application for admission. Please notify the Graduate Student Affairs Office when your application is submitted.\nFields of Study\nOnly formally admitted M.S. students who applied for the M.S. program during admissions are allowed to obtain a degree in the CS M.S. program.\nMS students are not required to select a major field.

You cannot drop this course at anytime.\nGSAO staff will verify course completion and grades at the end of the quarter. M.S. candidates have one calendar year from the date of advancement to candidacy in which to complete all requirements for the degree. If additional time is required, the student is responsible to resubmit their ATC packet by the deadline. Sample for the Advancement to Candidacy form can be found on the CS Grad Notices MS section.\nFor those finishing in Summer, in order to submit your capstone results form with all the signatures and abstract or uploading your thesis, you must be registered and enrolled for a minimum of 4 units or on filing fee.\nMaster’s Filing Fee\nWhen students have completed all requirements for the M.S. degree (except the filing of either the Thesis or Capstone Project) and have Advanced to Candidacy, they are eligible to pay a Filing Fee during the quarter in which the degree is to be awarded instead of registering. Filing Fee is entirely optional. You must be registered and enrolled the quarter you plan to submit your Advancement to Candidacy (ATC) packet (hence most students submit the ATC packet the quarter prior to the one they plan to be on Filing fee). You cannot ATC nor take classes the same quarter you plan to be on filing fee.\nStudents who plan to go on filing fee must have already have secured their advisor + committee members and have already begun worked on their capstone/thesis project the quarter prior to going on filing fee.\nStudents may only use Filing Fee for one quarter. Many services are suspended while on Filing Fee including but not limited to access to the UCLA VPN and online services among other services. Please visit the Filing Fee website for more information. Therefore if you need access to University resources, students should register and enroll and not apply for Filing Fee. If you are on Filing Fee and will not finish that same quarter you are on Filing Fee, please contact Juliana Alvarez at jalvarez@cs.ucla.edu before week 10 of the quarter you are on Filing Fee.  If students on Filing Fee fail to complete their thesis or Capstone Project by Friday at the end of finals week (this includes procuring your advisor and committee signatures), they will need to apply for readmission into the CS MS program (no exceptions) and note readmission is not guaranteed.\nThe Master’s Filing Fee application (and deadline to submit the Filing Fee application) can be found on HERE. For Summer and Fall, the deadline is 10 business days prior to the last day of Summer Session C (except if the deadline falls on Labor Day; in these cases the deadline will be 9 business days). Information and instructions for completing the Master’s Filing Fee application for the current quarter are available at https://www.cs.ucla.edu/graduate-office-newsletter/\nM.S. Progress Requirements (Time To Degree)\n\n\n\n\n\nFriendly reminder: only formally admitted M.S. students who applied for the M.S. program during admissions are allowed to obtain a degree in the CS M.S. program.\nTo maintain satisfactory academic progress, M.S. students must reach the milestones as established in the degree requirements outlined above, namely:\n\nProgram of Study: Should finish half if not more by the end of their first year in the MS program\nPetition for ATC: 2nd week of the quarter the comprehensive examination or thesis is being submitted\n\nThe maximum time to satisfactorily complete all M.S. requirements is 2 years or 6 quarters. Each quarter, the HSSEAS Dean’s Office evaluates the academic progress of all M.S. students. The majority of students are making satisfactory academic progress. Students not making satisfactory academic progress are notified and given corrective steps and time frames which will enable them to attain satisfactory academic progress.\nMS students must be enrolled in a minimum of 12 units. If you have further questions regarding this, please contact Juliana Alvarez at jalvarez@cs.ucla.edu\nStudents who fail to meet requirements may be recommended for termination of graduate study. Graduate students may be disqualified from continuing in the graduate program for a variety of reasons. The most common is failure to maintain the minimum cumulative grade point average (3.00) required by the Academic Senate to remain in good standing. Other examples include failure of examinations, lack of timely progress toward the degree, and poor performance in core courses. Probationary students (those with cumulative grade point averages below 3.00) are subject to immediate dismissal upon the recommendation of their department. University guidelines governing the termination of graduate students, including the appeal procedure, are outlined in Standards and Procedures for Graduate Study at UCLA (found here). In addition to the standard reasons noted above, M.S. students may be recommended for termination for the following:\n\nFailure to maintain satisfactory progress toward the degree within the two-year time limit for completing all degree requirements.\nFailure to maintain a grade point average of 3.0 in all courses and in those in the 200 series.\nFailure to maintain a grade point average of 3.0 in any two consecutive terms.\nFailure of the comprehensive examination.\nFailure to complete the thesis to the satisfaction of the committee members.\nM.S. Students Applying To Ph.D. Program\n\n\n\n\n\nThe selection of M.S. students who apply for admission into the Ph.D. program is a rigorous, internal process that identifies candidates who have demonstrated academic and research potential and achievement. The following application materials must be submitted to the CS Graduate Student Affairs Office (jalvarez@cs.ucla.edu) during the last term of full-time enrollment.\nStatement of purpose: Due no later than Week 2 of the last term of full-time enrollment.\nApplication for Admission to Ph.D. Program: Due no later than Week 2 of the last term of full-time enrollment.\nLetter of Recommendation: Statement from faculty advisor recommending admission and guaranteeing funding support for duration of graduate study and research. Due no later than Week 7 of the last term of full-time enrollment. Without the CS Faculty Advisor putting this in writing and giving it to the CS Student Grad Office, the student is unable to transition into the Ph.D. program.\nLetter of Recommendation Forms from faculty advisor and two other CS faculty. All must have evaluated either the student’s Capstone Project or Thesis. Due no later than Week 7 of the last term of full-time enrollment. The deadline for filing the M.S. thesis with the Young Research Library is Week 7 of the quarter. The deadline for filing the Capstone Project results with the CS Graduate Student Affair Office is also Week 7 of the quarter, which is 3 weeks earlier than the regular due date, to accommodate the processing and review of the application to the Ph.D. program. If all documents are submitted on or before the deadlines noted above and admission is offered, the effective term for classification as a Ph.D. student would be the term following the completion of all requirements for the M.S. degree, which includes submission of the M.S. thesis or Capstone Project.\nNOTE:\n\nFailure to submit each document by the deadline will cancel consideration of the internal M.S. to Ph.D. application. Students would then need to apply through the regular graduate application.\nStudents on filing fee during their last quarter may not apply using the above process. Students would instead need to reapply through the regular graduate application for admission. Please notify the Graduate Student Affairs Office when your application is submitted.\n[GRID_TABLE]\nFields of Study\nOnly formally admitted M.S. students who applied for the M.S. program during admissions are allowed to obtain a degree in the CS M.S. program.\nMS students are not required to select a major field.

You cannot drop this course at anytime.\nGSAO staff will verify course completion and grades at the end of the quarter. M.S. candidates have one calendar year from the date of advancement to candidacy in which to complete all requirements for the degree. If additional time is required, the student is responsible to resubmit their ATC packet by the deadline. Sample for the Advancement to Candidacy form can be found on the CS Grad Notices MS section.\nFor those finishing in Summer, in order to submit your capstone results form with all the signatures and abstract or uploading your thesis, you must be registered and enrolled for a minimum of 4 units or on filing fee.\nMaster’s Filing Fee\nWhen students have completed all requirements for the M.S. degree (except the filing of either the Thesis or Capstone Project) and have Advanced to Candidacy, they are eligible to pay a Filing Fee during the quarter in which the degree is to be awarded instead of registering. Filing Fee is entirely optional. You must be registered and enrolled the quarter you plan to submit your Advancement to Candidacy (ATC) packet (hence most students submit the ATC packet the quarter prior to the one they plan to be on Filing fee). You cannot ATC nor take classes the same quarter you plan to be on filing fee.\nStudents who plan to go on filing fee must have already have secured their advisor + committee members and have already begun worked on their capstone/thesis project the quarter prior to going on filing fee.\nStudents may only use Filing Fee for one quarter. Many services are suspended while on Filing Fee including but not limited to access to the UCLA VPN and online services among other services. Please visit the Filing Fee website for more information. Therefore if you need access to University resources, students should register and enroll and not apply for Filing Fee. If you are on Filing Fee and will not finish that same quarter you are on Filing Fee, please contact Juliana Alvarez at jalvarez@cs.ucla.edu before week 10 of the quarter you are on Filing Fee.  If students on Filing Fee fail to complete their thesis or Capstone Project by Friday at the end of finals week (this includes procuring your advisor and committee signatures), they will need to apply for readmission into the CS MS program (no exceptions) and note readmission is not guaranteed.\nThe Master’s Filing Fee application (and deadline to submit the Filing Fee application) can be found on HERE. For Summer and Fall, the deadline is 10 business days prior to the last day of Summer Session C (except if the deadline falls on Labor Day; in these cases the deadline will be 9 business days). Information and instructions for completing the Master’s Filing Fee application for the current quarter are available at https://www.cs.ucla.edu/graduate-office-newsletter/\nM.S. Progress Requirements (Time To Degree)\n\n\n\n\n\nFriendly reminder: only formally admitted M.S. students who applied for the M.S. program during admissions are allowed to obtain a degree in the CS M.S. program.\nTo maintain satisfactory academic progress, M.S. students must reach the milestones as established in the degree requirements outlined above, namely:\n\nProgram of Study: Should finish half if not more by the end of their first year in the MS program\nPetition for ATC: 2nd week of the quarter the comprehensive examination or thesis is being submitted\n\nThe maximum time to satisfactorily complete all M.S. requirements is 2 years or 6 quarters. Each quarter, the HSSEAS Dean’s Office evaluates the academic progress of all M.S. students. The majority of students are making satisfactory academic progress. Students not making satisfactory academic progress are notified and given corrective steps and time frames which will enable them to attain satisfactory academic progress.\nMS students must be enrolled in a minimum of 12 units. If you have further questions regarding this, please contact Juliana Alvarez at jalvarez@cs.ucla.edu\nStudents who fail to meet requirements may be recommended for termination of graduate study. Graduate students may be disqualified from continuing in the graduate program for a variety of reasons. The most common is failure to maintain the minimum cumulative grade point average (3.00) required by the Academic Senate to remain in good standing. Other examples include failure of examinations, lack of timely progress toward the degree, and poor performance in core courses. Probationary students (those with cumulative grade point averages below 3.00) are subject to immediate dismissal upon the recommendation of their department. University guidelines governing the termination of graduate students, including the appeal procedure, are outlined in Standards and Procedures for Graduate Study at UCLA (found here). In addition to the standard reasons noted above, M.S. students may be recommended for termination for the following:\n\nFailure to maintain satisfactory progress toward the degree within the two-year time limit for completing all degree requirements.\nFailure to maintain a grade point average of 3.0 in all courses and in those in the 200 series.\nFailure to maintain a grade point average of 3.0 in any two consecutive terms.\nFailure of the comprehensive examination.\nFailure to complete the thesis to the satisfaction of the committee members.\nM.S. Students Applying To Ph.D. Program\n\n\n\n\n\nThe selection of M.S. students who apply for admission into the Ph.D. program is a rigorous, internal process that identifies candidates who have demonstrated academic and research potential and achievement. The following application materials must be submitted to the CS Graduate Student Affairs Office (jalvarez@cs.ucla.edu) during the last term of full-time enrollment.\nStatement of purpose: Due no later than Week 2 of the last term of full-time enrollment.\nApplication for Admission to Ph.D. Program: Due no later than Week 2 of the last term of full-time enrollment.\nLetter of Recommendation: Statement from faculty advisor recommending admission and guaranteeing funding support for duration of graduate study and research. Due no later than Week 7 of the last term of full-time enrollment. Without the CS Faculty Advisor putting this in writing and giving it to the CS Student Grad Office, the student is unable to transition into the Ph.D. program.\nLetter of Recommendation Forms from faculty advisor and two other CS faculty. All must have evaluated either the student’s Capstone Project or Thesis. Due no later than Week 7 of the last term of full-time enrollment. The deadline for filing the M.S. thesis with the Young Research Library is Week 7 of the quarter. The deadline for filing the Capstone Project results with the CS Graduate Student Affair Office is also Week 7 of the quarter, which is 3 weeks earlier than the regular due date, to accommodate the processing and review of the application to the Ph.D. program. If all documents are submitted on or before the deadlines noted above and admission is offered, the effective term for classification as a Ph.D. student would be the term following the completion of all requirements for the M.S. degree, which includes submission of the M.S. thesis or Capstone Project.\nNOTE:\n\nFailure to submit each document by the deadline will cancel consideration of the internal M.S. to Ph.D. application. Students would then need to apply through the regular graduate application.\nStudents on filing fee during their last quarter may not apply using the above process. Students would instead need to reapply through the regular graduate application for admission. Please notify the Graduate Student Affairs Office when your application is submitted.\n[GRID_TABLE]\nDoctoral Program\n\nFields of Study\nArtificial Intelligence\nComputational Systems Biology\nComputer Science Theory\nComputer System Architecture\nData Science Computing\nGraphics and Vision\nNetwork Systems\nSoftware Systems\n\nDegree Requirements\n\nNormally, Ph.D. students take courses to acquire the knowledge needed to prepare for the written and oral preliminary examinations and for conducting research. The basic program of study is built around the following:\n\nWritten Qualifying Examination (WQE) \nCOM SCI 201 Seminar Requirement (3 quarters)\nProposal of Fields (POF)\nAd-hoc Checklist (if applicable)\nOral Qualifying Examination (OQE) and Advancement to Candidacy (ATC)\nFinal Oral Examination on the Dissertation (Final Defense)\nFiling the Doctoral Dissertation\n\n\n\nAcademic Progress Requirements (Time-to-Degree)\n\n\n\n\n\nTo maintain satisfactory academic progress, Ph.D. students must reach the degree milestones by the following deadlines:\n\nWritten Qualifying Exam:  End of 2nd year (6th quarter)\nCOM SCI 201 Seminar Requirement:  End of 3rd year (9th quarter)\nProposal of Fields:  End of 3rd Year (9th quarter)\nOral Qualifying Exam:  End of 3rd year (9th quarter) Missing this OQE milestone by the 12th quarter will result in an Unsatisfactory outcome in the PhD progress report.\nFinal Defense:  End of 6th year (18th quarter)\n\nThe expected time to graduation of 6 years (18 quarters) accords with Graduate Division rules, which limit students to a maximum of 12 quarters as a teaching assistant and a maximum of 18 quarters combined as either a teaching assistant or research assistant.\nEach year at the end of spring quarter the entire faculty evaluates the academic progress of all Ph.D. students. A summary of each evaluation is sent by email to all students and their faculty advisors. These notifications indicate if the academic progress of students has been satisfactory or unsatisfactory.  By default the evaluations work as follows, but outcomes can differ based on the faculty discussion:\n\nA student who has completed all milestones that are required based on their length of time in the program receives an evaluation of “satisfactory progress.”\nA student who fails to meet one of the above deadlines for the first time receives an evaluation of “unsatisfactory progress.”\nThe student is typically given six months to complete the milestone and is re-evaluated at that point.\nA student who fails to meet the deadline required by a prior evaluation of “unsatisfactory progress” receives an evaluation of “unsatisfactory progress, subject to dismissal.”  The student is typically given six more months to complete the milestone and is notified that they are subject to dismissal from the Ph.D. program if this deadline is not met.\nA student who fails to meet the deadline required by a prior evaluation of “unsatisfactory progress, subject to dismissal” will be discussed by the faculty.  Based on input from the student’s faculty advisor and other information, the faculty may vote to dismiss the student from the Ph.D. program, or they may decide to give the student one more chance and send another “unsatisfactory progress, subject to dismissal” letter. An “unsatisfactory progress, subject to dismissal” evaluation may also affect a student’s eligibility for a TA assignment.\n\nStudents who fail to meet requirements may be recommended for termination of graduate study. Graduate students may be disqualified from continuing in the graduate program for a variety of reasons. The most common is failure to maintain the minimum cumulative grade point average (3.00) required by the Academic Senate to remain in good standing. Other examples include failure of examinations, lack of timely progress toward the degree, and poor performance in core courses. Probationary students (those with cumulative grade point averages below 3.00 or if the student’s work in any two consecutive terms fall below a 3.00) are subject to immediate dismissal upon the recommendation of their department. University guidelines governing the termination of graduate students, including the appeal procedure, are outlined in Standards and Procedures for Graduate Study at UCLA (found here).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWritten Qualifying Exam (WQE)\n\nThe written qualifying examination (WQE) is the preliminary written examination for all Computer Science Ph.D. students in the Fall and Spring quarters only. The WQE consists of a high-quality paper, solely written by the student. The paper can be either a research paper containing an original contribution, or a focused critical survey paper. The paper should demonstrate the student’s understanding of the subject area, as well as their ability to integrate and communicate ideas clearly and concisely. To make satisfactory academic progress, students should take and pass the WQE no later than their 2nd year (6th quarter) of enrollment. Students must be enrolled during the quarter they take the WQE. Review the WQE requirements, submission procedures and deadlines.\nLENGTH: Maximum of 10 single-spaced pages.\nSTYLE: Suitable for submission to a first-rate technical conference or journal.\nCONTENT RESTRICTIONS: The paper must represent work that the student did as a graduate student at UCLA. Students must explicitly acknowledge in detail any contributions, including those of their faculty advisor, that are not their own. Any contributions to the paper that are not the student’s, including those of their advisor, must be explicitly acknowledged in detail. Specifically, on the first page of the WQE paper, in a separate paragraph at the end of the abstract, the student is required to specify, in detail, which parts of the paper represent the student’s own intellectual contributions. They also need to acknowledge that the paper is written entirely by the student. Any parts of the paper that are the contributions of others, including the advisor(s), must also be explicitly acknowledged in detail. There must be a separate sentence detailing the advisor’s contribution to the research and paper. In addition, there must be a different sentence describing the contributions of each co-author of the paper, if any.\nPREPARATION: An individual studies class, CS597B: Preparation for Ph.D. Preliminary Examination, is offered for variable units (2-12) and may be used to satisfy the minimum 12-unit course work requirement each quarter.\nSUBMISSION PROCESS: The paper must first be approved for submission by the student’s faculty advisor. Their signature on the WQE Cover Page is proof of approval. The WQE Cover Page then must be turned in to the Graduate Student Affairs Office at helen@cs.ucla.edu by the posted deadline. There are two deadlines a year for submission of papers, one in the fall quarter and the other in the spring quarter. Students are emailed a WQE announcement including dates and instructions after the start of the fall and the winter quarters.\nREVIEW PROCESS: After submission, the WQE will be reviewed by at least two other members of the faculty. Students will receive via email an evaluation and whether or not they have passed the WQE.\nNOTE: Ph.D. students who want to receive a master’s degree along the way may substitute a passing WQE for the master’s comprehensive examination.\n\n\nCOM SCI 201 Seminar Requirement\n\nPhD students must complete at least three quarters of Computer Science 201 with grades of Satisfactory (in addition to the three quarters of CS 201 that may have been completed for the M.S. degree).\nCompletion of the seminars will be reviewed when students submit the Proposal of Fields form.\nStudents who plan to add the CS MS degree along the way must complete six quarters of COM SCI 201 with an ‘S’ grade.\n\n\nProposal of Fields (POF)\n\n\nThe Proposal of Fields (POF) consists of one major field and two minor fields. The major field and at least one minor field must be in computer science. All major and minor field courses must be taken for a letter grade. To satisfy the major field requirement, students are expected to attain a body of knowledge contained in five courses, as well as the current literature in the area of specialization. In particular, students are required to take a minimum of three graduate courses in the major field of Ph.D. research, selecting these courses in accordance with guidelines specific to the major field. Grades of B-minus or better, with a grade-point average of at least 3.33 in all courses used to satisfy the major field requirement, are required. Students are required to satisfy the major field requirement by the end of their 3rd year (9th quarter) of enrollment and before taking the Oral Qualifying Examination (OQE). Each minor field normally embraces a body of knowledge equivalent to two courses, at least one of which is a graduate course. Grades of B-minus or better, with a grade-point average of at least 3.33 in all courses included in the minor field, are required. At least one minor field must be in computer science. Both minors must be completed prior to the OQE.\nSTANDARD PROPOSALS: Refer to the Proposal of Fields Guidelines for composing major and minor proposals in established fields. If the courses in a major or a minor field proposal adhere to these guidelines, the field will not require the signature of the corresponding field chair. The established fields are as follows: Artificial Intelligence, Computational Systems Biology, Computer System Architecture, Computer Science Theory, Data Science Computing, Graphics and Vision, Network Systems, and Software Systems.\nPROPOSALS WITH ONE OR MORE COURSE SUBSTITUTIONS: A major or a minor field proposal in an established field that deviates from the standard guidelines by one or more course substitutions must be approved by the corresponding field chair (who may consult with faculty in the field). The list of current Field Chairs is available on the last page of the Proposal of Fields Guidelines.\nTo submit a petition for a course not listed, send a separate email for each course requiring a petition to the field chair to review. Copy helen@cs.ucla.edu in each email. Include a brief justification for the substitution. Include the course syllabus and a transcript with the class marked or highlighted so the certifying instructor can quickly confirm.\nCOURSE WORK TAKEN AT OTHER INSTITUTIONS: No more than three equivalent or related graduate courses taken at other institutions may be applied to the major or minor field requirements, subject to the following:\n\nIf a course taken at another institution is included in a major or minor field proposal, and falls within an established field, the proposal will be considered a deviation from the standard guidelines and must be approved by the corresponding field chair.\nThe graduate course must be taken while a graduate student.\nThe graduate course cannot have been applied toward an undergraduate degree.\n\nAD-HOC PROPOSAL: A major or minor field proposal that does not fall in one of the established fields is considered an ad-hoc field proposal. Guidelines for consideration follow:\n\nThe department must approve all proposals for an ad-hoc field. Students are strongly encouraged to submit their ad-hoc proposal for approval BEFORE taking any of the proposed courses.\nThe ad-hoc field should be a coherent set of courses in an identifiable area (body of knowledge) that is not a subfield of the area of the major or the minors. The ad-hoc field should provide a perspective that is different from the other fields. It cannot merely be a collection of three useful classes.\nIf the ad-hoc field presents some overlap with topics that are generally associated with the other fields, the student must provide a justification that carefully explains why this overlap does not impinge on the value of the minor to broadening the academic experience. (If the Academic Policy Committee [APC] finds such an overlap, the students may be required to provide more information.)\nAd-hoc minor cannot include courses that are listed either as core or ancillary of other proposed major and minor. For example, a proposal with the DSC major cannot include any courses listed in the DSC core and ancillary lists in the ad-hoc minor.\n\nAD-HOC PROPOSAL SUBMISSION & APPROVAL PROCEDURES: The proposal for an ad-hoc field must be included in a completed Proposal of Fields and must be submitted together with a detailed, written justification explaining how the proposed ad-hoc field meets the requirements above and supports a research area. Include details on the proposed classes for the field (course description and/or course syllabus for each class). Email a scanned copy of the completed Proposal of Fields to Diana Valdes by Friday of Week 5. Refer to list of current Field Chairs. The subject line should read “Proposal for Ad-Hoc Field”. Approval of an ad-hoc field proposal requires a majority vote of the Academic Policy Committee (APC). The APC Chair, on behalf of the committee, will inform students and the CS Graduate Student Affairs Office by email when a decision is reached.\nThe POF form, guidelines, and procedures are available here: Proposal of Fields.\n\n\n\nAdding an MS Degree Along the Way\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCS Ph.D. students who have not earned previously a master’s in computer science, electrical engineering, or similar discipline AND have not advanced to candidacy for the PhD may be awarded an MS degree while working toward the PhD degree by fulfilling all the MS degree requirements. The MS degree and PhD degree may not be conferred in the same quarter, so the process should begin no later than the term in which the MS degree requirements are fulfilled. Students should confer with their faculty advisor about whether they should do a Thesis (Master’s Plan I) or a Capstone Plan (Master’s Plan II). A passed Written Qualifying Examination (WQE) may be substituted for the Capstone Project in Plan II.\nREQUIRED FORMS:\n\nComplete the Advancement to Candidacy Petition. Use instructions on page 1 of this form to fill out the ATC petition. Only the student signature is required. The Grad Office will approve and sign the ATC form.\nDownload a copy of your unofficial transcript and highlight the 9 courses used toward the MS Program of Study. Then merge the transcripts starting on page 2 of the ATC petition. #1 and #2 should be one, single PDF file. Rename this file to “MS, Yourlastname YourUID” (i.e. MS, Bruin 123456789).\nPhD adding MS Degree form (page 2) and Proposed MS Program Study (page 3). If you are taking the WQE in the same quarter you are adding the MS degree, enter the quarter you are taking the WQE. If CS 201 or any other courses are currently in progress in the quarter you are adding the MS degree, mark the grade as “TBD.” We will take care of the necessary signatures. Rename this file to “Your Name PhDAddingMS” (i.e. Joe Bruin PhDAddingMS).\nM.S. Capstone Project Results Form (if Plan II is chosen). If applicable, please note on this form that If the WQE is being substituted for the Capstone Project. Committee signatures should be left blank since you are PhD student using the WQE instead. Rename this file to “Your Name MS Capstone Form” (i.e. Joe Bruin Capstone Form).\n\n\n\nDEADLINE:Submit all materials to jalvarez@cs.ucla.eduno later than Friday of Week 2 of the quarter in which the MS degree is to be awarded. If all documents and the thesis or comprehensive examination are submitted according to deadlines, the “degree awarded” date will be the graduation date of that term.\nFAQ:\n\nDo I need to pass the WQE before adding the MS degree? No, you may take the WQE in the same quarter you want to add the MS degree. Awarding of the MS degree will be contingent upon you passing the WQE. Students may indicate on the required MS forms above that the WQE is currently in progress.\nDo I need to finish 9 courses and six CS 201s a quarter before adding the MS degree? No, you may take your remaining courses in-progress and add the MS degree in the same quarter. Students must show they are enrolled in the last course(s) needed to complete the MS program of study. Awarding of the MS degree will be contingent upon you passing the final course(s). Students may indicate on the required MS forms above which course(s) are currently in progress.\nAre the course requirements the same for the CS MS and PhD degrees? While both degrees require 9 courses and the 9 courses may (often do) overlap, students should ensure they are satisfying both requirements separately. The MS degree requires a certain number of 200-level CS courses and electives within CS or Engineering. While the Proposal of Fields may allow graduate course substitutions from other universities or other departments, the MS degree does not. Therefore, students are encouraged to review both sets of requirements to ensure their course selections satisfy both degrees. The MS degree requires students to take their 9 courses as a graduate student at UCLA.\nI don’t plan to advance to candidacy (ATC) or do my Oral Qualifying Exam (OQE) yet. When should I add the MS degree? The master’s ATC and the doctoral ATC are two separate procedures. The master’s ATC (if students wish to add the MS degree) must occur before the doctoral ATC. To ATC for the master’s degree, PhD students typically take six CS 201s, complete the MS program of study, and the WQE. Students should add the MS degree in the quarter they are taking their last MS course requirement(s) and/or WQE. To ATC for the doctoral degree, PhD students must finish their Proposal of Fields and pass the Oral Qualifying Exam.\nMay I add the MS degree and do my OQE in the same quarter? Yes, as long as 1) the required forms for the master’s ATC are submitted by Friday of Week 2 and 2) you have completed the PhD Proposal of Fields, you may add the MS degree and do the OQE in the same quarter if necessary. The university policy is that the MS ATC must occur the PhD ATC. The official MS ATC confirmation email is typically sent to students during the middle of the quarter. Thus, students who wish to do the OQE in the same quarter are encouraged to schedule the OQE in the second half of the quarter so that the PhD ATC occurs after.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOral Qualifying Exam (OQE) & Advancement To Candidacy (ATC)\n\n\n\nOQE MILESTONE: After passing the WQE, students should form a doctoral committee and prepare to take the Oral Qualifying Examination (OQE). To make satisfactory academic progress, students should take and pass the OQE no later than the end of their 3rd year (9th quarter) of enrollment. The nature and content of the OQE are at the discretion of the doctoral committee, but generally the student gives a talk, followed by questions from the faculty.\nENROLLMENT REQUIREMENT: Students must be enrolled during the quarter they take the OQE. If students take the OQE in the summer, they must have been enrolled in at least 12 units in the preceding Spring quarter.\nADDING AN MS DEGREE ALONG THE WAY: PhD students who have not previously earned a master’s degree may add the MS degree in CS along the way. Students must submit a petition to add the MS degree before the OQE can be held. The MS degree cannot be added after the OQE. Additional instructions can be found in the “Adding an MS Degree Along the Way” section above.\nNOMINATING A DOCTORAL COMMITTEE: The Division of Graduate Education must approve the doctoral committee before the OQE can be held.\nHOW TO PREPARE: Students should familiarize themselves with the regulations for the doctoral qualifying examinations detailed in the Standards & Procedures for Graduate Study at UCLA (pages 15-18).\nORAL QUALIFYING EXAM – CHECKLIST REQUIREMENTS (DUE BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE CAN GO FORWARD)\n\n3 quarters of COM SCI 201 Seminars with ‘S’ grades only.

Two of the three required UCLA doctoral committee members must hold the rank of professor or associate professor (regular or in-residence series). The Chair always must hold a current UCLA Academic Senate faculty appointment in the same department as the student.\nThere are more detailed Doctoral Committee Regulations, printed in Standards and Procedures for Graduate Study at UCLA (page 17).\nConfirm with each committee member that they agree to serve on your committee before nominating them.\nComplete the Nomination of Doctoral Committee Form. Leave the last section of the form blank.\nEmail the completed document and attach CVs (if needed) to Juliana Alvarez 6 weeks prior to the exam to review with the Graduate Vice Chair.\n\nREMOTE REQUEST – IF NECESSARY (6 WEEKS BEFORE EXAM)\n\nUCLA faculty and students must attend oral qualifying examinations in person. If the student requests it or agrees to a request from the committee chair or cochairs, non-UCLA faculty or external subject matter experts serving on doctoral committees may participate remotely in oral qualifying examinations and final defenses with the approval of the committee chair or co-chairs. Requests for the remote participation of the student or UCLA faculty require special approval from the Chair or Vice Chair of Graduate Studies. Approval may be granted for the following reasons: health reasons, UCLA faculty on sabbatical or on leave, or travelling off campus for research purposes such as attending conferences.\nReport the committee member(s) participating remotely using the Remote Participation and Exception Request Form.\nAfter obtaining the committee chair’s signature, email the form to Diana Valdes for review with the Graduate Vice Chair for approval.\n\nSCHEDULE A ROOM (4 WEEKS BEFORE EXAM)\n\nCoordinate with your committee to find a date and time that will work for all of them\nConference room reservation requests may be submitted online. Request will be processed within 7 days. Room reservations submissions will be prioritized by the order received. Once your reservation has been made, it will be pending until approved. Once approved, you will receive an email from Jade Hill through your email associated with your login (@cs.ucla.edu).\n\nSUBMIT PROSPECTUS TO DOCTORAL COMMITTEE (2 WEEKS BEFORE EXAM)\n\nEmail or deliver your prospectus to each of your committee members\nEmail Diana Valdes and include the following information:\n\nOQE date, time, and location\nAttach a copy of your prospectus\n\n\n\nAFTER YOU COMPLETE YOUR QUALS, the doctoral committee chair submits the Report on Oral Qualifying Exam to CS Graduate Student Affairs Office. Once the report is processed, you will be charged fees that total $90 (for your Candidacy for Doctoral Degree). We suggest you check your BruinBill 10-15 days after you complete your Quals.\nDue to various University Policies, failure to complete these steps without their allotted lead time (6 weeks, 4 weeks, and 2 weeks prior to your scheduled exam) may result in requiring you to reschedule your exam.\nAn individual studies class, CS597C: Preparation for Ph.D. Oral Qualifying Examination, is offered for variable units (2-12) and may be used to satisfy the minimum 12-unit requirement each quarter.\nNRST WAIVER: Beginning the quarter immediately after the OQE is passed, non-resident supplemental tuition (NRST) is waived for up to nine quarters. If nine quarters pass without the filing of the dissertation, non-resident tuition charges are reinstituted.\n\n\n\n\nDoctoral Dissertation and Filing Fee\n\n\n\n\nAfter successfully completing the final defense, students are expected to soon be ready to file their dissertation. Students must follow the official UCLA manuscript preparation guide for Thesis and Dissertation Filing Requirements.  All Ph.D. students expecting to graduate in a given quarter are strongly encouraged to attend a dissertation filing workshop scheduled at the beginning of each quarter at the Charles E. Young Research Library.\nDOCTORAL FILING FEE: In the term that students intend to file their dissertation, they may apply for Filing Fee instead of enrolling for courses on the condition that they are completing only their dissertation. Filing fee status may be applied only for one quarter. If students on Filing Fee fail to complete their dissertation by the filing deadline, they must retroactively enroll and pay fees for that quarter. Information and instruction for completing the doctoral Filing Fee application and the Filing Fee application are available here. In approximately 10 business days, students should review their Bruin Bill account for a posting of a charge of $201 for the doctoral Filing Fee. Approximately 5 business days after fee payment, the filing date is posted on the transcript. If filed by the term’s dissertation deadline, the “degree awarded” date will be the graduation date of that term.\nDeadlines are posted in the Resources for Students page.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Defense Checklist\n (OPTIONAL) RECONSTITUTE your doctoral committee (6 WEEKS BEFORE EXAM)\n\nIf you need to add or change a committee member: Complete the RECONSTITUTION OF COMMITTEE FORM.

For example, if you would like to participate in the June 2025 ceremony, you must have filed your doctoral dissertation during Summer 2024, Fall 2024, Winter 2025, or Spring 2025.\nPhD students graduating in the Spring must file their dissertation by an earlier deadline in June if they would like to participate in the UCLA Doctoral Hooding Ceremony. The deadline is posted on the above website. Please note that “Complete Degree Requirements” includes: completion of the online ETD Filing Application, all committee members have reported approval of your manuscript and the passing of the final oral examination (if applicable) to the Division of Graduate Education; submission of a final PDF via ProQuest including requested changes from the Division of Graduate Education, and receipt of the Division of Graduate Education confirmation email of the formal completion of degree requirements. Students should keep in mind that there is a high volume of submissions around this time and that formatting revisions may require several rounds if they are not all addressed the first time.\nUCLA Samueli School of Engineering Commencement Ceremony\nPh.D. students who would like to participate in the Samueli School of Engineering Commencement Ceremony must fill out the commencement survey in the Final Defense Checklist. Eligible participants include those graduating in the Fall, Winter, Spring, and upcoming Summer. For example, if you would like to participate in the June 2025 ceremony, you must have graduated during Fall 2024, Winter 2025, Spring 2025, or plan to graduate by the end of Summer 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoctoral Student Travel Grants\nRegistered CS PhD students are eligible to apply for doctoral travel grants. The purpose of the grant is to encourage eligible UCLA doctoral students to present their work and network at conference in their field, to support travel associated with off-campus research, and to enable students to take advantage of off-campus professional development opportunities.\nEach eligible new and continuing UCLA doctoral student will be provided up to $1,000 total reimbursement that can be used, in whole or in part, at any time throughout he student’s seventh year in the doctoral program, as long as the student and activities meet the eligibility requirements. Expenses may include airfare, transportation, lodging, meals, and conference/workshop registration and fees.\nFor eligibility requirements, deadlines, and procedures, visit the DGE website.\nFields of Study\nArtificial Intelligence\nComputational Systems Biology\nComputer Science Theory\nComputer System Architecture\nData Science Computing\nGraphics and Vision\nNetwork Systems\nSoftware Systems\nDegree Requirements\n\nNormally, Ph.D. students take courses to acquire the knowledge needed to prepare for the written and oral preliminary examinations and for conducting research. The basic program of study is built around the following:\n\nWritten Qualifying Examination (WQE) \nCOM SCI 201 Seminar Requirement (3 quarters)\nProposal of Fields (POF)\nAd-hoc Checklist (if applicable)\nOral Qualifying Examination (OQE) and Advancement to Candidacy (ATC)\nFinal Oral Examination on the Dissertation (Final Defense)\nFiling the Doctoral Dissertation\nAcademic Progress Requirements (Time-to-Degree)\n\n\n\n\n\nTo maintain satisfactory academic progress, Ph.D. students must reach the degree milestones by the following deadlines:\n\nWritten Qualifying Exam:  End of 2nd year (6th quarter)\nCOM SCI 201 Seminar Requirement:  End of 3rd year (9th quarter)\nProposal of Fields:  End of 3rd Year (9th quarter)\nOral Qualifying Exam:  End of 3rd year (9th quarter) Missing this OQE milestone by the 12th quarter will result in an Unsatisfactory outcome in the PhD progress report.\nFinal Defense:  End of 6th year (18th quarter)\n\nThe expected time to graduation of 6 years (18 quarters) accords with Graduate Division rules, which limit students to a maximum of 12 quarters as a teaching assistant and a maximum of 18 quarters combined as either a teaching assistant or research assistant.\nEach year at the end of spring quarter the entire faculty evaluates the academic progress of all Ph.D. students. A summary of each evaluation is sent by email to all students and their faculty advisors. These notifications indicate if the academic progress of students has been satisfactory or unsatisfactory.  By default the evaluations work as follows, but outcomes can differ based on the faculty discussion:\n\nA student who has completed all milestones that are required based on their length of time in the program receives an evaluation of “satisfactory progress.”\nA student who fails to meet one of the above deadlines for the first time receives an evaluation of “unsatisfactory progress.”\nThe student is typically given six months to complete the milestone and is re-evaluated at that point.\nA student who fails to meet the deadline required by a prior evaluation of “unsatisfactory progress” receives an evaluation of “unsatisfactory progress, subject to dismissal.”  The student is typically given six more months to complete the milestone and is notified that they are subject to dismissal from the Ph.D. program if this deadline is not met.\nA student who fails to meet the deadline required by a prior evaluation of “unsatisfactory progress, subject to dismissal” will be discussed by the faculty.  Based on input from the student’s faculty advisor and other information, the faculty may vote to dismiss the student from the Ph.D. program, or they may decide to give the student one more chance and send another “unsatisfactory progress, subject to dismissal” letter. An “unsatisfactory progress, subject to dismissal” evaluation may also affect a student’s eligibility for a TA assignment.\n\nStudents who fail to meet requirements may be recommended for termination of graduate study. Graduate students may be disqualified from continuing in the graduate program for a variety of reasons. The most common is failure to maintain the minimum cumulative grade point average (3.00) required by the Academic Senate to remain in good standing. Other examples include failure of examinations, lack of timely progress toward the degree, and poor performance in core courses. Probationary students (those with cumulative grade point averages below 3.00 or if the student’s work in any two consecutive terms fall below a 3.00) are subject to immediate dismissal upon the recommendation of their department. University guidelines governing the termination of graduate students, including the appeal procedure, are outlined in Standards and Procedures for Graduate Study at UCLA (found here).\nWritten Qualifying Exam (WQE)\n\nThe written qualifying examination (WQE) is the preliminary written examination for all Computer Science Ph.D. students in the Fall and Spring quarters only. The WQE consists of a high-quality paper, solely written by the student. The paper can be either a research paper containing an original contribution, or a focused critical survey paper. The paper should demonstrate the student’s understanding of the subject area, as well as their ability to integrate and communicate ideas clearly and concisely. To make satisfactory academic progress, students should take and pass the WQE no later than their 2nd year (6th quarter) of enrollment. Students must be enrolled during the quarter they take the WQE. Review the WQE requirements, submission procedures and deadlines.\nLENGTH: Maximum of 10 single-spaced pages.\nSTYLE: Suitable for submission to a first-rate technical conference or journal.\nCONTENT RESTRICTIONS: The paper must represent work that the student did as a graduate student at UCLA. Students must explicitly acknowledge in detail any contributions, including those of their faculty advisor, that are not their own. Any contributions to the paper that are not the student’s, including those of their advisor, must be explicitly acknowledged in detail. Specifically, on the first page of the WQE paper, in a separate paragraph at the end of the abstract, the student is required to specify, in detail, which parts of the paper represent the student’s own intellectual contributions. They also need to acknowledge that the paper is written entirely by the student. Any parts of the paper that are the contributions of others, including the advisor(s), must also be explicitly acknowledged in detail. There must be a separate sentence detailing the advisor’s contribution to the research and paper. In addition, there must be a different sentence describing the contributions of each co-author of the paper, if any.\nPREPARATION: An individual studies class, CS597B: Preparation for Ph.D. Preliminary Examination, is offered for variable units (2-12) and may be used to satisfy the minimum 12-unit course work requirement each quarter.\nSUBMISSION PROCESS: The paper must first be approved for submission by the student’s faculty advisor. Their signature on the WQE Cover Page is proof of approval. The WQE Cover Page then must be turned in to the Graduate Student Affairs Office at helen@cs.ucla.edu by the posted deadline. There are two deadlines a year for submission of papers, one in the fall quarter and the other in the spring quarter. Students are emailed a WQE announcement including dates and instructions after the start of the fall and the winter quarters.\nREVIEW PROCESS: After submission, the WQE will be reviewed by at least two other members of the faculty. Students will receive via email an evaluation and whether or not they have passed the WQE.\nNOTE: Ph.D. students who want to receive a master’s degree along the way may substitute a passing WQE for the master’s comprehensive examination.\nCOM SCI 201 Seminar Requirement\n\nPhD students must complete at least three quarters of Computer Science 201 with grades of Satisfactory (in addition to the three quarters of CS 201 that may have been completed for the M.S. degree).\nCompletion of the seminars will be reviewed when students submit the Proposal of Fields form.\nStudents who plan to add the CS MS degree along the way must complete six quarters of COM SCI 201 with an ‘S’ grade.\nProposal of Fields (POF)\n\n\nThe Proposal of Fields (POF) consists of one major field and two minor fields. The major field and at least one minor field must be in computer science. All major and minor field courses must be taken for a letter grade. To satisfy the major field requirement, students are expected to attain a body of knowledge contained in five courses, as well as the current literature in the area of specialization. In particular, students are required to take a minimum of three graduate courses in the major field of Ph.D. research, selecting these courses in accordance with guidelines specific to the major field. Grades of B-minus or better, with a grade-point average of at least 3.33 in all courses used to satisfy the major field requirement, are required. Students are required to satisfy the major field requirement by the end of their 3rd year (9th quarter) of enrollment and before taking the Oral Qualifying Examination (OQE). Each minor field normally embraces a body of knowledge equivalent to two courses, at least one of which is a graduate course. Grades of B-minus or better, with a grade-point average of at least 3.33 in all courses included in the minor field, are required. At least one minor field must be in computer science. Both minors must be completed prior to the OQE.\nSTANDARD PROPOSALS: Refer to the Proposal of Fields Guidelines for composing major and minor proposals in established fields. If the courses in a major or a minor field proposal adhere to these guidelines, the field will not require the signature of the corresponding field chair. The established fields are as follows: Artificial Intelligence, Computational Systems Biology, Computer System Architecture, Computer Science Theory, Data Science Computing, Graphics and Vision, Network Systems, and Software Systems.\nPROPOSALS WITH ONE OR MORE COURSE SUBSTITUTIONS: A major or a minor field proposal in an established field that deviates from the standard guidelines by one or more course substitutions must be approved by the corresponding field chair (who may consult with faculty in the field). The list of current Field Chairs is available on the last page of the Proposal of Fields Guidelines.\nTo submit a petition for a course not listed, send a separate email for each course requiring a petition to the field chair to review. Copy helen@cs.ucla.edu in each email. Include a brief justification for the substitution. Include the course syllabus and a transcript with the class marked or highlighted so the certifying instructor can quickly confirm.\nCOURSE WORK TAKEN AT OTHER INSTITUTIONS: No more than three equivalent or related graduate courses taken at other institutions may be applied to the major or minor field requirements, subject to the following:\n\nIf a course taken at another institution is included in a major or minor field proposal, and falls within an established field, the proposal will be considered a deviation from the standard guidelines and must be approved by the corresponding field chair.\nThe graduate course must be taken while a graduate student.\nThe graduate course cannot have been applied toward an undergraduate degree.\n\nAD-HOC PROPOSAL: A major or minor field proposal that does not fall in one of the established fields is considered an ad-hoc field proposal. Guidelines for consideration follow:\n\nThe department must approve all proposals for an ad-hoc field. Students are strongly encouraged to submit their ad-hoc proposal for approval BEFORE taking any of the proposed courses.\nThe ad-hoc field should be a coherent set of courses in an identifiable area (body of knowledge) that is not a subfield of the area of the major or the minors. The ad-hoc field should provide a perspective that is different from the other fields. It cannot merely be a collection of three useful classes.\nIf the ad-hoc field presents some overlap with topics that are generally associated with the other fields, the student must provide a justification that carefully explains why this overlap does not impinge on the value of the minor to broadening the academic experience. (If the Academic Policy Committee [APC] finds such an overlap, the students may be required to provide more information.)\nAd-hoc minor cannot include courses that are listed either as core or ancillary of other proposed major and minor. For example, a proposal with the DSC major cannot include any courses listed in the DSC core and ancillary lists in the ad-hoc minor.\n\nAD-HOC PROPOSAL SUBMISSION & APPROVAL PROCEDURES: The proposal for an ad-hoc field must be included in a completed Proposal of Fields and must be submitted together with a detailed, written justification explaining how the proposed ad-hoc field meets the requirements above and supports a research area. Include details on the proposed classes for the field (course description and/or course syllabus for each class). Email a scanned copy of the completed Proposal of Fields to Diana Valdes by Friday of Week 5. Refer to list of current Field Chairs. The subject line should read “Proposal for Ad-Hoc Field”. Approval of an ad-hoc field proposal requires a majority vote of the Academic Policy Committee (APC). The APC Chair, on behalf of the committee, will inform students and the CS Graduate Student Affairs Office by email when a decision is reached.\nThe POF form, guidelines, and procedures are available here: Proposal of Fields.\nAdding an MS Degree Along the Way\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCS Ph.D. students who have not earned previously a master’s in computer science, electrical engineering, or similar discipline AND have not advanced to candidacy for the PhD may be awarded an MS degree while working toward the PhD degree by fulfilling all the MS degree requirements. The MS degree and PhD degree may not be conferred in the same quarter, so the process should begin no later than the term in which the MS degree requirements are fulfilled. Students should confer with their faculty advisor about whether they should do a Thesis (Master’s Plan I) or a Capstone Plan (Master’s Plan II). A passed Written Qualifying Examination (WQE) may be substituted for the Capstone Project in Plan II.\nREQUIRED FORMS:\n\nComplete the Advancement to Candidacy Petition. Use instructions on page 1 of this form to fill out the ATC petition. Only the student signature is required. The Grad Office will approve and sign the ATC form.\nDownload a copy of your unofficial transcript and highlight the 9 courses used toward the MS Program of Study. Then merge the transcripts starting on page 2 of the ATC petition. #1 and #2 should be one, single PDF file. Rename this file to “MS, Yourlastname YourUID” (i.e. MS, Bruin 123456789).\nPhD adding MS Degree form (page 2) and Proposed MS Program Study (page 3). If you are taking the WQE in the same quarter you are adding the MS degree, enter the quarter you are taking the WQE. If CS 201 or any other courses are currently in progress in the quarter you are adding the MS degree, mark the grade as “TBD.” We will take care of the necessary signatures. Rename this file to “Your Name PhDAddingMS” (i.e. Joe Bruin PhDAddingMS).\nM.S. Capstone Project Results Form (if Plan II is chosen). If applicable, please note on this form that If the WQE is being substituted for the Capstone Project. Committee signatures should be left blank since you are PhD student using the WQE instead. Rename this file to “Your Name MS Capstone Form” (i.e. Joe Bruin Capstone Form).\n\n\n\nDEADLINE:Submit all materials to jalvarez@cs.ucla.eduno later than Friday of Week 2 of the quarter in which the MS degree is to be awarded. If all documents and the thesis or comprehensive examination are submitted according to deadlines, the “degree awarded” date will be the graduation date of that term.\nFAQ:\n\nDo I need to pass the WQE before adding the MS degree? No, you may take the WQE in the same quarter you want to add the MS degree. Awarding of the MS degree will be contingent upon you passing the WQE. Students may indicate on the required MS forms above that the WQE is currently in progress.\nDo I need to finish 9 courses and six CS 201s a quarter before adding the MS degree? No, you may take your remaining courses in-progress and add the MS degree in the same quarter. Students must show they are enrolled in the last course(s) needed to complete the MS program of study. Awarding of the MS degree will be contingent upon you passing the final course(s). Students may indicate on the required MS forms above which course(s) are currently in progress.\nAre the course requirements the same for the CS MS and PhD degrees? While both degrees require 9 courses and the 9 courses may (often do) overlap, students should ensure they are satisfying both requirements separately. The MS degree requires a certain number of 200-level CS courses and electives within CS or Engineering. While the Proposal of Fields may allow graduate course substitutions from other universities or other departments, the MS degree does not. Therefore, students are encouraged to review both sets of requirements to ensure their course selections satisfy both degrees. The MS degree requires students to take their 9 courses as a graduate student at UCLA.\nI don’t plan to advance to candidacy (ATC) or do my Oral Qualifying Exam (OQE) yet. When should I add the MS degree? The master’s ATC and the doctoral ATC are two separate procedures. The master’s ATC (if students wish to add the MS degree) must occur before the doctoral ATC. To ATC for the master’s degree, PhD students typically take six CS 201s, complete the MS program of study, and the WQE. Students should add the MS degree in the quarter they are taking their last MS course requirement(s) and/or WQE. To ATC for the doctoral degree, PhD students must finish their Proposal of Fields and pass the Oral Qualifying Exam.\nMay I add the MS degree and do my OQE in the same quarter? Yes, as long as 1) the required forms for the master’s ATC are submitted by Friday of Week 2 and 2) you have completed the PhD Proposal of Fields, you may add the MS degree and do the OQE in the same quarter if necessary. The university policy is that the MS ATC must occur the PhD ATC. The official MS ATC confirmation email is typically sent to students during the middle of the quarter. Thus, students who wish to do the OQE in the same quarter are encouraged to schedule the OQE in the second half of the quarter so that the PhD ATC occurs after.\nOral Qualifying Exam (OQE) & Advancement To Candidacy (ATC)\n\n\n\nOQE MILESTONE: After passing the WQE, students should form a doctoral committee and prepare to take the Oral Qualifying Examination (OQE). To make satisfactory academic progress, students should take and pass the OQE no later than the end of their 3rd year (9th quarter) of enrollment. The nature and content of the OQE are at the discretion of the doctoral committee, but generally the student gives a talk, followed by questions from the faculty.\nENROLLMENT REQUIREMENT: Students must be enrolled during the quarter they take the OQE. If students take the OQE in the summer, they must have been enrolled in at least 12 units in the preceding Spring quarter.\nADDING AN MS DEGREE ALONG THE WAY: PhD students who have not previously earned a master’s degree may add the MS degree in CS along the way. Students must submit a petition to add the MS degree before the OQE can be held. The MS degree cannot be added after the OQE. Additional instructions can be found in the “Adding an MS Degree Along the Way” section above.\nNOMINATING A DOCTORAL COMMITTEE: The Division of Graduate Education must approve the doctoral committee before the OQE can be held.\nHOW TO PREPARE: Students should familiarize themselves with the regulations for the doctoral qualifying examinations detailed in the Standards & Procedures for Graduate Study at UCLA (pages 15-18).\nORAL QUALIFYING EXAM – CHECKLIST REQUIREMENTS (DUE BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE CAN GO FORWARD)\n\n3 quarters of COM SCI 201 Seminars with ‘S’ grades only.

Once the report is processed, you will be charged fees that total $90 (for your Candidacy for Doctoral Degree). We suggest you check your BruinBill 10-15 days after you complete your Quals.\nDue to various University Policies, failure to complete these steps without their allotted lead time (6 weeks, 4 weeks, and 2 weeks prior to your scheduled exam) may result in requiring you to reschedule your exam.\nAn individual studies class, CS597C: Preparation for Ph.D. Oral Qualifying Examination, is offered for variable units (2-12) and may be used to satisfy the minimum 12-unit requirement each quarter.\nNRST WAIVER: Beginning the quarter immediately after the OQE is passed, non-resident supplemental tuition (NRST) is waived for up to nine quarters. If nine quarters pass without the filing of the dissertation, non-resident tuition charges are reinstituted.\nDoctoral Dissertation and Filing Fee\n\n\n\n\nAfter successfully completing the final defense, students are expected to soon be ready to file their dissertation. Students must follow the official UCLA manuscript preparation guide for Thesis and Dissertation Filing Requirements.  All Ph.D. students expecting to graduate in a given quarter are strongly encouraged to attend a dissertation filing workshop scheduled at the beginning of each quarter at the Charles E. Young Research Library.\nDOCTORAL FILING FEE: In the term that students intend to file their dissertation, they may apply for Filing Fee instead of enrolling for courses on the condition that they are completing only their dissertation. Filing fee status may be applied only for one quarter. If students on Filing Fee fail to complete their dissertation by the filing deadline, they must retroactively enroll and pay fees for that quarter. Information and instruction for completing the doctoral Filing Fee application and the Filing Fee application are available here. In approximately 10 business days, students should review their Bruin Bill account for a posting of a charge of $201 for the doctoral Filing Fee. Approximately 5 business days after fee payment, the filing date is posted on the transcript. If filed by the term’s dissertation deadline, the “degree awarded” date will be the graduation date of that term.\nDeadlines are posted in the Resources for Students page.\nFinal Defense Checklist\n (OPTIONAL) RECONSTITUTE your doctoral committee (6 WEEKS BEFORE EXAM)\n\nIf you need to add or change a committee member: Complete the RECONSTITUTION OF COMMITTEE FORM.

Please note that “Complete Degree Requirements” includes: completion of the online ETD Filing Application, all committee members have reported approval of your manuscript and the passing of the final oral examination (if applicable) to the Division of Graduate Education; submission of a final PDF via ProQuest including requested changes from the Division of Graduate Education, and receipt of the Division of Graduate Education confirmation email of the formal completion of degree requirements. Students should keep in mind that there is a high volume of submissions around this time and that formatting revisions may require several rounds if they are not all addressed the first time.\nUCLA Samueli School of Engineering Commencement Ceremony\nPh.D. students who would like to participate in the Samueli School of Engineering Commencement Ceremony must fill out the commencement survey in the Final Defense Checklist. Eligible participants include those graduating in the Fall, Winter, Spring, and upcoming Summer. For example, if you would like to participate in the June 2025 ceremony, you must have graduated during Fall 2024, Winter 2025, Spring 2025, or plan to graduate by the end of Summer 2025.\nDoctoral Student Travel Grants\nRegistered CS PhD students are eligible to apply for doctoral travel grants. The purpose of the grant is to encourage eligible UCLA doctoral students to present their work and network at conference in their field, to support travel associated with off-campus research, and to enable students to take advantage of off-campus professional development opportunities.\nEach eligible new and continuing UCLA doctoral student will be provided up to $1,000 total reimbursement that can be used, in whole or in part, at any time throughout he student’s seventh year in the doctoral program, as long as the student and activities meet the eligibility requirements. Expenses may include airfare, transportation, lodging, meals, and conference/workshop registration and fees.\nFor eligibility requirements, deadlines, and procedures, visit the DGE website.\n[GRID_TABLE]\nFields of Study\nArtificial Intelligence\nComputational Systems Biology\nComputer Science Theory\nComputer System Architecture\nData Science Computing\nGraphics and Vision\nNetwork Systems\nSoftware Systems\nDegree Requirements\n\nNormally, Ph.D. students take courses to acquire the knowledge needed to prepare for the written and oral preliminary examinations and for conducting research. The basic program of study is built around the following:\n\nWritten Qualifying Examination (WQE) \nCOM SCI 201 Seminar Requirement (3 quarters)\nProposal of Fields (POF)\nAd-hoc Checklist (if applicable)\nOral Qualifying Examination (OQE) and Advancement to Candidacy (ATC)\nFinal Oral Examination on the Dissertation (Final Defense)\nFiling the Doctoral Dissertation\nAcademic Progress Requirements (Time-to-Degree)\n\n\n\n\n\nTo maintain satisfactory academic progress, Ph.D. students must reach the degree milestones by the following deadlines:\n\nWritten Qualifying Exam:  End of 2nd year (6th quarter)\nCOM SCI 201 Seminar Requirement:  End of 3rd year (9th quarter)\nProposal of Fields:  End of 3rd Year (9th quarter)\nOral Qualifying Exam:  End of 3rd year (9th quarter) Missing this OQE milestone by the 12th quarter will result in an Unsatisfactory outcome in the PhD progress report.\nFinal Defense:  End of 6th year (18th quarter)\n\nThe expected time to graduation of 6 years (18 quarters) accords with Graduate Division rules, which limit students to a maximum of 12 quarters as a teaching assistant and a maximum of 18 quarters combined as either a teaching assistant or research assistant.\nEach year at the end of spring quarter the entire faculty evaluates the academic progress of all Ph.D. students. A summary of each evaluation is sent by email to all students and their faculty advisors. These notifications indicate if the academic progress of students has been satisfactory or unsatisfactory.  By default the evaluations work as follows, but outcomes can differ based on the faculty discussion:\n\nA student who has completed all milestones that are required based on their length of time in the program receives an evaluation of “satisfactory progress.”\nA student who fails to meet one of the above deadlines for the first time receives an evaluation of “unsatisfactory progress.”\nThe student is typically given six months to complete the milestone and is re-evaluated at that point.\nA student who fails to meet the deadline required by a prior evaluation of “unsatisfactory progress” receives an evaluation of “unsatisfactory progress, subject to dismissal.”  The student is typically given six more months to complete the milestone and is notified that they are subject to dismissal from the Ph.D. program if this deadline is not met.\nA student who fails to meet the deadline required by a prior evaluation of “unsatisfactory progress, subject to dismissal” will be discussed by the faculty.  Based on input from the student’s faculty advisor and other information, the faculty may vote to dismiss the student from the Ph.D. program, or they may decide to give the student one more chance and send another “unsatisfactory progress, subject to dismissal” letter. An “unsatisfactory progress, subject to dismissal” evaluation may also affect a student’s eligibility for a TA assignment.\n\nStudents who fail to meet requirements may be recommended for termination of graduate study. Graduate students may be disqualified from continuing in the graduate program for a variety of reasons. The most common is failure to maintain the minimum cumulative grade point average (3.00) required by the Academic Senate to remain in good standing. Other examples include failure of examinations, lack of timely progress toward the degree, and poor performance in core courses. Probationary students (those with cumulative grade point averages below 3.00 or if the student’s work in any two consecutive terms fall below a 3.00) are subject to immediate dismissal upon the recommendation of their department. University guidelines governing the termination of graduate students, including the appeal procedure, are outlined in Standards and Procedures for Graduate Study at UCLA (found here).\nWritten Qualifying Exam (WQE)\n\nThe written qualifying examination (WQE) is the preliminary written examination for all Computer Science Ph.D. students in the Fall and Spring quarters only. The WQE consists of a high-quality paper, solely written by the student. The paper can be either a research paper containing an original contribution, or a focused critical survey paper. The paper should demonstrate the student’s understanding of the subject area, as well as their ability to integrate and communicate ideas clearly and concisely. To make satisfactory academic progress, students should take and pass the WQE no later than their 2nd year (6th quarter) of enrollment. Students must be enrolled during the quarter they take the WQE. Review the WQE requirements, submission procedures and deadlines.\nLENGTH: Maximum of 10 single-spaced pages.\nSTYLE: Suitable for submission to a first-rate technical conference or journal.\nCONTENT RESTRICTIONS: The paper must represent work that the student did as a graduate student at UCLA. Students must explicitly acknowledge in detail any contributions, including those of their faculty advisor, that are not their own. Any contributions to the paper that are not the student’s, including those of their advisor, must be explicitly acknowledged in detail. Specifically, on the first page of the WQE paper, in a separate paragraph at the end of the abstract, the student is required to specify, in detail, which parts of the paper represent the student’s own intellectual contributions. They also need to acknowledge that the paper is written entirely by the student. Any parts of the paper that are the contributions of others, including the advisor(s), must also be explicitly acknowledged in detail. There must be a separate sentence detailing the advisor’s contribution to the research and paper. In addition, there must be a different sentence describing the contributions of each co-author of the paper, if any.\nPREPARATION: An individual studies class, CS597B: Preparation for Ph.D. Preliminary Examination, is offered for variable units (2-12) and may be used to satisfy the minimum 12-unit course work requirement each quarter.\nSUBMISSION PROCESS: The paper must first be approved for submission by the student’s faculty advisor. Their signature on the WQE Cover Page is proof of approval. The WQE Cover Page then must be turned in to the Graduate Student Affairs Office at helen@cs.ucla.edu by the posted deadline. There are two deadlines a year for submission of papers, one in the fall quarter and the other in the spring quarter. Students are emailed a WQE announcement including dates and instructions after the start of the fall and the winter quarters.\nREVIEW PROCESS: After submission, the WQE will be reviewed by at least two other members of the faculty. Students will receive via email an evaluation and whether or not they have passed the WQE.\nNOTE: Ph.D. students who want to receive a master’s degree along the way may substitute a passing WQE for the master’s comprehensive examination.\nCOM SCI 201 Seminar Requirement\n\nPhD students must complete at least three quarters of Computer Science 201 with grades of Satisfactory (in addition to the three quarters of CS 201 that may have been completed for the M.S. degree).\nCompletion of the seminars will be reviewed when students submit the Proposal of Fields form.\nStudents who plan to add the CS MS degree along the way must complete six quarters of COM SCI 201 with an ‘S’ grade.\nProposal of Fields (POF)\n\n\nThe Proposal of Fields (POF) consists of one major field and two minor fields. The major field and at least one minor field must be in computer science. All major and minor field courses must be taken for a letter grade. To satisfy the major field requirement, students are expected to attain a body of knowledge contained in five courses, as well as the current literature in the area of specialization. In particular, students are required to take a minimum of three graduate courses in the major field of Ph.D. research, selecting these courses in accordance with guidelines specific to the major field. Grades of B-minus or better, with a grade-point average of at least 3.33 in all courses used to satisfy the major field requirement, are required. Students are required to satisfy the major field requirement by the end of their 3rd year (9th quarter) of enrollment and before taking the Oral Qualifying Examination (OQE). Each minor field normally embraces a body of knowledge equivalent to two courses, at least one of which is a graduate course. Grades of B-minus or better, with a grade-point average of at least 3.33 in all courses included in the minor field, are required. At least one minor field must be in computer science. Both minors must be completed prior to the OQE.\nSTANDARD PROPOSALS: Refer to the Proposal of Fields Guidelines for composing major and minor proposals in established fields. If the courses in a major or a minor field proposal adhere to these guidelines, the field will not require the signature of the corresponding field chair. The established fields are as follows: Artificial Intelligence, Computational Systems Biology, Computer System Architecture, Computer Science Theory, Data Science Computing, Graphics and Vision, Network Systems, and Software Systems.\nPROPOSALS WITH ONE OR MORE COURSE SUBSTITUTIONS: A major or a minor field proposal in an established field that deviates from the standard guidelines by one or more course substitutions must be approved by the corresponding field chair (who may consult with faculty in the field). The list of current Field Chairs is available on the last page of the Proposal of Fields Guidelines.\nTo submit a petition for a course not listed, send a separate email for each course requiring a petition to the field chair to review. Copy helen@cs.ucla.edu in each email. Include a brief justification for the substitution. Include the course syllabus and a transcript with the class marked or highlighted so the certifying instructor can quickly confirm.\nCOURSE WORK TAKEN AT OTHER INSTITUTIONS: No more than three equivalent or related graduate courses taken at other institutions may be applied to the major or minor field requirements, subject to the following:\n\nIf a course taken at another institution is included in a major or minor field proposal, and falls within an established field, the proposal will be considered a deviation from the standard guidelines and must be approved by the corresponding field chair.\nThe graduate course must be taken while a graduate student.\nThe graduate course cannot have been applied toward an undergraduate degree.\n\nAD-HOC PROPOSAL: A major or minor field proposal that does not fall in one of the established fields is considered an ad-hoc field proposal. Guidelines for consideration follow:\n\nThe department must approve all proposals for an ad-hoc field. Students are strongly encouraged to submit their ad-hoc proposal for approval BEFORE taking any of the proposed courses.\nThe ad-hoc field should be a coherent set of courses in an identifiable area (body of knowledge) that is not a subfield of the area of the major or the minors. The ad-hoc field should provide a perspective that is different from the other fields. It cannot merely be a collection of three useful classes.\nIf the ad-hoc field presents some overlap with topics that are generally associated with the other fields, the student must provide a justification that carefully explains why this overlap does not impinge on the value of the minor to broadening the academic experience. (If the Academic Policy Committee [APC] finds such an overlap, the students may be required to provide more information.)\nAd-hoc minor cannot include courses that are listed either as core or ancillary of other proposed major and minor. For example, a proposal with the DSC major cannot include any courses listed in the DSC core and ancillary lists in the ad-hoc minor.\n\nAD-HOC PROPOSAL SUBMISSION & APPROVAL PROCEDURES: The proposal for an ad-hoc field must be included in a completed Proposal of Fields and must be submitted together with a detailed, written justification explaining how the proposed ad-hoc field meets the requirements above and supports a research area. Include details on the proposed classes for the field (course description and/or course syllabus for each class). Email a scanned copy of the completed Proposal of Fields to Diana Valdes by Friday of Week 5. Refer to list of current Field Chairs. The subject line should read “Proposal for Ad-Hoc Field”. Approval of an ad-hoc field proposal requires a majority vote of the Academic Policy Committee (APC). The APC Chair, on behalf of the committee, will inform students and the CS Graduate Student Affairs Office by email when a decision is reached.\nThe POF form, guidelines, and procedures are available here: Proposal of Fields.\nAdding an MS Degree Along the Way\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCS Ph.D. students who have not earned previously a master’s in computer science, electrical engineering, or similar discipline AND have not advanced to candidacy for the PhD may be awarded an MS degree while working toward the PhD degree by fulfilling all the MS degree requirements. The MS degree and PhD degree may not be conferred in the same quarter, so the process should begin no later than the term in which the MS degree requirements are fulfilled. Students should confer with their faculty advisor about whether they should do a Thesis (Master’s Plan I) or a Capstone Plan (Master’s Plan II). A passed Written Qualifying Examination (WQE) may be substituted for the Capstone Project in Plan II.\nREQUIRED FORMS:\n\nComplete the Advancement to Candidacy Petition. Use instructions on page 1 of this form to fill out the ATC petition. Only the student signature is required. The Grad Office will approve and sign the ATC form.\nDownload a copy of your unofficial transcript and highlight the 9 courses used toward the MS Program of Study. Then merge the transcripts starting on page 2 of the ATC petition. #1 and #2 should be one, single PDF file. Rename this file to “MS, Yourlastname YourUID” (i.e. MS, Bruin 123456789).\nPhD adding MS Degree form (page 2) and Proposed MS Program Study (page 3). If you are taking the WQE in the same quarter you are adding the MS degree, enter the quarter you are taking the WQE. If CS 201 or any other courses are currently in progress in the quarter you are adding the MS degree, mark the grade as “TBD.” We will take care of the necessary signatures. Rename this file to “Your Name PhDAddingMS” (i.e. Joe Bruin PhDAddingMS).\nM.S. Capstone Project Results Form (if Plan II is chosen). If applicable, please note on this form that If the WQE is being substituted for the Capstone Project. Committee signatures should be left blank since you are PhD student using the WQE instead. Rename this file to “Your Name MS Capstone Form” (i.e. Joe Bruin Capstone Form).\n\n\n\nDEADLINE:Submit all materials to jalvarez@cs.ucla.eduno later than Friday of Week 2 of the quarter in which the MS degree is to be awarded. If all documents and the thesis or comprehensive examination are submitted according to deadlines, the “degree awarded” date will be the graduation date of that term.\nFAQ:\n\nDo I need to pass the WQE before adding the MS degree? No, you may take the WQE in the same quarter you want to add the MS degree. Awarding of the MS degree will be contingent upon you passing the WQE. Students may indicate on the required MS forms above that the WQE is currently in progress.\nDo I need to finish 9 courses and six CS 201s a quarter before adding the MS degree? No, you may take your remaining courses in-progress and add the MS degree in the same quarter. Students must show they are enrolled in the last course(s) needed to complete the MS program of study. Awarding of the MS degree will be contingent upon you passing the final course(s). Students may indicate on the required MS forms above which course(s) are currently in progress.\nAre the course requirements the same for the CS MS and PhD degrees? While both degrees require 9 courses and the 9 courses may (often do) overlap, students should ensure they are satisfying both requirements separately. The MS degree requires a certain number of 200-level CS courses and electives within CS or Engineering. While the Proposal of Fields may allow graduate course substitutions from other universities or other departments, the MS degree does not. Therefore, students are encouraged to review both sets of requirements to ensure their course selections satisfy both degrees. The MS degree requires students to take their 9 courses as a graduate student at UCLA.\nI don’t plan to advance to candidacy (ATC) or do my Oral Qualifying Exam (OQE) yet. When should I add the MS degree? The master’s ATC and the doctoral ATC are two separate procedures. The master’s ATC (if students wish to add the MS degree) must occur before the doctoral ATC. To ATC for the master’s degree, PhD students typically take six CS 201s, complete the MS program of study, and the WQE. Students should add the MS degree in the quarter they are taking their last MS course requirement(s) and/or WQE. To ATC for the doctoral degree, PhD students must finish their Proposal of Fields and pass the Oral Qualifying Exam.\nMay I add the MS degree and do my OQE in the same quarter? Yes, as long as 1) the required forms for the master’s ATC are submitted by Friday of Week 2 and 2) you have completed the PhD Proposal of Fields, you may add the MS degree and do the OQE in the same quarter if necessary. The university policy is that the MS ATC must occur the PhD ATC. The official MS ATC confirmation email is typically sent to students during the middle of the quarter. Thus, students who wish to do the OQE in the same quarter are encouraged to schedule the OQE in the second half of the quarter so that the PhD ATC occurs after.\nOral Qualifying Exam (OQE) & Advancement To Candidacy (ATC)\n\n\n\nOQE MILESTONE: After passing the WQE, students should form a doctoral committee and prepare to take the Oral Qualifying Examination (OQE). To make satisfactory academic progress, students should take and pass the OQE no later than the end of their 3rd year (9th quarter) of enrollment. The nature and content of the OQE are at the discretion of the doctoral committee, but generally the student gives a talk, followed by questions from the faculty.\nENROLLMENT REQUIREMENT: Students must be enrolled during the quarter they take the OQE. If students take the OQE in the summer, they must have been enrolled in at least 12 units in the preceding Spring quarter.\nADDING AN MS DEGREE ALONG THE WAY: PhD students who have not previously earned a master’s degree may add the MS degree in CS along the way. Students must submit a petition to add the MS degree before the OQE can be held. The MS degree cannot be added after the OQE. Additional instructions can be found in the “Adding an MS Degree Along the Way” section above.\nNOMINATING A DOCTORAL COMMITTEE: The Division of Graduate Education must approve the doctoral committee before the OQE can be held.\nHOW TO PREPARE: Students should familiarize themselves with the regulations for the doctoral qualifying examinations detailed in the Standards & Procedures for Graduate Study at UCLA (pages 15-18).\nORAL QUALIFYING EXAM – CHECKLIST REQUIREMENTS (DUE BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE CAN GO FORWARD)\n\n3 quarters of COM SCI 201 Seminars with ‘S’ grades only.

We suggest you check your BruinBill 10-15 days after you complete your Quals.\nDue to various University Policies, failure to complete these steps without their allotted lead time (6 weeks, 4 weeks, and 2 weeks prior to your scheduled exam) may result in requiring you to reschedule your exam.\nAn individual studies class, CS597C: Preparation for Ph.D. Oral Qualifying Examination, is offered for variable units (2-12) and may be used to satisfy the minimum 12-unit requirement each quarter.\nNRST WAIVER: Beginning the quarter immediately after the OQE is passed, non-resident supplemental tuition (NRST) is waived for up to nine quarters. If nine quarters pass without the filing of the dissertation, non-resident tuition charges are reinstituted.\nDoctoral Dissertation and Filing Fee\n\n\n\n\nAfter successfully completing the final defense, students are expected to soon be ready to file their dissertation. Students must follow the official UCLA manuscript preparation guide for Thesis and Dissertation Filing Requirements.  All Ph.D. students expecting to graduate in a given quarter are strongly encouraged to attend a dissertation filing workshop scheduled at the beginning of each quarter at the Charles E. Young Research Library.\nDOCTORAL FILING FEE: In the term that students intend to file their dissertation, they may apply for Filing Fee instead of enrolling for courses on the condition that they are completing only their dissertation. Filing fee status may be applied only for one quarter. If students on Filing Fee fail to complete their dissertation by the filing deadline, they must retroactively enroll and pay fees for that quarter. Information and instruction for completing the doctoral Filing Fee application and the Filing Fee application are available here. In approximately 10 business days, students should review their Bruin Bill account for a posting of a charge of $201 for the doctoral Filing Fee. Approximately 5 business days after fee payment, the filing date is posted on the transcript. If filed by the term’s dissertation deadline, the “degree awarded” date will be the graduation date of that term.\nDeadlines are posted in the Resources for Students page.\nFinal Defense Checklist\n (OPTIONAL) RECONSTITUTE your doctoral committee (6 WEEKS BEFORE EXAM)\n\nIf you need to add or change a committee member: Complete the RECONSTITUTION OF COMMITTEE FORM.

Expenses may include airfare, transportation, lodging, meals, and conference/workshop registration and fees.\nFor eligibility requirements, deadlines, and procedures, visit the DGE website.\n[GRID_TABLE]\nGeneral Information for All CS Graduate Students\n\nBruin Bill\nAll students are assigned a Bruin Bill account. Your Bruin Bill account records all charges and payments (including housing) associated with registration along with other service charges that are assessed to students. You can access your Bruin Bill through MyUCLA.\nStudents are not notified when charges are posted. Accordingly, students should check their Bruin Bill account regularly. Miscellaneous fees accrue throughout the quarter and are due by the 20th of each month. If unpaid, a late fee will be applied to their Bruin Bill each month.\n\nBruin Alert\n\nBruinAlert was developed to communicate official information during an emergency or crisis that disrupts normal operation of the UCLA campus, or threatens the health and safety of members of the campus community. Students with current email addresses in MyUCLA are automatically enrolled in BruinAlert.\n\n\nCS Email Account \n\n\nBruin OnLine (BOL)\nBruin OnLine (BOL) is a collection of services that provides UCLA students, faculty, and staff with:\nEmail\nNetwork Connectivity, including Wireless\nFree Software and Support\nIn order to have access to BOL services, students must have a UCLA Logon ID. Students can create their UCLA Logon ID at: http://accounts.iam.ucla.edu/\nIn addition to establishing a BOL account, students must set up a CS Account, which serves as the official communication link between students and the CS department.\nCS Account\nFaculty and staff primarily communicate with students through email.
