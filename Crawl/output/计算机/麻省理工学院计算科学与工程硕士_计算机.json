Students must complete coursework distributed as described below (F = course offered in Fall semester; S = course offered in Spring semester).\nStudents are required to take three of four core subjects designed to provide foundation materials needed for the study of more advanced elective topics. The core subjects are chosen from the following:\nStudents choose two graduate-level electives from a list of over 50 specialized subjects that have computational themes and related components, and that are aligned with the program’s educational mission. The current list of approved restricted elective (RE) subjects can be found here.\nStudents may choose any graduate-level 12-unit subject from the MIT Subject Listing and Schedule.\nStudents write a master’s thesis under the supervision of a faculty advisor.\n*Courses that can be repeated for credit cannot be used to satisfy multiple CSE SM requirements. Subjects taken with the graduate P/D/F grading option cannot be used to satisfy CSE SM curricular requirements.\nAll CSE SM students are required to take the Graduate Writing Exam run by the MIT Program in Writing and Humanistic Studies.  Students who do not receive a passing score are required to take 21W.794 Graduate Technical Writing Workshop.  Students may choose to take the workshop with P/D/F grading (rather than an A – F letter grade), however they must receive a P grade.\nThe CSE SM program is designed so that students who are either self-supported or on fellowship can complete the program in 12-18 months. Students supported by research assistant or teaching assistant funds should allow two years to complete the program.\nCSE SM students are expected to maintain a cumulative grade point average (GPA) of at least 4.5 (out of 5) during the course of their studies. If a student’s term GPA is at or below 4.0 for two sequential terms, if a student receives an Unsatisfactory (“U”) grade in CSE.THG, or if a grade of C or lower is given in any subject, a warning from the CCSE directors will be issued to the student, and the MIT Graduate Academic Performance Group will be alerted.\nPlease see the Office of the Dean for Graduate Education’s Academic Performance page for more information.\n• MIT Doctoral Programs in Computational Science and Engineering\n\nCSE PhD Overview\nDept-CSE PhD Overview\n\n\nMIT Master of Science Program in Computational Science and Engineering (CSE SM)\n\nProgram Overview and Curriculum\n\n\nCSE Theses\nMathWorks Research Prizes\n\nTerms of Reference\n• MIT Doctoral Programs in Computational Science and Engineering\n\nCSE PhD Overview\nDept-CSE PhD Overview\n• CSE PhD Overview\n• Dept-CSE PhD Overview\n• MIT Master of Science Program in Computational Science and Engineering (CSE SM)\n\nProgram Overview and Curriculum\n• Program Overview and Curriculum\n• CSE Theses\n• MathWorks Research Prizes\n\nTerms of Reference\n• Terms of Reference\n• MIT Doctoral Programs in Computational Science and Engineering\n\nCSE PhD Overview\nDept-CSE PhD Overview\n• CSE PhD Overview\n• Dept-CSE PhD Overview\n• MIT Master of Science Program in Computational Science and Engineering (CSE SM)\n\nProgram Overview and Curriculum\n• Program Overview and Curriculum\n• CSE Theses\n• MathWorks Research Prizes\n\nTerms of Reference\n• Terms of Reference\n• CSE PhD Overview\n• Dept-CSE PhD Overview\n• Program Overview and Curriculum\n• Terms of Reference\n• CSE SM Thesis Proposal Form1\n• Petition Form: Request for Modification of SM Subject Requirements2\n• SM Subject Audit Form11 CSE SM Thesis Proposal and Subject Audit Forms are due no later than the final pre-registration deadline of the last semester prior to graduation (e.g., the final January pre-registration deadline for May/June graduation; May for September graduation; August for February graduation).2 Petition forms and supporting documents should be submitted as soon as possible; students are strongly advised to submit the form for approval *prior* to enrolling in the petitioned subject.\n• 2.096[J] / 6.7300[J] / 16.910[J] Introduction to Numerical Simulation (F)\n• 2.097[J] / 6.7330[J] / 16.920[J] Numerical Methods for Partial Differential Equations (F)\n• 6.C57[J] / 15.C57[J] / IDS.C57 [J] (formerly 6.7200[J] / 15.093[J]) Optimization Methods (F)\n• 6.7310[J] / 18.335[J] Introduction to Numerical Methods (S)\n[GRID_TABLE]\nMIT Doctoral Programs in Computational Science and Engineering\n\nCSE PhD Overview\nDept-CSE PhD Overview\n\n\nMIT Master of Science Program in Computational Science and Engineering (CSE SM)\n\nProgram Overview and Curriculum\n\n\nCSE Theses\nMathWorks Research Prizes\n\nTerms of Reference\nMIT Doctoral Programs in Computational Science and Engineering\n\nCSE PhD Overview\nDept-CSE PhD Overview\nCSE PhD Overview\nDept-CSE PhD Overview\nMIT Master of Science Program in Computational Science and Engineering (CSE SM)\n\nProgram Overview and Curriculum\nProgram Overview and Curriculum\nCSE Theses\nMathWorks Research Prizes\n\nTerms of Reference\nTerms of Reference\nMaster of Science Program in Computational Science and Engineering (CSE SM)\nThe CSE SM program is designed with a common core that serves all engineering disciplines, and an elective component that focuses on particular applications.

Today's engineers, designers, programmers and architects need to be experts in the skills of their trade, but they also need the skills to work with others to get things done. As work becomes increasingly global in nature, this means communicating effectively with people from across many cultures, identifying and overcoming sources of tension, and creatively combining the strengths that individual team members bring to the table. In this course, participants will:-Gain knowledge of cultural factors that may influence group and individual work dynamics-Understand typical stages of group development-Gain tools for effective communication-Assess their own areas of strength and weakness and identify areas of growth to work on during the program-Explore various paradigms of leadership and analyze them through different cultural lenses-Gain significant experience working in teamsStudents should register on WebSIS and contact instructor to sign up for one of the three sessions. MIT student enrollment in each session limited to 10. 20 students from Singapore University of Technology and Design will also participate in each session.

The standalone CSE PhD program is intended for students who intend to pursue research in cross-cutting methodological aspects of computational science. The resulting doctoral degree in Computational Science and Engineering is awarded by CCSE via the the Schwarzman College of Computing. In contrast, the interdisciplinary CSE PhD program is intended for students who are interested in computation in the context of a specific engineering or science discipline. For this reason, this degree is offered jointly with participating departments across the Institute; the interdisciplinary degree is awarded in a specially crafted thesis field that recognizes the student’s specialization in computation within the chosen engineering or science discipline.\nFor more information about CCSE’s doctoral programs, please explore the links on the left.

      "content": "[HEADING] Graduate Writing Exam: Overview\nUsername or Email Address\nRemember Me\nMIT’s Graduate Writing Exam (GWE) is the first step in many graduate programs. It is taken the summer before matriculation and assesses incoming students’ competency in technical writing, proper use and citation of sources, and usage of standard written English.\nStudents who pass the exam have fulfilled their program’s entry writing requirement. Those who do not pass will be required to take an IAP writing workshop (21W.794 Graduate Technical Writing Workshop) or a full-semester writing course, depending on their department’s policy.\nCurrently, the following departments require that the Graduate Writing Exam be taken by all incoming students:\nPLEASE NOTE: The Writing, Rhetoric, and Professional Communication program (WRAP) administers the GWE, but all subsequent decisions are made by your department. For questions about your results or your department’s passing scores, policies, and individual course requirements, contact your Graduate Administrator.\nPlease see our details page for more information about the exam.\nIf you require any accommodations to complete the GWE, please reach out to das-student@mit.edu before your selected exam period begins to discuss access, accommodations, and services you may need.\n• Mailing List\n• Contact\n• Subjects\n• Give\n• Search\n\nSearch\n• Login\n\nUsername or Email Address\n\n\nPassword\n\n Remember Me\n\n\n\nLost Password?\n• Search\n\nSearch\n• Aeronautics & Astronautics (Course 16)\n• Biological Engineering (Course 20)\n• Chemical Engineering (Course 10)\n• Civil & Environmental Engineering (Course 1)\n• Computational Science & Engineering (CSE)\n• Institute for Data Systems & Society (IDSS)\n• Mechanical Engineering (Course 2)\n• Media Arts & Sciences (MAS)\n• Operations Research Center (ORC)\n• System Design and Management (SDM)\n• Technology & Policy Program (TPP)",
