Please refer to the Academic and Examination Regulations of your degree program (FPSO) for specific details. Please also be aware of the Collective Amendment concerning the proof of English language proficiency (PDF, 143 KB)\nEnglish language proficiency may no longer be proven by school grades (e.g. in the Abitur). An exception may apply to individual Bachelor’s degree programs for which language skills verification is carried out as part of the aptitude assessment.\nFor Master's degree programs, English language proficiency cannot be proven by school grades in any case.\nYou can prove your English language skills through the language of instruction in your previous school or academic education – for example, completed a full secondary school education in English (secondary school leaving certificate must open up direct access to higher education in Germany) or if the language of instruction in a Bachelor’s or Master’s degree program was English – by submitting your transcript of records or your degree certificate as evidence. The language of instruction needs to have been English in at least 50% of the program.\nIf the language of instruction is not stated in these documents, you can submit an official confirmation issued by your prior university.\nFor some Master’s degree programs, a sufficient amount of credits acquired in English modules during your undergraduate studies is accepted as proof of your English language proficiency as well. The information whether this option is valid for a certain degree program and, if so, how many credits you need to have completed in English modules, can be found in the Academic and Examination Regulations of a degree program.\nIf this option is given for a certain degree program, you need to submit your transcript of records or your degree certificate as evidence, as well as the form for verification of English-language proficiency through English-language modules in the undergraduate degree program (PDF, 175 KB).\nFor some Master’s degree programs, for example at the TUM School of Computation, Information and Technology, it is also possible to prove your English-language proficiency by submitting an English-language Bachelor’s thesis. Please note that the thesis must already have been submitted and graded. The English title must be noted in the transcript as a passed credit requirement and the transcript must indicate that the thesis was written in English; otherwise, a separate certificate from the university stating the language of the bachelor's thesis must be submitted. If the Bachelor’s thesis has not yet been graded, it cannot be used as a proof of English language proficiency.\nSemesters spent in an exchange program or internship are not sufficient.\nIn the Bachelor’s degree programs\nEnglish language skills verification is carried out as part of the aptitude assessment.\nIn this process, it is assessed whether the language skills you have acquired at school are sufficient for your studies. For this purpose, proof of your English language skills as provided by your higher education entrance qualification (e.g. Abitur) is checked. Alternatively, the necessary language skills can be verified during the aptitude interview\nThe regulations for your degree program can be found in the corresponding Regulations on Aptitude Assessment.\nA GMAT with a score higher than 600 is accepted as proof of english skills for some master's programs offered by the TUM School of Management.

The information whether this option is valid for a certain degree program and, if so, how many credits you need to have completed in English modules, can be found in the Academic and Examination Regulations of a degree program.\nIf this option is given for a certain degree program, you need to submit your transcript of records or your degree certificate as evidence, as well as the form for verification of English-language proficiency through English-language modules in the undergraduate degree program (PDF, 175 KB).\nFor some Master’s degree programs, for example at the TUM School of Computation, Information and Technology, it is also possible to prove your English-language proficiency by submitting an English-language Bachelor’s thesis. Please note that the thesis must already have been submitted and graded. The English title must be noted in the transcript as a passed credit requirement and the transcript must indicate that the thesis was written in English; otherwise, a separate certificate from the university stating the language of the bachelor's thesis must be submitted. If the Bachelor’s thesis has not yet been graded, it cannot be used as a proof of English language proficiency.\nSemesters spent in an exchange program or internship are not sufficient.\n[CARD]\nIn the Bachelor’s degree programs Aerospace Information Engineering Management and Data Science Management and Technology (at Munich Campus) Political Science Sustainable Management and Technology English language skills verification is carried out as part of the aptitude assessment.\nIn this process, it is assessed whether the language skills you have acquired at school are sufficient for your studies.

Alternatively, the necessary language skills can be verified during the aptitude interview\nThe regulations for your degree program can be found in the corresponding Regulations on Aptitude Assessment.\n[CARD]\nA GMAT with a score higher than 600 is accepted as proof of english skills for some master's programs offered by the TUM School of Management.

      "content": "Admission to degree programs at TUM is handled in several different ways. This page provides an overview of the admission procedures.\nBe sure to inform yourself about the details of the procedure for a specific program in the academic and examination regulations or the regulations on the aptitude assessment or aptitude recommendation.\nApplicants will be granted admission to a program with unrestricted admission when\nCertain programs require that an internship be completed before the start of studies. When applying for a Master's program, the applicant's Bachelor's degree will be checked to confirm that it is accredited. This is especially true if the applicant is transferring from another university.\nUnrestricted degree programs\nFirst, the applicant’s grade point average and subject-specific grades will be evaluated using a point system. Which grades are evaluated and how they are weighted depends on the applicant’s chosen degree program. Each program has a set of statutes that define the formula to be used. Depending on the degree program and the amount of points accumulated, applicants are either immediately admitted or invited to an admissions interview or written test carried out by the school. The interview or test helps determine if the applicant is capable of successfully completing the desired degree program. For certain programs, the interview or written test is also intended to determine whether the necessary language requirements are met. For some programs, applicants below a certain point threshold may be rejected without an interview or written test.\nPlease note: In contrast to the Numerus Clausus programs, the number of spots available (capacity limit) is not fixed. We accept all applicants we feel are qualified. As such, no lotteries will be held after final selections have been made, and there will be no list of alternatives for unsuccessful applicants to claim unwanted spots.\nDegree programs subject to aptitude assessment\nOur Aptitude recommendation supports students in choosing the degree program best suited to their interests and abilities.\nFirst, the applicant’s grade point average and subject-specific grades will be evaluated using a point system. Which grades are evaluated and how they are weighted depends on the applicant’s chosen degree program. Each program has a set of statues that defines the formula to be used. Depending on the amount of points accumulated, applicants are either immediately admitted or invited to a  mandatory, 20 minute interview carried out by the school. The interview helps determine if the applicant is capable of successfully completing the desired course of study. There is no written test.\nThe result of the interview determines whether the applicant receives a recommendation for the degree program. The purpose of the recommendation is to help students select the right program – it is, however, no mandatory requirement for admission.\nNC degree programs have a fixed number of spots available, awarded primarily based on the applicant's grade point average and the amount of time the student has been waiting for a spot. This amount of time is defined as the number of semesters that have elapsed since completion of secondary studies and in which the applicant has not been admitted to a German university. Periods in which the applicant audited classes or studied abroad also count as waiting time. Applicants who are not admitted are automatically put on an alternatives list. These students may be admitted at a later date in the event a spot is not accepted by another student.\nNC program eligibility will be based solely on the results of the past years. The grade point average of the last person to have been admitted constitutes the current NC standard. Since the number of applicants and their criteria (grades, waiting time, etc.) are unpredictable, it is still possible to apply with a lower grade point average than the current NC grades.\nDegree programs with restricted admission\nPlease note: The application and admission for NC programs is coordinated via the dialogue-oriented service procedure.\nIn the initial stage of this procedure, the grades you obtained during your Bachelor’s program, as well as your written documents, will be evaluated using a point system.\nFor some degree programs, the first stage of the aptitude assessment differs for applicants who have obtained their Bachelor’s degree in a country outside the scope of the “Lisbon Convention”: They have to take an online test. You can find out whether this applies to your desired degree program on the respective program page in the section “How do I apply?”.\nDepending on the number of points accumulated, applicants are either immediately admitted, rejected, or invited to a 20 minute admissions interview carried out by the school. In some cases interviews by telephone or video for international students are common. The interview helps determine if the applicant is capable of successfully completing the desired course of study. For some programs offered by the TUM School of Engineering and Design and the TUM School of Management a written test or the assessment of your academic qualification and your essay replace the interview.\nLecture period, lecture-free days, or enrollment periods – all semester dates and deadlines at a glance.\n+49 89 289 22245  Monday to Friday, 9:00 a.m. – 12:00 p.m.   studiumspam prevention@tum.de Please observe the e-mail etiquette.\nFind all the info on our services here.\nPersonal advising sessions with General Student Advising by appointment.\nCampus Munich, Arcisstraße 21, Room 0144, 80333 München\nMonday, Wednesday, Friday: 9 a.m. – 12 p.m.\nTuesday and Thursday, 1 p.m. – 4 p.m. (Student Information only)\n• Show convenient version of this site\n• Don't show this message again\n• Unrestricted degree programs\n• Aptitude assessment for Bachelor’s degree programs\n• Aptitude recommendation (SOV) for Bachelor’s degree applicants\n• Restricted degree programs (Numerus Clausus, NC)\n• Aptitude assessment for Master’s degree applicants\n• the online application was submitted in time and complete with all required documents,\n• and your documents have been reviewed.\n[CARD]\nDates and Deadlines\nDates and Deadlines\n\n\nLecture period, lecture-free days, or enrollment periods – all semester dates and deadlines at a glance.\n[CARD]\nDates and Deadlines\nDates and Deadlines\n[CARD]\nDates and Deadlines\n[CARD]\nLecture period, lecture-free days, or enrollment periods – all semester dates and deadlines at a glance.\n[CARD]\nStudent Advising and Information Services\nStudent Advising and Information Services\n\n\n +49 89 289 22245  Monday to Friday, 9:00 a.m. – 12:00 p.m.   studiumspam prevention@tum.de Please observe the e-mail etiquette.\nFind all the info on our services here.\nPersonal advising sessions with General Student Advising by appointment.\n[CARD]\nStudent Advising and Information Services\nStudent Advising and Information Services\n[CARD]\nStudent Advising and Information Services\n[CARD]\n+49 89 289 22245  Monday to Friday, 9:00 a.m. – 12:00 p.m.   studiumspam prevention@tum.de Please observe the e-mail etiquette.\nFind all the info on our services here.\nPersonal advising sessions with General Student Advising by appointment.\n[CARD]\nService Desk\nService Desk\n\n\n Campus Munich, Arcisstraße 21, Room 0144, 80333 München\nMonday, Wednesday, Friday: 9 a.m. – 12 p.m.\nTuesday and Thursday, 1 p.m. – 4 p.m. (Student Information only)\n[CARD]\nService Desk\nService Desk\n[CARD]\nService Desk\n[CARD]\nCampus Munich, Arcisstraße 21, Room 0144, 80333 München\nMonday, Wednesday, Friday: 9 a.m. – 12 p.m.\nTuesday and Thursday, 1 p.m. – 4 p.m. (Student Information only)",
