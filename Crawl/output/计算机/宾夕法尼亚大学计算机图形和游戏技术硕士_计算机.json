Creating such computer-generated imagery, however, is no trivial task. It requires a delicate blending of art with science by teams of highly skilled professionals, including artists, animators, writers, designers, engineers and software developers working long hours with cutting-edge technology and tools. Currently there are very few interdisciplinary academic programs at four-year research universities adequately preparing students for such positions. The Master of Science in Engineering in Computer Graphics and Game Technology (CGGT) was created specifically to address this need.\nThe CGGT program was established in 2004. The goal of the program is to expose recent graduates, as well as individuals returning from industry, to state-of-the-art graphics and animation technologies, as well as interactive media design principles, product development methodologies and engineering entrepreneurship. The CGGT program prepares students for positions requiring multidisciplinary skills such as designers, technical animators, technical directors and game programmers. Students in the CGGT program use the equipment and resources available through the SIG Center for Computer Graphics. Opportunities for specialization are provided in such core areas as art and animation, creative design, animation and simulation technology, human/computer interfaces and production management.\nStudents seeking admission to the program are assumed to have a bachelor’s degree in either Computer Science or Engineering. Students seeking admission with non-computer science and/or engineering undergraduate backgrounds will require a minimum of two years to complete the program. The first year will be spent in the Department’s Master of Computer and Information Technology (MCIT) program; upon satisfactory completion of the MCIT program, the student may pursue the Computer Graphics and Game Technology degree. Such students, having taken a total of 16 courses, will receive two degrees: a Master of Computer and Information Technology and a Master of Science and Engineering in Computer Graphics and Game Technology.\nTo learn more about the application and admission requirements please visit:\nVisit the Graduate Admissions website for additional FAQs.\nSince 1975, the Center for Human Modeling and Simulation (HMS) has been a leader in the fields of 3D computer graphics, human simulation and the behavioral animation of embodied intelligent agents. The lab has achieved international recognition for its research and is well known for the “Jack” software, a procedural character animation system used in both private sector and government applications. Computer Graphics Penn alumni have been influential in computer graphics applications around the world, and include industry leaders such as Nick Foster of PDI/DreamWorks (“Shrek”) and Cary Philips at Industrial Light and Magic (ILM), who are winners of Academy Awards for Technical Achievement.\nThe SIG Center for Computer Graphics includes a state-of-the-art motion capture studio, high performance NVidia GPU processors and Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality systems (Vive, Oculus and Hololens). This lab houses both the HMS Center and ViDi, the Digital Visualization Center. It fosters a collegial and open atmosphere in which faculty, staff, and students interact and collaborate. Doctoral students are often teamed with CGGT students and students from the affiliated undergraduate Digital Media Design (DMD) program to conduct cutting-edge research and produce animated demonstrations highlighting their results. The continued industry need for well-rounded designers, programmers and technical directors who understand both the art and science of producing visual media and interactive content has led to great success with graduates from both the CGGT and DMD programs finding employment at companies such as Pixar, DreamWorks, Disney, Electronic Arts, Microsoft, Sony, Activision, Blue Sky Entertainment.\nSince this is a specialized, one-year graduate-level master’s program, students seeking admission to the CGGT program are assumed to already have a bachelor’s degree in either Computer Science or Engineering. Candidates with at least two years of course work at the undergraduate level in Computer Science and/or Engineering at a four year University also will be considered for admission to the program.\nStudents seeking admission with non-computer science and/or engineering undergraduate backgrounds will require a minimum of two years to complete the program. The first year will be spent in the CIS Department’s Master’s in Computer and Information Technology (MCIT) program; upon satisfactory completion of the MCIT program, the student may pursue the Computer Graphics and Game Technology program. Such students, having taken a total of 16 courses, will receive two degrees: a Master of Computer and Information Technology and a Master of Science in Engineering in Computer Graphics and Game Technology.\nClick here to access the MCIT to CGGT transition form.\nStudents who are sub-matriculating from the Penn undergraduate DMD program will have, more than likely, already taken many of the required courses, such as Computer Graphics (CIS460/CIS560), Computer Animation (CIS462/CIS562), Game Design (CIS564), 3D Modeling (FNAR635), Animation (FNAR567), Visual Communication (COMM564), etc. In situations where students have already taken the required course choices in a Core Area, additional course selections will be needed, subject to the approval of the CGGT Program Director.

      "content": "[HEADING] Accelerated Master's Programs in Engineering\n[HEADING] Admissions\n[HEADING] Academic Policies\nThe Accelerated Master’s (AM) Program provides qualified students with the opportunity to begin working on a master’s degree while completing their bachelor’s degree. Students can take graduate level courses along with their undergraduate courses as their schedule permits.\nWe strongly recommend students review their course plan with their undergraduate advisor(s) – both faculty and academic – as they become interested in the AM Program and before submitting the application. This will help immensely with the curriculum planning process. Applicants should apply during their sophomore or junior year. Students may submit an application as early as their third semester in the undergraduate degree. For application procedures, deadlines, and eligibility, visit Accelerated Master’s Programs Admissions.\nCredits and Double Counting Courses\nStudents may double count up to three course units (CUs) of graduate courses to fulfill both undergraduate and graduate degree requirements. This is subject to approval by program chairs/directors.\n50% Rule: Students admitted in the AM program should make sure 50% or more of their enrolled course units (CUs) in a term satisfy requirements for the undergraduate degree. At no time should a student be taking more than four graduate level CUs (5000+ level) in a single term.\nStudents may apply a maximum of three course units (CUs) that were taken prior to matriculation in the AM degree towards the master’s degree.\nAfter a student matriculates into the AM, they must only take classes at the 5000 level and above towards the master’s degree. No exceptions.\nEligibility\nCoursework Completion Requirements\nAll coursework counting toward the master’s degree must be completed at Penn. Transfer, study abroad, or ‘credit away’ courses are not permitted.\nQuestions? Contact the OAS Grad Advising team at grad-affairs@seas.upenn.edu.\n• Student Handbook\n• Programs + Options\n• Accelerated Masters in Engineering\n• If more than 50% of enrolled CUs in a term are graduate course units that satisfy requirements for the graduate degree only, the student is not eligible for undergraduate financial aid in that term. Students should plan carefully with their academic advisors to avoid this scenario.\n\nExample A: For 5 CUs, if 3 CUs are used for undergraduate (UG) requirements only and 2 CUs are for Master’s (Grad) requirements only, this follows the 50% Rule.\nExample B: For 6 CUs, if 2 CUs are used for UG requirements only, 3 CUs are used for Grad requirements only, and 1 CU is double counted between UG and Grad, this follows the 50% Rule.\nExample C: For 5 CUs, if 1 CU is used for UG requirements only, 3 CUs are for Grad requirements only, and 1 CU is double counted between UG and Grad, this does NOT follow the 50% Rule.\n• Example A: For 5 CUs, if 3 CUs are used for undergraduate (UG) requirements only and 2 CUs are for Master’s (Grad) requirements only, this follows the 50% Rule.\n• Example B: For 6 CUs, if 2 CUs are used for UG requirements only, 3 CUs are used for Grad requirements only, and 1 CU is double counted between UG and Grad, this follows the 50% Rule.\n• Example C: For 5 CUs, if 1 CU is used for UG requirements only, 3 CUs are for Grad requirements only, and 1 CU is double counted between UG and Grad, this does NOT follow the 50% Rule.\n• Example A: For 5 CUs, if 3 CUs are used for undergraduate (UG) requirements only and 2 CUs are for Master’s (Grad) requirements only, this follows the 50% Rule.\n• Example B: For 6 CUs, if 2 CUs are used for UG requirements only, 3 CUs are used for Grad requirements only, and 1 CU is double counted between UG and Grad, this follows the 50% Rule.\n• Example C: For 5 CUs, if 1 CU is used for UG requirements only, 3 CUs are for Grad requirements only, and 1 CU is double counted between UG and Grad, this does NOT follow the 50% Rule.\n• The three graduate level courses taken prior to matriculation into the AM must be double counted.\n• Cross-listed courses taken at the 4000 level prior to matriculation into the AM may be used for the graduate degree if the course content is identical to the 5000+ level course and is cross-listed in the term it was taken.\n\nNote that any course lower than 4000 level may not be used towards the graduate degree.\n• Note that any course lower than 4000 level may not be used towards the graduate degree.\n• Note that any course lower than 4000 level may not be used towards the graduate degree.\n• No course may be triple counted, i.e., counted for more than two credentials. For example, if a course is counted towards two undergraduate degrees, it cannot be counted towards a graduate degree as well. Certificates are considered credentials so these courses also cannot be triple counted. Minors are not considered a credential and do not factor into triple counting. One course could be counted towards a minor, undergraduate degree and graduate degree, for example.\n• Students will have their graduate level courses reflected on the master’s transcript during the term taken. The Office of Academic Services (OAS) Registrar Team will contact students each term regarding this. Upon matriculation into the AM program, students will be contacted to collect any of their double-counted courses (3 CUs) taken prior to the current term. Once a course is finalized, it cannot be altered on the transcript.\n• Engineering recognizes matriculation into one Accelerated Master’s program across the schools; there are no dual-degree AM programs. An AM student may enroll in a graduate certificate, but would need to be careful to avoid triple-counting.\n• A minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0 is required. (BIOT requires a cumulative GPA of 3.5, CIS requires a cumulative GPA of 3.2, and ROBO requires a minimum STEM GPA of 3.2.)\n• Both BSE and BAS degree students in Penn Engineering may apply for the Accelerated Master’s program. Qualified undergraduates in Penn’s other schools may apply for an Accelerated Master’s into any of the Engineering Master’s degree programs, subject to their home school’s rules and regulations.\n• Uncoordinated dual degree students are not eligible for the Accelerated Master’s degree.\n• If a student is unable to apply for the AM while the student is an undergraduate, the student can still apply for a Penn master’s program through the standard admissions process as an external applicant following application rules and requirements. If admitted, the student must complete ten graduate level CUs, as double counting rules will not apply.\n• Penn Engineering Online does not allow matriculation into their programs through Accelerated Master’s. Interested students must apply externally to start after completion of the undergraduate degree.\n• For single undergraduate degree students, the undergraduate degree must be completed in eight (8) semesters, or the student will not be eligible to continue with the Accelerated Master’s degree.\n• Students pursuing a coordinated dual degree (e.g., M&T, VIPER) program must complete their Engineering Undergraduate degree in ten (10) semesters.\n\nWhile there is no penalty for completing your undergraduate degree sooner, students are not allowed to overload (7/7.5 CUs) to accomplish this.\n• While there is no penalty for completing your undergraduate degree sooner, students are not allowed to overload (7/7.5 CUs) to accomplish this.\n• If a student is terminated from the AM, they will lose the privilege to double count courses between the undergraduate and graduate degrees and must apply to the master’s program externally, submitting all relevant application materials.\n• While there is no penalty for completing your undergraduate degree sooner, students are not allowed to overload (7/7.5 CUs) to accomplish this.",

Here are some of the questions we hear most often. For additional information, please connect with us.\nIf you are admitted to a graduate program, we will email you instructions for beginning the I-20 application process. If you have questions about the I-20 process, please contact the University’s International Student and Scholar Services office.\nMaster’s students may request a transfer of up to two graduate-level courses, and doctoral students may request transfer of up to nine. We do not accept transfer credits from online courses for on-campus programs. Read more about transfer credit in the Graduate Student Handbook.\nYes. Start by submitting an application for the first program you are applying to, and then submit your other application(s) using the same account and login information. You will need to upload all the required application components and pay a separate application fee for each application you submit.\nIf you are admitted to more than one program, you may enroll in only one. You can apply to the second program (as a dual degree option) after you have completed at least one semester. See the Graduate Student Handbook for details.\nNo, but we do have some recommendations. For more, see How to Apply.\nSome of our programs require a BS in engineering, but others don’t. You can learn more about prerequisites in the descriptions of our master’s programs and Ph.D. programs.\nThat depends on the program, but in general, you must have a bachelor’s degree from an accredited college or university by the time classes begin. For details, see How to Apply.\nNo. Once you have submitted your application, it is considered final. We understand that you may want to share updated grades or achievements, but all applications are evaluated on the basis of the materials submitted at the time of submission.\nWe do not discuss application results with prospective students. You cannot apply to the same program for the same term if you have already received a decision, but you can apply for a later term.\nYes, you can defer for up to one academic year. To request a deferral, first accept the offer of admission and (if you are a master’s candidate) pay the tuition deposit. You can find a Deferral Request Form in your application portal.\nYour request must be approved by the program that offered you admission. Please allow up to one week for your deferral request to be reviewed.\nYou will be notified by email that a decision is available to be viewed online. You will need to log into your application to view the actual decision, and you won’t receive a letter by mail.\nOnce you have submitted your application, you will have access to your application checklist. From your checklist, you can review the status of your application and can edit or send reminders to your recommendation writers.\nIf all materials have been received, you can assume your application is complete and under review. You will receive an email notification when your decision is available.\nOur Career Services team offers a wealth of career resources, including on-campus recruiting and one-on-one advising related to career planning, job hunting, interviews and more.\nYes. The University of Pennsylvania has its very own campus police force, and the Philadelphia Police also patrol in and around campus. Shuttles and other services are available to make sure you’re safe as you travel around campus at night. See our Public Safety website for more.\nYes! Penn Engineering has several student organizations designed specifically for graduate students, and so does the University at large. In addition, the Graduate Student Center is a terrific resource for the entire Graduate Student population at Penn.\nPenn has a limited amount of on-campus housing for graduate students. If you choose to live off campus, Penn Off Campus Services can help you find the right place.\nGenerally speaking, you don’t need to contact Penn faculty prior to applying for your program; however, doctoral applicants may choose to do so to identify a principal investigator for research. Otherwise, if you have questions about the program, courses, or research, you are welcome to reach out to your department of interest.\nYes, we encourage prospective students to contact the specific department you are interested in for more information.\nYes! Our Engineering Master’s Advisory Board (EMAB) is made up of students who are happy to answer your questions. Contact a student ambassador in your department of interest.\nThe application system automatically sends an email to each recommender once you’ve entered their names and email addresses. If they haven’t received an email, it’s possible that you entered their information incorrectly or that the email ended up in their junk mail folder. You can log into your application or review your application checklist to re-notify your recommender.\nOur students go on to a wide variety of rewarding careers in academia, engineering and beyond. In one recent year, 93.3% of our master’s degree graduates were either employed, continuing their education, volunteering, serving in the military or not seeking a new position in the first six months after graduation. Learn more about our alumni by visiting the Penn Engineering Alumni Society website.\nWe don’t offer a nondegree enrollment option on campus, but we encourage you to explore our open online courses taught by Penn Engineering faculty in partnership with Coursera and edX.\nNo, Ph.D. students do not automatically receive master’s degrees. But you’re welcome to speak to your department about coordinating your Ph.D. coursework with master’s requirements so that you can get that degree as well.\nYes, but you need to submit an application, and admission is not guaranteed. Start by talking to faculty and staff of the Ph.D. program that interests you.\nYes. After your first semester, you may apply to transfer into another engineering master’s program. But you can’t transfer between on-campus programs and online programs. The Graduate Handbook has more information about transferring between programs and dual degree options.\nNo. Courses take place during weekdays, with the latest courses typically beginning at 4:30 p.m. Some of our programs allow you to take courses at other schools within the University, and those courses may have later start times.\nThat depends on your work schedule. Most of our courses are offered during the day, with the latest beginning at 4:30 p.m.\nYes, depending on the flexibility of your schedule and the requirements of your program. Once you have been admitted, you can discuss this with your program coordinator. International students are not eligible for part-time enrollment except in online programs.\nNo, our master’s programs do not require a thesis. Most of our programs allow students to complete their program either completely through coursework or with two to three credits’ worth of research toward a thesis or an independent study.\nAll of our master’s programs require 10 course units, except for Biotechnology, which requires 11. While most of our courses are 1 course unit, a small number are .5, so you will probably take 10 to 12 courses for your degree.\nOur programs can generally be completed in one to two years, depending on how many courses you take each semester. Visit the Program Page for your program of interest to learn more about course requirements and planning.\nAll documentation is submitted online through the application. If you receive and accept an offer of admission, you’ll receive further instructions on how to send the required official, final transcripts and certificates of graduation from your university or college.\nDue to the volume of applications we receive, please allow up to seven business days after submission for all materials to link to your application. You can monitor the status of your application and materials in the online Application Portal.\nYour scores need to be two years old or less. If you took the exam more than two years ago, you will need to retake it.\nWe waive the English-language requirement under certain circumstances. Please see How to Apply for details.\nWe evaluate applications as a whole portfolio, not on a single criterion, and we don’t require a minimum GRE score (or a GRE score at all).\nYour scores must be five years old or less. If you took the GRE more than five years ago, you’ll need to retake the exam if you want to submit GRE scores.\nNo – the GRE is optional for all of our graduate programs. But you’re welcome to submit your scores if you’ve taken the GRE within the past five years. Please have the official test scores submitted by the testing service to us at institution code 2888 and use the department code that best matches your program department.\nYou’ll receive full funding if you’re a doctoral student. A limited number of RA and TA positions are available to master’s students. You may also be able to find a part-time lab position through your academic department; please note that these opportunities are limited and not guaranteed. You can also explore scholarship opportunities, student employment or federal funding (if you’re a U.S. citizen or permanent resident).\nYou’re welcome to apply for part-time jobs on campus, but there is no formal association between an on-campus job and tuition.

The MCIT program stems from a belief that advanced computer science coursework for people with undergraduate degrees in other diverse fields leads to highly successful career paths. Our graduates and their careers today stand as strong proof to this philosophy. Within the realm of academia, pursuing further advanced study in computer science is also an option open to MCIT graduates.\nDue to the goals and nature of the MCIT program, it is strictly for applicants with limited or no past experience in computer science. Candidates with an undergraduate major in Computer Science or closely related fields, should consider applying to the Master of Science in Engineering (MSE) program instead.\nTo learn more about the application and admission requirements please visit:\nVisit the Graduate Admissions website for additional FAQs.\nOur students come from backgrounds as diverse as chemistry, history, medicine, law, mathematics, literature and fine arts. However, what they all share in common is immense drive and a strong desire to succeed in the field of computing and technology. With their unique combination of skills in Computer Science and non-Computer Science fields, they have gone on to succeed in both technical and interdisciplinary careers. Moreover, current students are very well connected with our tight-knit alumni community, and the MCIT network is growing with each graduating batch.\nMCIT graduates emerge from the program as well-rounded and versatile individuals, and find themselves in a prime position in the job market. Past students have gone on to work in various roles at large companies like Google, Microsoft and Facebook, as well as at entrepreneurial start-ups and smaller-sized companies across the nation. Moreover, with their diverse backgrounds, our students are also in a unique position to fill technical jobs in industries such as bioinformatics, medicine, finance, telecommunications, media and many others. A significant proportion of our students do internships in the summer between their first and second years of study, and these internships often lead to full-time employment offers. Our accessible and tight-knit alumni network, together with Penn’s stellar Career Services and our supportive, reputed faculty, ensure that MCIT graduates are exposed to the many doors that are open to them after graduation.\nThe MCIT program is intended for bright, motivated students who have little or no background in Computer Science and who are looking to start a rewarding, successful career in computing and technology or pursue further education in this field.\nThe MCIT program is intended for students without backgrounds in Computer Science or related fields, and expects no prior experience in programming or developing software. Those with undergraduate degrees in Computer Science or related fields, or who have programming experience beyond the introductory level, should consider our department’s MSE programs instead.\nMCIT students are required to take a core curriculum of six courses that are designed to provide a solid foundation in Computer Science in the first year. Each student then takes his/her choice of four advanced electives.\nThe six required courses fall into three distinct categories:\nSoftware Development, Data Structures and Algorithms:\nMathematical Foundations, Algorithmic Analysis and Theory of Computation:\nComputer Architecture and Systems Programming:\nThese six core classes are offered exclusively to MCIT students, and often serve as a common bonding ground. These courses are followed by four advanced computer science electives of the student’s choosing. A wide variety of electives are offered every year, and each student can tailor their choice of subjects according to their interest.\nIn total the MCIT degree requires the completion of 10 courses. The degree is usually completed in three or four semesters.\nWe do not offer transfer credits for the MCIT on-campus program. Students who feel that they are already knowledgeable in a required course can request a waiver for that course, which will be granted subject to that particular course’s instructor approval. Note that waived courses do not reduce the overall number of courses required for the degree. Students are allowed to waive at most 2 courses.\nYes, we have a number of part-time students, typically taking one to two courses a semester. However, note that all MCIT courses are regular graduate-level courses that are scheduled during the academic term.\nNo. The first year MCIT curriculum is designed to be a continuous one year program, with classes taught in the spring building upon material taught in the fall. Due to this sequence of course offerings, candidates cannot start in the spring semester.\nOur admissions process is a rigorous one, and we strongly believe that if admitted, you have the full potential to succeed both in the program and beyond. The MCIT program has had outstanding graduation rates, and our students are often surprised by their own technical abilities and transformation after the program.

The MCIT program stems from a belief that advanced computer science coursework for people with undergraduate degrees in other diverse fields leads to highly successful career paths. Our graduates and their careers today stand as strong proof to this philosophy. Within the realm of academia, pursuing further advanced study in computer science is also an option open to MCIT graduates.\nDue to the goals and nature of the MCIT program, it is strictly for applicants with limited or no past experience in computer science. Candidates with an undergraduate major in Computer Science or closely related fields, should consider applying to the Master of Science in Engineering (MSE) program instead.\n \nTo learn more about the application and admission requirements please visit:\nHow Do I Apply?\n\nVisit the Graduate Admissions website for additional FAQs.\n\nDegree Requirements\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Students\nOur students come from backgrounds as diverse as chemistry, history, medicine, law, mathematics, literature and fine arts. However, what they all share in common is immense drive and a strong desire to succeed in the field of computing and technology. With their unique combination of skills in Computer Science and non-Computer Science fields, they have gone on to succeed in both technical and interdisciplinary careers. Moreover, current students are very well connected with our tight-knit alumni community, and the MCIT network is growing with each graduating batch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Should I Expect After Graduation?\nMCIT graduates emerge from the program as well-rounded and versatile individuals, and find themselves in a prime position in the job market. Past students have gone on to work in various roles at large companies like Google, Microsoft and Facebook, as well as at entrepreneurial start-ups and smaller-sized companies across the nation. Moreover, with their diverse backgrounds, our students are also in a unique position to fill technical jobs in industries such as bioinformatics, medicine, finance, telecommunications, media and many others. A significant proportion of our students do internships in the summer between their first and second years of study, and these internships often lead to full-time employment offers. Our accessible and tight-knit alumni network, together with Penn’s stellar Career Services and our supportive, reputed faculty, ensure that MCIT graduates are exposed to the many doors that are open to them after graduation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgram FAQ\n\n\n\nWho should apply to the MCIT program?\n\n\n\n\nThe MCIT program is intended for bright, motivated students who have little or no background in Computer Science and who are looking to start a rewarding, successful career in computing and technology or pursue further education in this field.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if I have an undergraduate degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, etc.? Or prior software development experience? Should I apply anyway?\n\n\n\n\nThe MCIT program is intended for students without backgrounds in Computer Science or related fields, and expects no prior experience in programming or developing software. Those with undergraduate degrees in Computer Science or related fields, or who have programming experience beyond the introductory level, should consider our department’s MSE programs instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat will I study?\n\n\n\n\n\nMCIT students are required to take a core curriculum of six courses that are designed to provide a solid foundation in Computer Science in the first year. Each student then takes his/her choice of four advanced electives.\nThe six required courses fall into three distinct categories:\nSoftware Development, Data Structures and Algorithms:\n\nCIT-5910: This course covers introductory programming and provides students with knowledge of software development tools and techniques.\nCIT-5940: This course builds upon CIT-5910 and covers advanced programming techniques, data structures and algorithms.\n\nMathematical Foundations, Algorithmic Analysis and Theory of Computation:\n\nCIT-5920: This course provides an introduction to discrete math – a crucial cornerstone to understanding the thinking behind various advances in modern computer science.\nCIT-5960: This course builds upon CIT-5920, and uses mathematical techniques and the theoretical foundations of computation to introduce students to more advanced algorithms and algorithmic thinking.\n\nComputer Architecture and Systems Programming:\n\nCIT-5930: This course teaches students about the inner workings of a computer, starting from transistors and building up towards modern computer architecture. It demystifies the boundary between hardware and software and teaches MCIT students what really goes on within a computer.\nCIT-5950: This course builds upon CIT-593, and shows students how they can use their knowledge of underlying computer architecture to design software systems. It equips students with the tools required to write programs for various devices in networked environments.\n\nThese six core classes are offered exclusively to MCIT students, and often serve as a common bonding ground. These courses are followed by four advanced computer science electives of the student’s choosing. A wide variety of electives are offered every year, and each student can tailor their choice of subjects according to their interest.\nIn total the MCIT degree requires the completion of 10 courses. The degree is usually completed in three or four semesters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the policy regarding course transfers and waivers?\n\n\n\n\nWe do not offer transfer credits for the MCIT on-campus program. Students who feel that they are already knowledgeable in a required course can request a waiver for that course, which will be granted subject to that particular course’s instructor approval. Note that waived courses do not reduce the overall number of courses required for the degree. Students are allowed to waive at most 2 courses.\n\n\n\n\n\nCan I be a part-time student?\n\n\n\n\nYes, we have a number of part-time students, typically taking one to two courses a semester. However, note that all MCIT courses are regular graduate-level courses that are scheduled during the academic term.\n\n\n\n\n\nCan I start in the spring semester?\n\n\n\n\nNo. The first year MCIT curriculum is designed to be a continuous one year program, with classes taught in the spring building upon material taught in the fall. Due to this sequence of course offerings, candidates cannot start in the spring semester.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow likely am I to succeed in this new field?\n\n\n\n\nOur admissions process is a rigorous one, and we strongly believe that if admitted, you have the full potential to succeed both in the program and beyond. The MCIT program has had outstanding graduation rates, and our students are often surprised by their own technical abilities and transformation after the program. Moreover, MCIT students have a vast array of resources to help them succeed. Our faculty are very invested in the success of this group of students, and their support, together with the MCIT program’s strong alumni connections and a devoted Career Services department, ensure that MCIT students are primed to succeed even if the tech industry is new to them.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the application process like?\n\n\n\n\nMCIT applications are handled by the same system that handles applications for other CIS graduate programs.

Research and teaching form the essence of our doctoral program. Our curriculum is designed to develop the intellectual skills essential for the rapidly changing character of research and to meet the demands of academe and industry. Students develop their own advanced study focus, working with faculty mentors on topics ranging from the core computer science discipline to diverse scholarly interactions within Penn Engineering and the University.\nThe Master of Science in Engineering in Computer and Information Science degree program is designed to allow flexible planning of advanced study. The MSE student develops their own advanced study focus, and can arrange interdisciplinary programs in such areas as CIS and Telecommunications, CIS and Computational Linguistics, CIS and Biomedical Computation, etc. Graduate studies in the Department offer the possibility for rewarding exploration and research. This is a uniquely exciting place to be.\nThe Master of Computer and Information Technology (MCIT) program is for applicants whose undergraduate degree is not in computer science. Candidates with an undergraduate major in computer science should consider applying instead to the Master of Science in Engineering (MSE) program. The MCIT program stems from a belief that advanced computer science coursework for people with degrees in other fields leads to highly successful career paths. This innovative program allows those with no computing experience to begin an IT career, those who are experienced in IT to advance, and it prepares students for future advanced study in computer science. Students can enroll either full- or part-time.\nNote: Information on this site is for the on-campus program. Students interested in the online MCIT program should visit this site.\nPenn’s Master of Science in Engineering (MSE) in Data Science prepares students for a wide range of data-centric careers, whether in technology and engineering, consulting, science, policy-making, or understanding patterns in literature, art or communications.\nThe Data Science Program can typically be completed in one-and-a-half to two years. It blends leading-edge courses in core topics such as machine learning, big data analytics, and statistics, with a variety of electives and an opportunity to apply these techniques in a domain specialization – a depth area – of choice.\nA traditional embedded system is an integrated system consisting of hardware and software. In the more contemporary view, an embedded system, sometimes also called a cyber-physical system, consists of a collection of computing devices communicating with one another and interacting with the physical world via sensors and actuators in a feedback loop. Increasingly, such systems are everywhere, from smart buildings to medical devices to automobiles. Skills needed to develop such systems lie at the intersection of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering. The Master of Science in Engineering in Embedded Systems (EMBS) is offered jointly by the Departments of Computer and Information Science and Electrical and Systems Engineering within the School of Engineering and Applied Science. This innovative and unique degree program will train students in the fundamentals of design and implementation of cyber-physical systems.\nThe modern expert in robotics and intelligent systems must be proficient in artificial intelligence, computer vision, control systems, dynamics, machine learning, as well as the design, programming, and prototyping of robotic systems. Such subjects typically reside in different departments, and departmental programs do not offer the flexibility for cross-departmental training. The Master of Science In Engineering (MSE) program in Robotics offers a more balanced and flexible academic curriculum that cuts across multiple departments.\nInteractive entertainment and computer-animated visual effects are now part of our mainstream culture. Creating such computer-generated imagery, however, is no trivial task. It requires a delicate blending of art with science by teams of highly skilled professionals, including artists, animators, writers, designers, engineers and software developers working long hours with cutting-edge technology and tools. Currently there are very few academic programs at four-year research universities adequately preparing students for such positions. The Master of Science in Engineering in Computer Graphics and Game Technology (CGGT) was created specifically to address this need.\nProgram Offerings\n\nDoctoral Program\nMSE in CIS\nMaster of Computer and Information Technology\nMSE in Data Science\nMSE in Robotics\nMSE in Computer Graphics and Game Technology\n\n\nHow to Apply\n\nAdmissions Statistics\n\n\nFellowships + Aid\nAdvising\n\nNew Students\nHow to Register\nHandbook\nForms\nTutoring\nGraduation + Thesis Information\nResources\n\n\nAcademic + Industry Job Postings\nRedian Furxhiu\nProgram Manager for on-campus Graduate MCIT, CIS/MSE and CGGT programs\nOffice: 308 Levine\nPhone: 215-898-1668\nEmail: redian@seas.upenn.edu\nStaci Kaplan\nProgram Manager for DATS (Data Science MSE)\nOffice: 308 Levine\nPhone: 215-573-2431\nEmail: stacilk@seas.upenn.edu\nBritton Carnevali\nDoctoral Program Manager\nOffice: 310 Levine\nPhone: 215-898-5515\nEmail: brittonc@cis.upenn.edu\nMariel Celentano\nGraduate Coordinator for ROBO\nOffice: 459 Levine\nPhone: 215-573-4907\nEmail: robo-coord@seas.upenn.edu\nJulia Esposito\nPICS Program Coordinator, SCMP Academic Coordinator\nOffice: 3401 Walnut, 5th Fl.\nPhone: 215-573-6037\nEmail: jnespos@seas.upenn.edu\n• Graduate\n• Program Offerings\n• Program Offerings\n\nDoctoral Program\nMSE in CIS\nMaster of Computer and Information Technology\nMSE in Data Science\nMSE in Robotics\nMSE in Computer Graphics and Game Technology\n• Doctoral Program\n• MSE in CIS\n• Master of Computer and Information Technology\n• MSE in Data Science\n• MSE in Robotics\n• MSE in Computer Graphics and Game Technology\n• How to Apply\n\nAdmissions Statistics\n• Admissions Statistics\n• Fellowships + Aid\n• Advising\n\nNew Students\nHow to Register\nHandbook\nForms\nTutoring\nGraduation + Thesis Information\nResources\n• New Students\n• How to Register\n• Handbook\n• Forms\n• Tutoring\n• Graduation + Thesis Information\n• Resources\n• Academic + Industry Job Postings\n• Doctoral Program\n• MSE in CIS\n• Master of Computer and Information Technology\n• MSE in Data Science\n• MSE in Robotics\n• MSE in Computer Graphics and Game Technology\n• Admissions Statistics\n• New Students\n• How to Register\n• Handbook\n• Forms\n• Tutoring\n• Graduation + Thesis Information\n• Resources\n[GRID_TABLE]\nProgram Offerings\nDoctoral Program (Ph.D.) in Computer and Information Science\nThe Doctoral Program in Computer and Information Science welcomes candidates with strong training in any of the disciplines related to modern information processing, with an emphasis on computer science and mathematics.

Research and teaching form the essence of our doctoral program. Our curriculum is designed to develop the intellectual skills essential for the rapidly changing character of research and to meet the demands of academe and industry. Students develop their own advanced study focus, working with faculty mentors on topics ranging from the core computer science discipline to diverse scholarly interactions within Penn Engineering and the University.\nLearn More\nMaster of Science in Engineering (MSE) in Computer and Information Science (CIS)\nThe Master of Science in Engineering in Computer and Information Science degree program is designed to allow flexible planning of advanced study. The MSE student develops their own advanced study focus, and can arrange interdisciplinary programs in such areas as CIS and Telecommunications, CIS and Computational Linguistics, CIS and Biomedical Computation, etc. Graduate studies in the Department offer the possibility for rewarding exploration and research. This is a uniquely exciting place to be.\nLearn More\nMaster of Computer and Information Technology (MCIT)\nThe Master of Computer and Information Technology (MCIT) program is for applicants whose undergraduate degree is not in computer science. Candidates with an undergraduate major in computer science should consider applying instead to the Master of Science in Engineering (MSE) program. The MCIT program stems from a belief that advanced computer science coursework for people with degrees in other fields leads to highly successful career paths. This innovative program allows those with no computing experience to begin an IT career, those who are experienced in IT to advance, and it prepares students for future advanced study in computer science. Students can enroll either full- or part-time.\nNote: Information on this site is for the on-campus program. Students interested in the online MCIT program should visit this site.\nLearn More\nMaster of Science in Engineering (MSE) in Data Science\nPenn’s Master of Science in Engineering (MSE) in Data Science prepares students for a wide range of data-centric careers, whether in technology and engineering, consulting, science, policy-making, or understanding patterns in literature, art or communications.\nThe Data Science Program can typically be completed in one-and-a-half to two years. It blends leading-edge courses in core topics such as machine learning, big data analytics, and statistics, with a variety of electives and an opportunity to apply these techniques in a domain specialization – a depth area – of choice.\nRead More\nMaster of Science in Engineering (MSE) in Embedded Systems (EMBS)\nA traditional embedded system is an integrated system consisting of hardware and software. In the more contemporary view, an embedded system, sometimes also called a cyber-physical system, consists of a collection of computing devices communicating with one another and interacting with the physical world via sensors and actuators in a feedback loop. Increasingly, such systems are everywhere, from smart buildings to medical devices to automobiles. Skills needed to develop such systems lie at the intersection of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering. The Master of Science in Engineering in Embedded Systems (EMBS) is offered jointly by the Departments of Computer and Information Science and Electrical and Systems Engineering within the School of Engineering and Applied Science. This innovative and unique degree program will train students in the fundamentals of design and implementation of cyber-physical systems.\nLearn More\nMaster of Science in Engineering (MSE) in Robotics (ROBO)\nThe modern expert in robotics and intelligent systems must be proficient in artificial intelligence, computer vision, control systems, dynamics, machine learning, as well as the design, programming, and prototyping of robotic systems. Such subjects typically reside in different departments, and departmental programs do not offer the flexibility for cross-departmental training. The Master of Science In Engineering (MSE) program in Robotics offers a more balanced and flexible academic curriculum that cuts across multiple departments.\nLearn More\nMaster of Science in Engineering (MSE) in Computer Graphics and Game Technology (CGGT)\nInteractive entertainment and computer-animated visual effects are now part of our mainstream culture. Creating such computer-generated imagery, however, is no trivial task. It requires a delicate blending of art with science by teams of highly skilled professionals, including artists, animators, writers, designers, engineers and software developers working long hours with cutting-edge technology and tools. Currently there are very few academic programs at four-year research universities adequately preparing students for such positions. The Master of Science in Engineering in Computer Graphics and Game Technology (CGGT) was created specifically to address this need.\nLearn More\n[GRID_TABLE]\nGraduate Program:\n\n\n\nProgram Offerings\n\nDoctoral Program\nMSE in CIS\nMaster of Computer and Information Technology\nMSE in Data Science\nMSE in Robotics\nMSE in Computer Graphics and Game Technology\n\n\nHow to Apply\n\nAdmissions Statistics\n\n\nFellowships + Aid\nAdvising\n\nNew Students\nHow to Register\nHandbook\nForms\nTutoring\nGraduation + Thesis Information\nResources\n\n\nAcademic + Industry Job Postings\n\nYour CIS Contacts:\nRedian Furxhiu\nProgram Manager for on-campus Graduate MCIT, CIS/MSE and CGGT programs\nOffice: 308 Levine\nPhone: 215-898-1668\nEmail: redian@seas.upenn.edu\nStaci Kaplan\nProgram Manager for DATS (Data Science MSE)\nOffice: 308 Levine\nPhone: 215-573-2431\nEmail: stacilk@seas.upenn.edu\nBritton Carnevali\nDoctoral Program Manager\nOffice: 310 Levine\nPhone: 215-898-5515\nEmail: brittonc@cis.upenn.edu \nMariel Celentano\nGraduate Coordinator for ROBO\nOffice: 459 Levine\nPhone: 215-573-4907\nEmail: robo-coord@seas.upenn.edu\nJulia Esposito\nPICS Program Coordinator, SCMP Academic Coordinator\nOffice: 3401 Walnut, 5th Fl.\nPhone: 215-573-6037\nEmail: jnespos@seas.upenn.edu\nProgram Offerings\n\nDoctoral Program\nMSE in CIS\nMaster of Computer and Information Technology\nMSE in Data Science\nMSE in Robotics\nMSE in Computer Graphics and Game Technology\nDoctoral Program\nMSE in CIS\nMaster of Computer and Information Technology\nMSE in Data Science\nMSE in Robotics\nMSE in Computer Graphics and Game Technology\nHow to Apply\n\nAdmissions Statistics\nAdmissions Statistics\nFellowships + Aid\nAdvising\n\nNew Students\nHow to Register\nHandbook\nForms\nTutoring\nGraduation + Thesis Information\nResources\nNew Students\nHow to Register\nHandbook\nTutoring\nGraduation + Thesis Information\nResources\nAcademic + Industry Job Postings\n[GRID_TABLE]\nProgram Offerings\n\nDoctoral Program\nMSE in CIS\nMaster of Computer and Information Technology\nMSE in Data Science\nMSE in Robotics\nMSE in Computer Graphics and Game Technology\nDoctoral Program\nMSE in CIS\nMaster of Computer and Information Technology\nMSE in Data Science\nMSE in Robotics\nMSE in Computer Graphics and Game Technology\nHow to Apply\n\nAdmissions Statistics\nAdmissions Statistics\nFellowships + Aid\nAdvising\n\nNew Students\nHow to Register\nHandbook\nForms\nTutoring\nGraduation + Thesis Information\nResources\nNew Students\nHow to Register\nHandbook\nTutoring\nGraduation + Thesis Information\nResources\nAcademic + Industry Job Postings",
