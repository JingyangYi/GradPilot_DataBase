Undocumented students who attended and graduated from a U.S. high school, with or without DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) status are not eligible for federal aid.\nLooking for estimated costs of attendance for graduate or professional degree programs? Please refer to the University Bursar’s Office Tuition Rates and Fees page to view current tuition rates for your program, as well as the table below for additional estimated costs of attendance used by your Financial Aid Office to determine your eligibility for student loan funding:\nEstimated Expense\nAnnual Amount\nBilled by Cornell*\nVaries by Degree Program\nMandatory Fees**\nSub-Total, Billed\nNot billed by Cornell*\nBooks & Course Materials\nTransportation\nPersonal Expenses\nSub-Total, Non-Billed\nTotal (Billed + Non-Billed)\nVaries by Degree Program\n* Expenses for housing, food, books, and other supplies may be billed or non-billed costs, depending on university housing plans and academic program.\n** Includes student activity fee ($110) and Cornell Health fee ($580).\nEstimated Expense\nAnnual Amount\nBilled by Cornell*\nVaries by Degree Program\nMandatory Fees**\nSub-Total, Billed\nNot billed by Cornell*\nBooks & Course Materials\nTransportation\nPersonal Expenses\nSub-Total, Non-Billed\nTotal (Billed + Non-Billed)\nVaries by Degree Program\n** Includes student activity fee ($110) and Cornell Health fee ($358).\nCornell University participates in two federal student loan programs (U.S. citizens and eligible non-citizens only), and certifies private education loan eligibility for graduate and professional degree candidates.\nThe Office of Financial Aid and Student Employment processes student loans for most Cornell graduate degree candidates. Student loans for professional degree candidates are processed by professional school financial aid offices (Johnson, Law, VetMed).\nTo apply for a federal student loan (U.S. citizens and eligible noncitizens only), complete the FAFSA form for the appropriate academic year, and:\nFederal loan limits and eligibility requirements apply. Federal loan funding is not available to visiting or non-matriculated students or for less-than half-time enrollment (typically, fewer than 6 credits per semester).\nLearn More about Federal Loans\nTo apply for a private education loan, submit a loan application directly to the private lender of your choice using the lender’s online application process. Your private lender will then ask Cornell University to certify your eligibility electronically.\nLearn More about Private Education Loans\nYour estimated cost of attendance for financial aid only includes mandatory fees charged to all students. Fees not charged to all students are excluded – for example, optional course fees, gym memberships, premium on-campus or off-campus housing options, and the cost of the Cornell Student Health Insurance Plan (SHP). Need-based grant or scholarship aid is not available for these costs.\nCornell requires all students to have health insurance. If you are not covered by a family policy or your insurance coverage does not meet university requirements, you will be automatically enrolled in and billed for the Cornell Student Health Plan (SHP). Because the cost of SHP is not charged to all students, it is not included in the estimated cost of attendance for financial aid.\nYou may request student loan funding to cover the cost of optional fees and the Cornell Student Health Insurance Plan (SHP).\nAll graduate and professional aid applicants are assigned an annual estimated Cost of Attendance budget (COA). Your COA includes typical billed and non-billed costs, is used to determine your eligibility for certain types of funding, including federal and private education loans.  Your actual costs to attend may vary. To access additional loan funds, you may need to request a Cost of Attendance Increase (annual loan limits apply).\nWe’re here to help! If you have questions about student loan funding, please contact the appropriate Cornell University financial aid office:\n• Ninety-nine percent of Cornell’s Ph.D. students are fully funded to pursue their degrees through a combination of competitive internal and external fellowships and research and teaching assistantships. These awards are typically offered by graduate fields and departments at the time of admission - application requirements vary.\n• Research master’s, professional, and executive degree programs offer limited financial assistance. Availability, terms, and application requirements vary - for more information, please contact the individual graduate professional program.\n• All eligible U.S. students* seeking federal student loan funding for graduate or professional degree programs must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).\n• For William D. Ford Direct Unsubsidized Loans – accept or decline your loan offer(s) in Student Center.\n• For Federal Graduate PLUS Loans – complete a Graduate PLUS Federal Loan Request form.\n• Eligibility criteria, interest rates, repayment terms, borrowing limits vary.\n• We recommend exhausting your William D.

(Please note that you must have been physically present in the exempt country for the majority of your enrollment.) Research degree applicants who meet this exemption will need to complete the English Language Assessment and may be offered an individual support plan.\n• At the time of enrollment at Cornell, will have studied and/or worked full-time for at least 2 consecutive years* within the last 10 years in a country where English is an official and widely spoken language. This experience must be noted on a transcript and/or described on a resume or CV. We will accept a combination of study and work—e.g., an applicant who completed a 1-year master’s degree in the U.S. followed by 1 year of OPT. If you are or were a student, the full-time study must have been for at least 2 consecutive academic years (potentially slightly less than 24 months) AND English must have been the language of instruction for your studies. (Please note that you must have been physically present in the exempt country for the majority of your enrollment.) Research degree applicants who meet this exemption will need to complete the English Language Assessment and may be offered an individual support plan.\n• Course by Course Evaluation:  Cornell Tech requires that transcripts from colleges and universities outside the U.S. and Canada undergo a course-by-course analysis by an expert academic credential evaluator in the United States. Students are responsible for paying all fees for such evaluations and making arrangements with the credential evaluation company to send and receive their documents. Applicants who attended a foreign institution that has an affiliation with a U.S. Based institution are exempt from this. NYU Shanghai and Abu Dhabi are two examples of institutions that fit this criteria.\n• Transcripts: International applicants must provide a certified English translation of transcripts if the original language is not English. Successful international applicants will have received a baccalaureate degree from a college or university of recognized standing. For more information, read Cornell’s policy on International Degree Equivalencies and International Transcripts.\n[GRID_TABLE]\nAdmissions Events\nAdmissions Events\nJacobs Technion-Cornell Dual MS Degrees Application\nJacobs Technion-Cornell Dual MS Degrees Application\nJohnson Cornell Tech MBA Application\nJohnson Cornell Tech MBA Application\nMaster of Engineering Application\nMaster of Engineering Application\nTuition & Fees\nTuition & Fees\nFrequently Asked Questions\nFrequently Asked Questions\nLearn More About Our Master's Programs\nLearn More About Our Master's Programs\nMaster of Laws (LLM) Application\nMaster of Laws (LLM) Application",
