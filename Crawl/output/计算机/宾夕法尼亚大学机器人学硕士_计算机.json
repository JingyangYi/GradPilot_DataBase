In addition, feel free to describe your background, why you’re interested in the program, if you have any research experience, and what you plan to do with the ROBO degree after graduation.\nThere is no departmental funding for Master’s students. A link to alternative funding sources can be found here and here for employment opportunities, here (under “Employment Resources”).\nThe Robotics M.S.E. requirements consist of a total of ten courses–at least three foundational courses, five technical elective courses, and at most two general elective courses. A thesis project is optional.\nAdmissions policies are available on the Graduate Admissions How to Apply page. Please refer there for information about TOEFL/IELTS requirements. Additional information on admission policy FAQs, can be referenced here as well.\nThe Robotics MSE program is usually 2 years and requires 10 course units.\nPer University policy, courses counted towards and/or listed on an undergraduate degree transcript, will not be considered for graduate credit unless in an approved and awarded accelerated master’s/submatriculation program. A final transcript is required and a statement (either on the transcript or in a letter from your undergraduate department) that the course(s) was not counted towards your undergraduate degree.\nIf you meet the above criteria, please complete the Graduate Transfer of Credit Petition form, and obtain all related documents. If approved, a maximum of two courses may be transferred to a Master’s program, and credit will only be awarded for courses earning a grade of ‘B’ or higher.\nAccelerated Master’s Course Proposal Form:Accelerated Masters will be required to fill out the Proposed Graduate Course-Load Form and submit along with their application materials.\nYou may apply for the Accelerated Master’s Program at any point before the start of your senior year at Penn.\nLinear Algebra (MATH 3120) and Basic Programming (CIS 1100 and CIS 1200) are a great foundation. Probability and statistics is also very useful. Overall, the more programming the better, like taking CIS 2400 and Python Programming can show confidence.\nPlease see the application requirements and process here. The Accelerated Master’s Application is now via Slate.\nIn addition to the Penn Engineering requirements, undergraduate applicants must have a minimum cumulative STEM GPA of 3.2 in order to apply.\nFor students completing their undergraduate degree at Penn and enrolled in a master’s degree as a Submatriculant or Accelerated Master’s student, please note undergraduate status supersedes graduate status. All courses will appear on the student’s undergraduate transcript while still enrolled as an undergraduate.  The graduate degree cannot be conferred until all coursework for the undergraduate degree is complete. Additionally, all coursework for the master’s degree must be completed at Penn – no transfer credit, advanced standing, study abroad, or study away courses will be accepted.  Undergraduate coursework should be completed in eight semesters as a submatriculant; it must be completed in eight semesters under the accelerated master’s. The only exception is for coordinated dual-degree students in M&T and VIPER where students must complete and graduate with both undergraduate degrees in their first ten semesters.\nFull information on Submatriculation and the Accelerated Master’s can be found on the Engineering Undergraduate Submatriculation page.\nStudents external to Penn: Students at Bryn Mawr College and Haverford College may apply to the Accelerated Master’s 4+1 program. Full information on this program can be found here.\nWe do not automatically accept transfers, but students may apply as long as they meet the following requirements:\nProcess for those who wish to apply to transfer in to the Robotics AM program:\nTransfer approvals are at the discretion of your current program. Transfers are not guaranteed.\nDue to the high demand, we are unable to automatically accept transfer or dual masters requests from students in other Master’s programs at Penn. Students who are interested in applying to the Robotics Master’s Program from other programs at Penn will be afforded an opportunity to be considered as part of the regular admission process with the deadline of February 1st. Please note that acceptance to the robotics program is highly competitive and that there are typically many more applicants than places available. Applications will only be accepted after 1 semester is completed in your current program at Penn. Students may not apply during the final year of their current program.\nProcess for those that wish to apply to internally transfer from another department within SEAS:\nProcess for those that wish to apply for a Dual Master’s with ROBO from another department within SEAS:\nAfter completing at least one semester in the original program for which you were accepted and matriculated, Penn Engineering master’s students may request to be considered for a transfer to another Engineering Master’s Program. Please see the question above on the application process. As with the request to be considered for a dual Master’s, candidates are expected to have the appropriate background for the second master’s program. They will be evaluated by both their original program and the new program to which they wish to transfer. Each on-campus student is only allowed to submit one transfer application during their studies at Penn Engineering. Incomplete applications or those submitted after the deadline noted above will not be reviewed.\nPlease note program transfers are for on-campus programs only.\nStudents interested in pursuing a dual Master’s major or degree in Penn Engineering should submit an Application for the Dual Master’s Major if enrolled in an MSE program or the Dual Master’s Degree if enrolled in MCIT, MBIOT, or M:IPD in Penn Engineering after completing at least one semester with a minimum GPA of 3.50. Please see the first question in this section for more details on the application process. Approval and signatures of the Program Directors from both departments along with a personal statement explaining why they wish to pursue the dual degree are required.  Students must complete a minimum of sixteen (16) course units including up to four (4) course units that satisfy both degree requirements as indicated on the application. Each on-campus student is only allowed to submit one dual master’s degree application during their studies at Penn Engineering. If a student who has been approved for a dual Master’s decides to graduate with just one of the two degrees/majors, the student can only drop the later program but not the original program that the student was admitted into. Incomplete applications or those submitted after the deadline noted above will not be reviewed.\nPlease note dual degrees are only approved for on-campus programs.\nPlease have your letter writer email their letter directly to the ROBO Graduate Coordinator, robo-coord@seas.upenn.edu.\nA welcome email will be sent to all admitted students that accepted their admission after June 1st with details on course selection and advisor preferences. There is no need to reach out to an advisor ahead of time since we will be assigning the students to our faculty members.\nLinks to all departmental permit and/or waitlist forms can be found here.\nStudents are welcome to petition for a course to be counted as a technical elective with valid reasoning, as long as the course in question is not listed on this page. Please keep in mind that approval of your petition is not guaranteed.\nThe petition for action form can be found on the Penn Engineering Graduate Forms page. Once the petition form is signed by your ROBO advisor, please email the completed form to robo-coord@seas.upenn.edu. The Graduate Coordinator will then submit your materials for review by the ROBO Program Chair and you can expect to hear a decision in one week.\nTypically students would need to take another elective in its place; finishing the degree with 11 CU’s.\nTA positions are provided through the departments. RA positions through the GRASP Lab are limited and setup directly with the faculty. Students may inquire about these opportunities towards the end or after their first semester on campus.\nAny graduate level course (500 level or above) in Mathematics, MCIT, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering or Mechanical Engineering, will automatically count as a general elective. If you feel you have good reasoning, you may petition for it to count as a technical elective, but it is not a guaranteed approval. Petition for Action form can be found here.\nMany ROBO students decide to take courses with these splits 3-3-2-2 or 3-2-3-2 in the Fall and Spring Semesters. Some have also split up their courses 3-3-3-1. Summers are usually set aside for internships (CPT for International students) and research opportunities. The program is very flexible in that way!\nInternational Students must be considered “full time” students in order to comply with visa regulations.

As a ROBO student, you will receive all of the announcements of GRASP academic and industry related events, as well as the job and internship opportunities that are passed through our email lists from our industry connections and alumni network. The opportunity to conduct research under GRASP Lab Faculty is in high demand by all, and as a ROBO student these research connections are at your fingertips!\nRequirements for the personal statement (*also required for internal Accelerated Master’s, Master’s transfer and dual Master’s requests)?\nExternal Applicants: Please reference the personal statement recommended guidelines here.\nInternal Applicants (Accelerated Masters, Internal Transfers or Dual Master’s): Please keep your personal statement to 1 to 2 pages. In addition, feel free to describe your background, why you’re interested in the program, if you have any research experience, and what you plan to do with the ROBO degree after graduation.\nIs there any Financial Aid for the Robotics Master‘s Program?\nThere is no departmental funding for Master’s students. A link to alternative funding sources can be found here and here for employment opportunities, here (under “Employment Resources”).\nIs the MSE program based on coursework or research?\nThe Robotics M.S.E. requirements consist of a total of ten courses–at least three foundational courses, five technical elective courses, and at most two general elective courses. A thesis project is optional.\nCan my TOEFL/IELTS score be waived?\nAdmissions policies are available on the Graduate Admissions How to Apply page. Please refer there for information about TOEFL/IELTS requirements. Additional information on admission policy FAQs, can be referenced here as well.\nHow long is the program?\nThe Robotics MSE program is usually 2 years and requires 10 course units.\nCan I transfer courses from other schools to count towards my Master’s degree?\nPer University policy, courses counted towards and/or listed on an undergraduate degree transcript, will not be considered for graduate credit unless in an approved and awarded accelerated master’s/submatriculation program. A final transcript is required and a statement (either on the transcript or in a letter from your undergraduate department) that the course(s) was not counted towards your undergraduate degree. \nIf you meet the above criteria, please complete the Graduate Transfer of Credit Petition form, and obtain all related documents. If approved, a maximum of two courses may be transferred to a Master’s program, and credit will only be awarded for courses earning a grade of ‘B’ or higher. \nAccelerated Master’s Course Proposal Form:Accelerated Masters will be required to fill out the Proposed Graduate Course-Load Form and submit along with their application materials.\nAccelerated Master’s Degree Program\nWhen should I apply?\nYou may apply for the Accelerated Master’s Program at any point before the start of your senior year at Penn.\nWhat courses would be helpful to take before  entering into the ROBO Master’s Program?\nLinear Algebra (MATH 3120) and Basic Programming (CIS 1100 and CIS 1200) are a great foundation. Probability and statistics is also very useful. Overall, the more programming the better, like taking CIS 2400 and Python Programming can show confidence.\nAdditional Application Requirements for Accelerated Master’s:\nPlease see the application requirements and process here. The Accelerated Master’s Application is now via Slate.\nIn addition to the Penn Engineering requirements, undergraduate applicants must have a minimum cumulative STEM GPA of 3.2 in order to apply. \nFor students completing their undergraduate degree at Penn and enrolled in a master’s degree as a Submatriculant or Accelerated Master’s student, please note undergraduate status supersedes graduate status. All courses will appear on the student’s undergraduate transcript while still enrolled as an undergraduate.  The graduate degree cannot be conferred until all coursework for the undergraduate degree is complete. Additionally, all coursework for the master’s degree must be completed at Penn – no transfer credit, advanced standing, study abroad, or study away courses will be accepted.  Undergraduate coursework should be completed in eight semesters as a submatriculant; it must be completed in eight semesters under the accelerated master’s. The only exception is for coordinated dual-degree students in M&T and VIPER where students must complete and graduate with both undergraduate degrees in their first ten semesters.\nFull information on Submatriculation and the Accelerated Master’s can be found on the Engineering Undergraduate Submatriculation page.\nStudents external to Penn: Students at Bryn Mawr College and Haverford College may apply to the Accelerated Master’s 4+1 program. Full information on this program can be found here.\nI was accepted into another Accelerated Master’s program, can I transfer into the Robotics AM program?\nWe do not automatically accept transfers, but students may apply as long as they meet the following requirements: \n\nYou must have completed at least one semester of your current AM program.\nYou must have completed at least two graduate level courses during your time at Penn.\n\nProcess for those who wish to apply to transfer in to the Robotics AM program:\n\nYou must speak with your current program first. \nThen submit your 2-3 page personal statement, the contact information for two professional references, your course planning form, and your unofficial transcript to robo-coord@seas.upenn.edu.\nSubmit your transfer request via the form here to complete the application process.\n\nTransfer approvals are at the discretion of your current program. Transfers are not guaranteed.\nInternal Transfers & Dual Master’s Students\nI was accepted to another MS program at Penn, could I transfer to the Robotic’s Master Program/can I apply for a dual master’s degree?\nDue to the high demand, we are unable to automatically accept transfer or dual masters requests from students in other Master’s programs at Penn. Students who are interested in applying to the Robotics Master’s Program from other programs at Penn will be afforded an opportunity to be considered as part of the regular admission process with the deadline of February 1st. Please note that acceptance to the robotics program is highly competitive and that there are typically many more applicants than places available. Applications will only be accepted after 1 semester is completed in your current program at Penn. Students may not apply during the final year of their current program.\nProcess for those that wish to apply to internally transfer from another department within SEAS:\n\nYou must speak with your current program first. Then submit your personal statement of 1 page or less, plus any additional documents including resume, letters of recommendation, etc. which are optional, in one combined PDF to robo-coord@seas.upenn.edu by February 1st.

Please see the question above on the application process. As with the request to be considered for a dual Master’s, candidates are expected to have the appropriate background for the second master’s program. They will be evaluated by both their original program and the new program to which they wish to transfer. Each on-campus student is only allowed to submit one transfer application during their studies at Penn Engineering. Incomplete applications or those submitted after the deadline noted above will not be reviewed.\nPlease note program transfers are for on-campus programs only.\nAdditional Information for Dual Master’s Students:\nStudents interested in pursuing a dual Master’s major or degree in Penn Engineering should submit an Application for the Dual Master’s Major if enrolled in an MSE program or the Dual Master’s Degree if enrolled in MCIT, MBIOT, or M:IPD in Penn Engineering after completing at least one semester with a minimum GPA of 3.50. Please see the first question in this section for more details on the application process. Approval and signatures of the Program Directors from both departments along with a personal statement explaining why they wish to pursue the dual degree are required.  Students must complete a minimum of sixteen (16) course units including up to four (4) course units that satisfy both degree requirements as indicated on the application. Each on-campus student is only allowed to submit one dual master’s degree application during their studies at Penn Engineering. If a student who has been approved for a dual Master’s decides to graduate with just one of the two degrees/majors, the student can only drop the later program but not the original program that the student was admitted into. Incomplete applications or those submitted after the deadline noted above will not be reviewed.\nPlease note dual degrees are only approved for on-campus programs.\nHow do I submit a recommendation letter?\nPlease have your letter writer email their letter directly to the ROBO Graduate Coordinator, robo-coord@seas.upenn.edu.\nCurrent Students\nHow do I select an advisor?\nA welcome email will be sent to all admitted students that accepted their admission after June 1st with details on course selection and advisor preferences. There is no need to reach out to an advisor ahead of time since we will be assigning the students to our faculty members.\nHow do I request a permit to enroll in a class or to be added to a waitlist?\nLinks to all departmental permit and/or waitlist forms can be found here.\nI would like a course to be counted as a technical elective, how can I do that?\nStudents are welcome to petition for a course to be counted as a technical elective with valid reasoning, as long as the course in question is not listed on this page. Please keep in mind that approval of your petition is not guaranteed.\nThe petition for action form can be found on the Penn Engineering Graduate Forms page. Once the petition form is signed by your ROBO advisor, please email the completed form to robo-coord@seas.upenn.edu. The Graduate Coordinator will then submit your materials for review by the ROBO Program Chair and you can expect to hear a decision in one week.\nIf I enroll in ROBO 597, what happens if I decide to not continue with thesis after completing the 1st semester?\nTypically students would need to take another elective in its place; finishing the degree with 11 CU’s.\nAre there any TA/RA positions available in your department?\nTA positions are provided through the departments. RA positions through the GRASP Lab are limited and setup directly with the faculty. Students may inquire about these opportunities towards the end or after their first semester on campus.\nA new course is available but not on the Robotics master’s list, can I count it towards my degree?\nAny graduate level course (500 level or above) in Mathematics, MCIT, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering or Mechanical Engineering, will automatically count as a general elective. If you feel you have good reasoning, you may petition for it to count as a technical elective, but it is not a guaranteed approval. Petition for Action form can be found here.\nIf I plan to graduate with ten courses taken, do I have to take three courses for two semesters and four courses for one semester? \nMany ROBO students decide to take courses with these splits 3-3-2-2 or 3-2-3-2 in the Fall and Spring Semesters. Some have also split up their courses 3-3-3-1. Summers are usually set aside for internships (CPT for International students) and research opportunities. The program is very flexible in that way!\nInternational Students must be considered “full time” students in order to comply with visa regulations. Full time status consists of 3 CU’s, so international students must plan to take at least 3 CU’s per semester and apply for a Reduced Course Load (RCL) for their final semester. If you have any questions, please meet with your ISSS advisor to discuss your request.\nIs it possible to transfer to another MSE program in SEAS?\nYes, you may apply to transfer to another Master’s Program after the completion of your first semester. Please see corresponding MSE program requirements. The transfer form can be found here.\nI need a letter to (examples listed): (1) verify my Full-time status, (2) verify that I am in good academic standing, (3) verify my expected date of graduation, (4) verify my dates of enrollment, (5) verify my degree awarded, (6) confirm that Penn does not rank students, or (7) invitation letter for the graduation ceremony?\nUse the “Request a Letter” Form here.\nAlumni\nHow do I get my Alumni email?\nHere are instructions for receiving your alumni email: https://www.alumni.upenn.edu/s/1587/gid2/16/interior.aspx?sid=1587&gid=2&pgid=15207\nHow do I request a letter?\nEmail rasforms@seas.upenn.edu with your specific request.\nApplication Information\nCurriculum Information\nProspective Students\nCurrent Students\nAccelerated Master’s\nInternational Students\nResources for Incoming Master’s Students\nRobotics Master’s FAQs\nResearch + Internships For Your ROBO Degree\nGRASP News\nThe GRASP Lab Goes to ISER 2025\nJuly 17, 2025\nFaculty News\nGeorge Pappas Receives IEEE Kirchmayer Award\nJuly 15, 2025\nFaculty News\nDesigning cleaner, greener concrete that absorbs carbon dioxide\nJuly 9, 2025",

This multi-disciplinary program is jointly sponsored by the Departments of Computer and Information Science, Electrical and Systems Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics.\nGetting Started\nRegistering for Courses\n\nPath@Penn– All course listings, schedules, and registration\n\nSome courses require permits or waitlists, links to permit/waitlist forms for each department can be found here. At the start of the Fall semester, you will have about two weeks to add and drop courses, giving you the opportunity to make enrollment changes if you wish.\nReference guides on how to use Path@Penn can be found here.\nHere are some other important resources to consult throughout your time in the program:\n\nROBO Curriculum Page – Familiarize yourself with which courses can count towards your foundational, technical, and general electives\nPenn Engineering’s Graduate Academic Calendar – Be sure to mark important deadlines (such as Add/Drop, and Advanced Registration) in your personal calendar!\nTuition Billing Schedule – Know when you will be billed for the courses you are enrolled in.\nGraduate Student Request Forms – Bookmark this page! All important forms for SEAS Grad Students can be found here, from the Petition for Action form, to graduation registration links.\n\n\nAdvising\nROBO MSE students are able to submit 2 preferences for their Faculty Advisor from our list of GRASP Faculty Advisors. Your Faculty Advisor will provide guidance on coursework, research, and post-graduation planning throughout your time in the program. We encourage students to familiarize themselves with our GRASP Faculty, and choose a Faculty Advisor whose research areas align with their own interests and goals. If a student does not wish to choose their advisor, one will be assigned to them.\nAdvisor preferences may be sent to robo-coord@seas.upenn.edu after June 20.\nROBO students should plan to meet with their Faculty Advisor once per semester to discuss their course plan, post-graduation plans, or to inquire about research opportunities or other resources. \nKeep in Mind: ROBO students are permitted to engage in research with any faculty member at Penn, not solely your assigned advisor.\nOther than your assigned Faculty Advisor, the Robotics Graduate Program Director, Dr. Ani Hsieh, is available to provide advising assistance, as is the Robotics Graduate Coordinator.\n\nParticipating in Research\nRobotics MSE students are encouraged (though not required) to participate in research during their time in the Program. If students would like to earn credit towards their degree while pursuing research at Penn, options include Master’s Thesis (ROBO 5970) or Capstone (ROBO 5980) and/or Independent Study (ROBO 5990).\nOutside of these courses, students are welcome to participate in research independently from their coursework. We encourage ROBO students to connect with GRASP Faculty members to inquire about current projects and potential collaborations. For more information, or to find out best contacts for research inquiries, please visit the Research and Your ROBO Degree page.\n\nInternational Students\nAll International Students at Penn will be assigned an ISSS Advisor. This is your best contact for all questions pertaining to your I-20, visa requirements, and check-in procedures.\nIf you are in need of a travel letter, please send an email to robo-coord@seas.upenn.edu with your full name (as it appears on your passport), birth date, and country of citizenship. With this information we will be able to produce a travel letter within 72 hours (typically sooner).\n\nApplying for CPT – All information regarding CPT procedures at Penn Engineering can be found here.\n\nROBO Student Contacts\nIf you have a program-related question that is best suited for a current student, the following current ROBO MSE student has graciously volunteered to answer questions from the incoming class:\n\nOnyekwe Ifeanyichukwu Benedict – onyekwei@seas.upenn.edu\nTanaya Gupte – tanayag@seas.upenn.edu\nVisweswaran Baskaran – visb@seas.upenn.edu\nJason Xie (ROBO ’24) – jchunx@alumni.upenn.edu\nVaidehi Som (ROBO ’24) – somv@seas.upenn.edu\nPankti Hitesh Parekh (ROBO ’23) – pankti81@alumni.upenn.edu\n\n\nQUESTIONS\nGraduate Coordinator for ROBOOffice: The GRASP Treehouse in Building 250 at the Pennovation Centerrobo-coord@seas.upenn.edu\nRegistering for Courses\nAdvising\nParticipating in Research\nInternational Students\nROBO Student Contacts\nQUESTIONS\nApplication Information\nCurriculum Information\nProspective Students\nCurrent Students\nAccelerated Master’s\nInternational Students\nResources for Incoming Master’s Students\nRobotics Master’s FAQs\nResearch + Internships For Your ROBO Degree\nGRASP News\nThe GRASP Lab Goes to ISER 2025\nJuly 17, 2025\nFaculty News\nGeorge Pappas Receives IEEE Kirchmayer Award\nJuly 15, 2025\nFaculty News\nDesigning cleaner, greener concrete that absorbs carbon dioxide\nJuly 9, 2025\n[GRID_TABLE]\nRegistering for Courses\nAdvising\nParticipating in Research\nInternational Students\nROBO Student Contacts\nQUESTIONS",
