These rapidly evolving technologies are creating a significant skills gap that needs to be bridged to keep pace with development and maintenance demands. This specialised MSc program in Internet of Things (IoT) with AI is designed to cultivate experts in designing and deploying sophisticated IoT systems enhanced with smart machine learning algorithms. The comprehensive programme promotes a thorough grasp of IoT frameworks, computer networks and their security, communication standards, and data analysis, as well as mastery in machine learning methodologies, including neural networks, both supervised and unsupervised learning, and deep learning strategies.\nYou will gain practical skills by directly interacting with cutting-edge IoT platforms and machine learning applications, preparing you to create innovative, data-driven solutions for modern challenges. The programme also emphasises the ethical and secure management of IoT data, with a commitment to privacy, responsible innovation, and compliance with regulatory standards.\nBy blending academic theory with practical exercises, this programme aims to prepare you for a variety of roles across multiple industries, such as smart urban development, healthcare, and industrial automation. The curriculum is also designed to foster a culture of continuous learning and flexibility, positioning graduates to lead in the adoption of new technological trends within their professional endeavours as outlined in the Bristol Futures Curriculum Framework as follows:\nHear directly from an academic giving you a deeper insight into this programme.\nThe programme is designed to provide a comprehensive educational experience, combining structured learning with independent self-study, preparing students for careers in the IoT industry. The units in the programme will cover essential topics for aspiring IoT engineers, providing a comprehensive foundation. The teaching process is designed to cultivate independent learning, enabling students to adapt to new and emerging concepts in this fast-growing discipline. Emphasis will be given on critical thinking, problem-solving, and practical application through these units.\nThe programme offers students the chance to enhance their analytical, communication, and experimental abilities. Throughout the programme, students are expected to demonstrate proficiency in scientific writing, oral presentations, teamwork, problem-solving, utilisation of library and internet resources, and time management. Formative assessments and small-group tutorials will encourage students to actively seek and appreciate constructive feedback to enhance their self-awareness. Each student will be matched with a dedicated personal tutor who will provide both academic and pastoral support, engage in ongoing progress discussions, offer guidance on project selection, and assist students in navigating career choices.\nVisit our programme catalogue for full details of the structure and unit content of this programme.\nThe University of Bristol is ranked fifth for research in the UK (Times Higher Education).\n94% of our research assessed as world-leading or internationally excellent.\nYou will typically need an upper second-class honours degree or an international equivalent in one of the following subjects:\nOther Engineering and numerate Science degrees may be considered where a UK minimum score of 60% (or international equivalent) is achieved in five modules from the following:\nUnfortunately, applicants with an Engineering background in Materials Science. Mechanical Engineering, Civil Engineering, or Chemical Engineering will not be considered suitable for this programme.\nIf you are currently completing a degree, we understand that your final grade may be higher than the interim grades or module/unit grades you have achieved during your studies to date.\nWe will consider your application if your interim grades are currently slightly lower than the programme's entry requirements and may make you an aspirational offer. This offer would be at the standard level, so you would need to achieve the standard entry requirements by the end of your degree. Specific module requirements would still apply.\nWe will also consider your application if your grades are slightly lower than the programme's entry requirements, if you have at least one of the following:\nIf this is the case, applicants should include their CV (curriculum vitae / résumé) when they apply, showing details of their relevant qualification.\nSee international equivalent qualifications on the International Office website.\nRead the programme admissions statement for important information on entry requirements, the application process and supporting documents required.\nIf English is not your first language, you will need to reach the requirements outlined in our profile level E.\nFurther information about English language requirements and profile levels.\nFees are subject to an annual review. For programmes that last longer than one year, please budget for up to an 8% increase in fees each year.\nMore about tuition fees, living costs and financial support.\nUniversity of Bristol students and graduates can benefit from a 25% reduction in tuition fees for postgraduate study. Check your eligibility for an alumni discount.\nFurther information on funding for prospective UK and international postgraduate students.\nThis programme covers the technical, analytical and soft skills required for an IoT engineer and students would likely go on to careers as: IoT Engineer; AI/Machine Learning Engineer; IoT Solutions Architect; Data Scientist/Analyst; Embedded Systems Engineer; Research Scientist; Network Engineer; and Cloud Engineer.\nFaculty of Science and Engineering\nSchool of Electrical, Electronic and Mechanical Engineering\n• MSc\n• The programme prepares you to be a leader in your field by fostering an innovative mindset and encouraging you to stay abreast of emerging technologies and industry trends, ensuring your continued relevance.

We refer to these skill levels as ‘profiles’. The profile for your chosen course or programme is shown on the course page or programme page.\nThe tests and levels you need to achieve to meet the requirements are on each English language profile page.\nEnglish language proficiency tests should be obtained within two years of the start date of your programme or course.\nIf you are from, or have studied in, an English-speaking country, you may not need to provide additional evidence of your English language ability.\nEnglish language qualifications must be presented in English. If the qualification evidence is not in English you must provide a professional or certified translation, including the contact details for the translator or translation company.\nYou do not need to have reached the required level before you apply.\nWe will look at your academic qualifications and decide what offer we will make you. If you haven’t yet reached the required English level, we will give you a target grade to meet as part of your offer.\nIf you have the required level, you must include it in your application. You do not need to do anything else. If you are a national of an English-speaking country as defined by UK Visas and Immigration, then you may be considered to have the required level. You can find further details, including the list of these countries, in each of our English language profiles.\nIf you haven’t reached the required level for your course or programme, you will be given a target grade in your offer.\nYou will need to provide a valid English language qualification showing you have met the required target grade.\nIf you don’t have the required level, you can try one of the following:\n• Taking a pre-sessional language course offered by the University\n• Taking an IELTS Academic test\n• Taking a different course in your home country which qualifies (see the list under the profile)\n• Re-sitting the language tests in your home country to reach the required level.",
