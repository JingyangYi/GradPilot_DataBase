(Photo By Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call)\nCyberCorps (R): Scholarship For Service (SFS) is a unique, fully-funded scholarship program designed to increase and strengthen the cadre of federal information assurance professionals that protect the government’s critical information infrastructure. This program provides scholarships that may fully fund the typical costs incurred by full-time students, including tuition and related education fees. Additionally, participants currently receive stipends of $37,000 for graduate students. The scholarships are funded through grants awarded by the National Science Foundation. After graduation, participants must fulfill a government service obligation for a period equivalent to the length of their scholarship (up to two years; odd-semester programs are rounded up). Eligible students are encouraged to visit the national program website: https://www.sfs.opm.gov/ . The scholarships are funded through grants awarded by the National Science Foundation.\nScholarship:\nThe scholarship program will cover tuition for the program of study. Students also receive a stipend that is intended to contribute to, or cover the cost of living expenses. In addition, travel funds and book allowance are available for students. (Funds are to spend on relevant activities and book purchases). The student must then work for a Federal, State, Local, or Tribal Government organization in an information assurance position for a period equivalent to the length of the scholarship or one year, whichever is longer. For example, if the student is funded for a full two-year period, he or she must serve at a federal agency for two calendar years (though programs that have an odd number of semesters are rounded up).

If you receive more than one offer, it is your choice which one you accept.\nQ: What if I want to leave my job before the required period of service ends?\nYou must repay scholarship funds and stipends as a prorated amount equivalent to the length of time not served.

Numerous resources are available including an annual job fair specifically for SFS students as well as the assistance of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) which oversees permanent placement for scholarship students.\nFull details about all responsibilities related to the scholarship can be found here.\nStudents who are interested in applying for the Scholarship for Service Program must complete the standard application process for the MSSI program, which is:\n\nThe JHU application\nTwo letters of recommendation\nTranscripts from all institutions attended\nGRE scores\nStatement of Purpose\nAn up to date resume\n\nFurthermore, for those who would like to apply for SFS you will additionally need to provide:\n\nA one-page essay detailing academic, professional, and personal goals, and how participation in the Scholarship for Service Program will help achieve these goals, uploaded along with your admission application, as a supplemental document.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nQ: May I participate in this program either completely or partially online?\nNo. While some of the courses have online components, all require actual in-person attendance at JHU as a full-time student. No other external employment is allowed.\nQ: How can I search for qualified internships or employment to meet my obligations under this scholarship?\nYou will be required to register on the CyberCorps® SFS website and complete an online resume, which government organizations will search for job candidates. You also will be provided with financial means to attend a job recruitment fair each January during the term supported by CyberCorps®. Additionally, you are encouraged to register at USAJobs.gov/StudentsAndGrads to proactively seek federal internship and employment opportunities. These sites provide current job vacancies and, in some cases, allow you to apply online.\nQ: Where will I work?\nYou may fulfill your internship and job commitments at any federal, local, state or tribal agency; independent agency; government corporation, or commission. Students may also serve at a national laboratory or federally funded research development center (FFRDC), such as Sandia National Labs. A list of these organizations is provided at USA.gov, at USAJobs, and at NSF.gov . If you receive an internship or job offer at one of the approved agencies, you are expected to accept. If you receive more than one offer, it is your choice which one you accept.\nQ: What if I want to leave my job before the required period of service ends?\nYou must repay scholarship funds and stipends as a prorated amount equivalent to the length of time not served. Details are outlined in the Service Agreement.\nQ: What if I change jobs during the service period?\nYou are required to notify the SFS Program Office of any employment changes, ensuring that they have updated contact information.\nQ: Are permanent residents of the United States eligible for this program?\nYes, both US citizens and lawful permanent residents are eligible for this program.\nAdditional FAQs are listed on the federal government’s Office of Personnel Management SFS website: https://www.sfs.opm.gov/StudFAQ.aspx\nFor additional information, contact:\n[email protected]\nGraduate Studies at ISI\nAdmissions\nProgram Requirements\n\nMSSI Course Distribution\nCapstone Project\nDual-Degree Opportunities\n\n\nPh.D. Program\nScholarships\n\nCybercorps: Scholarship for Service Program\n\n\nPart-Time and Online Programs (Engineering for Professionals)\nGraduate Studies at ISI\nAdmissions\nProgram Requirements\n\nMSSI Course Distribution\nCapstone Project\nDual-Degree Opportunities\nMSSI Course Distribution\nCapstone Project\nDual-Degree Opportunities\nPh.D. Program\nScholarships\n\nCybercorps: Scholarship for Service Program\nCybercorps: Scholarship for Service Program\nCybercorps: Scholarship for Service Program\nPart-Time and Online Programs (Engineering for Professionals)",
