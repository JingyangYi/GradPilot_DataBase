Understanding and optimizing these systems is crucial, and digital technologies offer tools for observation and insight. The Connected Environments MSc at the Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA) is a forward-thinking degree with a focus on building, coding, and deploying devices to sense, communicate, and analyse data related to our built and natural environments. This programme addresses the industry need for skills in programming, data capture, visualisation, and prototyping to tackle key environmental challenges. Delivered at the new UCL East campus on the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in Stratford, East London, the course uses state-of-the-art facilities and shared labs that foster interdisciplinary collaboration. The location also serves as a living lab, offering hands-on, practice-led teaching that guides students through building and deploying physical prototypes. Building on CASA's expertise in the science of cities, the programme emphasises understanding the infrastructure needed to instrument and analyse complex environments. Students will learn to develop sensing tools, support decision making, and engage with stakeholders to analyse real world systems. Key learning objectives include: Mastering the Internet of Things (IoT) best practices in urban contextsPrototyping IoT systems and developing embedded AI techniques Creating mobile and web applications for data collection and storage Collaborating with stakeholders to understand IoT politics and economics Acquiring and analysing data scientifically Developing data analytics skills Communicating effectively through writing and presentations Conducting independent research Co-developed with industry as a result of a five-year academic research collaboration between UCL and Intel, this programme prepares students for careers in the Internet of Things (IoT), Smart Cities, Data Science, and Visualisation.\n\n Who this course is for\nWe aim for a multidisciplinary cohort and therefore are looking for prospective students with undergraduate qualifications ranging from the Arts, Computer Science, Geography, Architecture and Engineering. \n\n\n Read about what it takes to study for a Master's at UCL\n\n\n What this course will give you\nUnique skills: The programme is unique in that it develops a skill set required to deliver end-to-end solutions from developing stakeholder requirements, understanding technology, building prototypes, through to understanding how to influence decision makers.Learn within a living lab: Our unique approach means that our research and teaching are delivered within a living lab environment. With our new location at UCL East, devices are deployed within our building, across the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, and further afield. We believe in learning through doing, with practice-led teaching to guide you through the building and deployment of physical prototypes. Exposure to live projects: Our research-led teaching is delivered by staff who are working on live research projects providing exposure to experts working at the cutting edge of developments in IoT.  Access to a ‘World leading’ research environment: The UCL Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA) is a renowned research centre in the science of cities; generating new knowledge and insights for use in city planning, policy and design; and drawing on the latest geospatial methods and ideas in computer-based visualisation and modelling. It is part of UCL’s Bartlett Faculty of the Built Environment, where 91% of research was deemed ‘World Leading’ and ‘Internationally Excellent’ in the latest Research Excellence Framework (REF 2021).

Those who develop a passion for research continue their academic pursuits through PhD programs.  \nNetworking\nA regular series of seminars given by guest lecturers provides students with an opportunity to learn form, and network with, academics and professionals from UCL and other prestigious organisations.Additionally, students gain access to our extensive alumni network of professionals via our careers and alumni events.\nTeaching and learning\nThe programme’s core curriculum is typically delivered through a combination of lectures, tutorials, and lab classes, as well as directed and self-directed learning supported by teaching materials and resources, published through the online virtual learning environment. Each module employs a teaching strategy that aligns with and supports its intended learning outcomes. Hands-on work is a key element of this programme, and practical classes and workshops are integrated throughout the curriculum. Lectures, seminars, and tutorials build up theoretical learning that can be applied to practical work. Demonstrations and site visits allow you to understand and visualise the real-world implementation of digital technologies, while guest speakers from industry provide yet more context.  You will be assessed through a range of methods across the programme, including individual and group projects, written research reports, other coursework, and a final research project/dissertation. The dissertation is an opportunity for you to work on a specific topic that is of particular interest to you. You will be invited to showcase your work at an end of year show attended by academics, industry partners and the public. Full-time students can typically expect between 13 (term 1) and 16 (term 2) contact hours per teaching week, through a mixture of lectures and practical workshops. In term 3, students’ time will be dedicated to practical work towards their dissertation and contact time will take the form of weekly one-to-one tutorials with a Dissertation Tutor.Outside of directed teaching, full-time students typically study the equivalent of a full-time job, using their remaining time for self-directed study and completing coursework assignments.\n\nModules\n\n\nFull-time\n\n\nThe Connected Environments MSc consists of eight compulsory taught modules, worth 15 credits each (120 credits total).

These Connected Environment technologies are the forefront of an emerging science, interlinking the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence, (AI), Virtual Reality (VR) and Data Science. This programme will introduce you to electronics, programming and the design process. You will gain hands-on experience of everything from idea generation to prototyping and deployment.\nApplications closed\nApplications closed\nA minimum of an upper second-class Bachelor's degree in a relevant discipline from a UK university or an overseas qualification of an equivalent standard.\nThe English language level for this programme is:                                      Level 2\nUCL Pre-Master's and Pre-sessional English courses are for international students who are aiming to study for a postgraduate degree at UCL. The courses will develop your academic English and academic skills required to succeed at postgraduate level.\nFurther information can be found on our English language requirements page.\nCountry-specific information, including details of when UCL representatives are visiting your part of the world, can be obtained from the International Students website.\nInternational applicants can find out the equivalent qualification for their country by selecting from the list below. Please note that the equivalency will correspond to the broad UK degree classification stated on this page (e.g. upper second-class). Where a specific overall percentage is required in the UK qualification, the international equivalency will be higher than that stated below. Please contact Graduate Admissions should you require further advice.\nUCL Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis has a long history of thinking about the science of cities and how data can help us understand our complex environments. Our goal for the Connected Environments programme is to extend this activity further and focus on the research challenges that relate to the infrastructure required to instrument and understand our built and natural environments from an end to end perspective – i.e from understanding what to sense, through to developing tools to support decision making. As such the course builds on the need for a skill set in programming, data capture and visualisation, and prototyping with stakeholders to support the analysis of complex systems.\nThe course will be delivered at the brand new UCL East campus on the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in Stratford, East London. This is the biggest development in our 200-year history, and our accessible, state-of-the-art facilities will have shared labs and workshop spaces open to all, to facilitate collaboration across different disciplines. Research staff in the Connected Environments Lab have been working with stakeholders in the park for the past 10 years and have established a living lab environment in both the buildings and the surrounding landscape.\nThe programme has been co-developed with industry as a result of a 5 year industry academic research collaboration between UCL and Intel. A number of key learning objectives motivated the programme:\nWe aim for a multidisciplinary cohort and therefore are looking for prospective students with undergraduate qualifications ranging from the Arts, Computer Science, Geography, Architecture and Engineering.\nThe UCL Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA) is one of the leading research centres in the science of cities, generating new knowledge and insights for use in city planning, policy and design, and drawing on the latest geospatial methods and ideas in computer-based visualisation and modelling.\nThe programme is unique in that it develops a skill set required to deliver end-to-end solutions from developing stakeholder requirements, understanding technology, building prototypes, through to understanding how to influence decision makers. Our research led teaching is delivered by staff who are working on live research projects providing exposure to experts working at the cutting edge of developments in IoT.\nThe programme will enable you to: apply your skills in problem solving, communication, information retrieval, working with others and the effective use of general IT facilities; plan self-learning and improve performance, as the foundation for lifelong learning / continuing professional development; monitor and adjust a personal programme of work on an on-going basis; exercise initiative and personal responsibility.\nKey Highlights from REF 2021:\nThis programme takes a holistic view toward developing the skill sets digital practitioners require. You will learn how to deliver end-to-end solutions from prototyping in hardware and software, to maintaining live sensor installations for the duration of the course. The technical activity is equally balanced with an understanding of the socio / economic factors such as stakeholder engagement and business model development for connected environment infrastructure.\nThe end-to-end approach, the focus on learning through making, and prototyping real-world solutions are all critical to developing the transferable skill set which is employable in this emerging market place.\nAlumni from programmes at the Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis have gone on to work in a variety of roles across the sector including Movement Strategies, Arup, Westminster Council and Lendlease with placements around the world. Many have also gone on to acquire Doctorates either with UCL or at other leading institutions around the world with those further advancing into academia.\nA regular series of seminars given by guest lecturers provides students with an opportunity to learn form, and network with, academics and professionals from UCL and other prestigious organisations.\nAdditionally, students gain access to our extensive alumni network of professionals via our careers and alumni events.\nThe programme’s core curriculum is typically delivered through a combination of lectures, tutorials, and lab classes, as well as directed and self-directed learning supported by teaching materials and resources, published through the online virtual learning environment. Each module employs a teaching strategy that aligns with and supports its intended learning outcomes.\nHands-on work is a key element of this programme, and practical classes and workshops are integrated throughout the curriculum. Lectures, seminars, and tutorials build up theoretical learning that can be applied to practical work. Demonstrations and site visits allow you to understand and visualise the real-world implementation of digital technologies, while guest speakers from industry provide yet more context.\nYou will be assessed through a range of methods across the programme, including individual and group projects, written research reports, other coursework, programming tests, and a final research project/dissertation. The dissertation is an opportunity for you to work on a specific topic that is of particular interest to you. You will be invited to showcase your work at an end of year show attended by academics, industry partners and the public.\nContact time takes a variety of forms, including lectures, seminars, tutorials, project supervisions, demonstrations, practical classes and workshops, visits, placements, office hours (where staff are available for consultation), email, videoconference, or other media, and situations where feedback on assessed work is given (one-to-one or in a group).\nEach module has a credit value that indicates the total notional learning hours a learner will spend on average to achieve its learning outcomes. One credit is typically described as being equal to 10 hours of notional learning, which includes all contact time, self-directed study, and assessment.\nThe contact time for each of your 15 credit taught modules will typically include 22-30 hours of teaching activity over the term of its delivery, with the balance then consisting of self-directed learning and working on your assessments. You will have ongoing contact with teaching staff via each module’s online discussion forum, which is typically used for discussing and clarifying concepts or assessment matters and will have the opportunity to access additional support via regular office hours with module leaders and programme directors.\nYour research project/dissertation module is 60 credits and will include regular contact with your project supervisor(s), who will guide and support you throughout your project. You will dedicate most of your time on this module to carrying out research in connection with your project and writing up your final report.\nContact time takes a variety of forms, including lectures, seminars, tutorials, project supervisions, demonstrations, practical classes and workshops, visits, placements, office hours (where staff are available for consultation), email, videoconference, or other media, and situations where feedback on assessed work is given (one-to-one or in a group).\nEach module has a credit value that indicates the total notional learning hours a learner will spend on average to achieve its learning outcomes.

A number of key learning objectives motivated the programme:\n\nUnderstanding of current state of art IoT best practice in an urban context.\nEnable skills to prototype IoT systems\nDevelop skills in embedded AI techniques\nDevelop mobile and web applications to collect and store time-series data\nWork with stakeholders to gain insight into the politics and economics of IoT\nScientifically acquire and analyse data\nUse data analytics skills\nCommunicate effectively through academic writing and oral presentations\nCarry out independent research\n\n\n Who this course is for\nWe aim for a multidisciplinary cohort and therefore are looking for prospective students with undergraduate qualifications ranging from the Arts, Computer Science, Geography, Architecture and Engineering. \n\n\n Read about what it takes to study for a Master's at UCL\n\n\n What this course will give you\nThe UCL Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA) is one of the leading research centres in the science of cities, generating new knowledge and insights for use in city planning, policy and design, and drawing on the latest geospatial methods and ideas in computer-based visualisation and modelling.\nThe programme is unique in that it develops a skill set required to deliver end-to-end solutions from developing stakeholder requirements, understanding technology, building prototypes, through to understanding how to influence decision makers. Our research led teaching is delivered by staff who are working on live research projects providing exposure to experts working at the cutting edge of developments in IoT. \nThe programme will enable you to: apply your skills in problem solving, communication, information retrieval, working with others and the effective use of general IT facilities; plan self-learning and improve performance, as the foundation for lifelong learning / continuing professional development; monitor and adjust a personal programme of work on an on-going basis; exercise initiative and personal responsibility.\nKey Highlights from REF 2021:\n\nThe Bartlett is where the UK’s most ‘World Leading’ and ‘Internationally Excellent’ built environment research is undertaken. \n91% of our research has been deemed ‘World Leading’ and ‘Internationally Excellent’.\nThe Bartlett is number one for Research Power in the built environment.  It is the UK’s largest faculty of the built environment and REF 2021 has confirmed both our unique breadth, and excellence across this portfolio.\n\n\n\n Read about what you'll get out of a graduate programme\n\n\n\n\n\nThe foundation of your career\nThis programme takes a holistic view toward developing the skill sets digital practitioners require. You will learn how to deliver end-to-end solutions from prototyping in hardware and software, to maintaining live sensor installations for the duration of the course. The technical activity is equally balanced with an understanding of the socio / economic factors such as stakeholder engagement and business model development for connected environment infrastructure.\nThe end-to-end approach, the focus on learning through making, and prototyping real-world solutions are all critical to developing the transferable skill set which is employable in this emerging market place.\nEmployability\nAlumni from programmes at the Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis have gone on to work in a variety of roles across the sector including Movement Strategies, Arup, Westminster Council and Lendlease with placements around the world. Many have also gone on to acquire Doctorates either with UCL or at other leading institutions around the world with those further advancing into academia. \nNetworking\nA regular series of seminars given by guest lecturers provides students with an opportunity to learn form, and network with, academics and professionals from UCL and other prestigious organisations.\nAdditionally, students gain access to our extensive alumni network of professionals via our careers and alumni events. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeaching and learning\nThe programme’s core curriculum is typically delivered through a combination of lectures, tutorials, and lab classes, as well as directed and self-directed learning supported by teaching materials and resources, published through the online virtual learning environment. Each module employs a teaching strategy that aligns with and supports its intended learning outcomes.\nHands-on work is a key element of this programme, and practical classes and workshops are integrated throughout the curriculum. Lectures, seminars, and tutorials build up theoretical learning that can be applied to practical work. Demonstrations and site visits allow you to understand and visualise the real-world implementation of digital technologies, while guest speakers from industry provide yet more context.\n \n\n You will be assessed through a range of methods across the programme, including individual and group projects, written research reports, other coursework, programming tests, and a final research project/dissertation. The dissertation is an opportunity for you to work on a specific topic that is of particular interest to you. You will be invited to showcase your work at an end of year show attended by academics, industry partners and the public. Contact time takes a variety of forms, including lectures, seminars, tutorials, project supervisions, demonstrations, practical classes and workshops, visits, placements, office hours (where staff are available for consultation), email, videoconference, or other media, and situations where feedback on assessed work is given (one-to-one or in a group).\nEach module has a credit value that indicates the total notional learning hours a learner will spend on average to achieve its learning outcomes. One credit is typically described as being equal to 10 hours of notional learning, which includes all contact time, self-directed study, and assessment.\nThe contact time for each of your 15 credit taught modules will typically include 22-30 hours of teaching activity over the term of its delivery, with the balance then consisting of self-directed learning and working on your assessments. You will have ongoing contact with teaching staff via each module’s online discussion forum, which is typically used for discussing and clarifying concepts or assessment matters and will have the opportunity to access additional support via regular office hours with module leaders and programme directors.\nYour research project/dissertation module is 60 credits and will include regular contact with your project supervisor(s), who will guide and support you throughout your project. You will dedicate most of your time on this module to carrying out research in connection with your project and writing up your final report.\n\n\nModules\n\n\nFull-time\n\n\nC﻿ompulsory Taught Modules (120 credits):\nCASA0014 Connected Environments (15 credits)\nCASA0015 Mobile Systems & Interactions (15 credits)\nCASA0016 Making, Designing & Building Connected Sensor Systems (15 credits)\nCASA0017 Web Architecture (15 credits)\nCASA0018 Deep Learning for Sensor Networks (15 credits)\nCASA0019 Sensor Data Visualisation (15 credits)\nCASA0020 Ethics, Sustainability and Business of the Internet of Things (15 credits)\nCASA0021 Connected Environments Group Prototype and Pitch (15 credits)\nCompulsory Research Modules (60 credits):\nCASA0022 Dissertation (60 credits) \n\nPart-time\n\n\nStudents studying part-time (2 years) should follow the programme structure given below:\nPart-time Year One\n• CASA0014\n• CASA0015\n• CASA0016\n• CASA0020\nPart-time Year Two\n• CASA0017\n• CASA0018\n• CASA0019\n• CASA0021\n• CASA0022 \n\nFlexible\n\n\nFor students who enrol on modular/flexible study (with 5 years in which to complete the programme), it is recommend that students enrol on each module in the numerical sequence given: CASA0014, CASA0016, CASA0017, CASA0020, CASA0015, CASA0018, CASA0019, and CASA0021 .\nCASA0014 is the required first module, taken before any other (to be completed in Year 1).\nCASA0015 AND CASA0018 both require prior programming experience before being studied .\nCASA0021 is intended to be a final activity of the programme and should be left to the final year. \n\n\nCompulsory modules\n\n Connected Environments \n\n\n Mobile Systems & Interactions \n\n\n Making, Designing & Building Connected Sensor Systems \n\n\n Web Architecture \n\n\n Deep Learning for Sensor Networks \n\n\n Sensor Data Visualisation \n\n\n Ethics, Sustainability and Business of the Internet of Things \n\n\n Connected Environments Group Prototype and Pitch \n\n\n Dissertation \n\n\n\nPlease note that the list of modules given here is indicative.

Our goal for the Connected Environments programme is to extend this activity further and focus on the research challenges that relate to the infrastructure required to instrument and understand our built and natural environments from an end to end perspective – i.e from understanding what to sense, through to developing tools to support decision making. As such the course builds on the need for a skill set in programming, data capture and visualisation, and prototyping with stakeholders to support the analysis of complex systems. \nThe course will be delivered at the brand new UCL East campus on the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in Stratford, East London. This is the biggest development in our 200-year history, and our accessible, state-of-the-art facilities will have shared labs and workshop spaces open to all, to facilitate collaboration across different disciplines.

Our goal for the Connected Environments programme is to extend this activity further and focus on the research challenges that relate to the infrastructure required to instrument and understand our built and natural environments from an end to end perspective – i.e from understanding what to sense, through to developing tools to support decision making. As such the course builds on the need for a skill set in programming, data capture and visualisation, and prototyping with stakeholders to support the analysis of complex systems. \nThe course will be delivered at the brand new UCL East campus on the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in Stratford, East London. This is the biggest development in our 200-year history, and our accessible, state-of-the-art facilities will have shared labs and workshop spaces open to all, to facilitate collaboration across different disciplines. Research staff in the Connected Environments Lab have been working with stakeholders in the park for the past 10 years and have established a living lab environment in both the buildings and the surrounding landscape.\nThe programme has been co-developed with industry as a result of a 5 year industry academic research collaboration between UCL and Intel. A number of key learning objectives motivated the programme:\n\nUnderstanding of current state of art IoT best practice in an urban context.\nEnable skills to prototype IoT systems\nDevelop skills in embedded AI techniques\nDevelop mobile and web applications to collect and store time-series data\nWork with stakeholders to gain insight into the politics and economics of IoT\nScientifically acquire and analyse data\nUse data analytics skills\nCommunicate effectively through academic writing and oral presentations\nCarry out independent research\n\n\n Who this course is for\nWe aim for a multidisciplinary cohort and therefore are looking for prospective students with undergraduate qualifications ranging from the Arts, Computer Science, Geography, Architecture and Engineering. \n\n\n Read about what it takes to study for a Master's at UCL\n\n\n What this course will give you\nThe UCL Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA) is one of the leading research centres in the science of cities, generating new knowledge and insights for use in city planning, policy and design, and drawing on the latest geospatial methods and ideas in computer-based visualisation and modelling.\nThe programme is unique in that it develops a skill set required to deliver end-to-end solutions from developing stakeholder requirements, understanding technology, building prototypes, through to understanding how to influence decision makers. Our research led teaching is delivered by staff who are working on live research projects providing exposure to experts working at the cutting edge of developments in IoT. \nThe programme will enable you to: apply your skills in problem solving, communication, information retrieval, working with others and the effective use of general IT facilities; plan self-learning and improve performance, as the foundation for lifelong learning / continuing professional development; monitor and adjust a personal programme of work on an on-going basis; exercise initiative and personal responsibility.\nKey Highlights from REF 2021:\n\nThe Bartlett is where the UK’s most ‘World Leading’ and ‘Internationally Excellent’ built environment research is undertaken. \n91% of our research has been deemed ‘World Leading’ and ‘Internationally Excellent’.\nThe Bartlett is number one for Research Power in the built environment.  It is the UK’s largest faculty of the built environment and REF 2021 has confirmed both our unique breadth, and excellence across this portfolio.\n\n\n\n Read about what you'll get out of a graduate programme\nThe foundation of your career\nThis programme takes a holistic view toward developing the skill sets digital practitioners require. You will learn how to deliver end-to-end solutions from prototyping in hardware and software, to maintaining live sensor installations for the duration of the course. The technical activity is equally balanced with an understanding of the socio / economic factors such as stakeholder engagement and business model development for connected environment infrastructure.\nThe end-to-end approach, the focus on learning through making, and prototyping real-world solutions are all critical to developing the transferable skill set which is employable in this emerging market place.\nEmployability\nAlumni from programmes at the Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis have gone on to work in a variety of roles across the sector including Movement Strategies, Arup, Westminster Council and Lendlease with placements around the world. Many have also gone on to acquire Doctorates either with UCL or at other leading institutions around the world with those further advancing into academia. \nNetworking\nA regular series of seminars given by guest lecturers provides students with an opportunity to learn form, and network with, academics and professionals from UCL and other prestigious organisations.\nAdditionally, students gain access to our extensive alumni network of professionals via our careers and alumni events.\nTeaching and learning\nThe programme’s core curriculum is typically delivered through a combination of lectures, tutorials, and lab classes, as well as directed and self-directed learning supported by teaching materials and resources, published through the online virtual learning environment. Each module employs a teaching strategy that aligns with and supports its intended learning outcomes.\nHands-on work is a key element of this programme, and practical classes and workshops are integrated throughout the curriculum. Lectures, seminars, and tutorials build up theoretical learning that can be applied to practical work. Demonstrations and site visits allow you to understand and visualise the real-world implementation of digital technologies, while guest speakers from industry provide yet more context.\n \n\n You will be assessed through a range of methods across the programme, including individual and group projects, written research reports, other coursework, programming tests, and a final research project/dissertation. The dissertation is an opportunity for you to work on a specific topic that is of particular interest to you. You will be invited to showcase your work at an end of year show attended by academics, industry partners and the public. Contact time takes a variety of forms, including lectures, seminars, tutorials, project supervisions, demonstrations, practical classes and workshops, visits, placements, office hours (where staff are available for consultation), email, videoconference, or other media, and situations where feedback on assessed work is given (one-to-one or in a group).\nEach module has a credit value that indicates the total notional learning hours a learner will spend on average to achieve its learning outcomes. One credit is typically described as being equal to 10 hours of notional learning, which includes all contact time, self-directed study, and assessment.\nThe contact time for each of your 15 credit taught modules will typically include 22-30 hours of teaching activity over the term of its delivery, with the balance then consisting of self-directed learning and working on your assessments. You will have ongoing contact with teaching staff via each module’s online discussion forum, which is typically used for discussing and clarifying concepts or assessment matters and will have the opportunity to access additional support via regular office hours with module leaders and programme directors.\nYour research project/dissertation module is 60 credits and will include regular contact with your project supervisor(s), who will guide and support you throughout your project. You will dedicate most of your time on this module to carrying out research in connection with your project and writing up your final report.\n\n\nModules\n\n\nFull-time\n\n\nC﻿ompulsory Taught Modules (120 credits):\nCASA0014 Connected Environments (15 credits)\nCASA0015 Mobile Systems & Interactions (15 credits)\nCASA0016 Making, Designing & Building Connected Sensor Systems (15 credits)\nCASA0017 Web Architecture (15 credits)\nCASA0018 Deep Learning for Sensor Networks (15 credits)\nCASA0019 Sensor Data Visualisation (15 credits)\nCASA0020 Ethics, Sustainability and Business of the Internet of Things (15 credits)\nCASA0021 Connected Environments Group Prototype and Pitch (15 credits)\nCompulsory Research Modules (60 credits):\nCASA0022 Dissertation (60 credits) \n\nPart-time\n\n\nStudents studying part-time (2 years) should follow the programme structure given below:\nPart-time Year One\n• CASA0014\n• CASA0015\n• CASA0016\n• CASA0020\nPart-time Year Two\n• CASA0017\n• CASA0018\n• CASA0019\n• CASA0021\n• CASA0022 \n\nFlexible\n\n\nFor students who enrol on modular/flexible study (with 5 years in which to complete the programme), it is recommend that students enrol on each module in the numerical sequence given: CASA0014, CASA0016, CASA0017, CASA0020, CASA0015, CASA0018, CASA0019, and CASA0021 .\nCASA0014 is the required first module, taken before any other (to be completed in Year 1).\nCASA0015 AND CASA0018 both require prior programming experience before being studied .\nCASA0021 is intended to be a final activity of the programme and should be left to the final year. \n\n\nCompulsory modules\n\n Connected Environments \n\n\n Mobile Systems & Interactions \n\n\n Making, Designing & Building Connected Sensor Systems \n\n\n Web Architecture \n\n\n Deep Learning for Sensor Networks \n\n\n Sensor Data Visualisation \n\n\n Ethics, Sustainability and Business of the Internet of Things \n\n\n Connected Environments Group Prototype and Pitch \n\n\n Dissertation \n\n\n\nPlease note that the list of modules given here is indicative.

These entry requirements apply to all our Teacher Training PGCE courses.\nA first or second-class UK Bachelor’s degree in an appropriate subject, or an overseas qualification of an equivalent standard from a recognised higher education institution is normally required.\nCandidates who are judged not to have sufficient subject knowledge for certain secondary PGCE courses may be required to undertake a Subject Knowledge Enhancement (SKE) course. The length of SKE varies depending on the need of the individual – from eight-week ‘refresher’ or ‘booster’ courses, through to more extensive 36-week courses.\nFor some courses, applicants whose degree qualifications are lower than 2:2 standard may be admitted if they can demonstrate an appropriate academic background at master’s level and above and/or significant postgraduate experience in the relevant field.\nPlease note that we will not consider applicants to any Initial Teacher Education (ITE) programmes that already hold the professional teaching qualification that the intended UCL PGCE programme leads to - QTS, QTLS, EYTS. For example, an applicant who already holds Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) is ineligible to apply for any ITE course that leads to QTS.\nFor all courses, a GCSE, or comparable qualification, at grade C or 4 is required in English Language and Mathematics.\nFor Primary education, (pupils aged 3–11) and Early Years Initial Teacher Training (EYITT) working with children aged 0-5; a GCSE grade C or 4 is also required in a science subject (we do not accept Additional Science or Applied Science). Please note that the PGCE Primary (Specialist Mathematics) course requires a GCSE grade 5 in Mathematics.\nWe do not accept English taught as a second language or English Literature to meet our GCSE English Language requirements.\nWe do not accept BTEC, functional skills or Access qualifications in place of GCSEs.\nApplicants who do not offer a GCSE in English Language or Mathematics at grade 4 may demonstrate an equivalent standard by completing either the Mathematics Foundation, Mathematics Higher or English from Equivalency Testing or A Star Equivalency and achieve at least a grade 4.\nFor GCSE Science we will accept either Combined Science or Biology taken with one of these providers.\nIf you are made an offer you will be required to successfully complete Occupational Health and Disclosure Barring Service (DBS) Enhanced Disclosure checks.\nFrom October 2024, the Occupational Health Check is £100 and, depending on your DBS requirements, there may be an additional fee between £12.75 to £25.50, depending on the number of documents checked, if you submit your DBS Enhanced Disclosure check via a UK Post Office.\nAll teacher training candidates who are offered a place at UCL must be certified as meeting national requirements for physical and mental fitness to teach, as set by the Department for Education. We apply the Fitness to Teach requirement to all our PGCE candidates who must complete a health questionnaire for scrutiny by our occupational health provider.\nIf you are offered a place on a teacher training courses, you will be asked to apply for an Enhanced, Child-workforce, fee paid Disclosure certificate from the Disclosure Barring Service (DBS). A satisfactory certificate is a condition of entry to the course, as we need to assess your suitability for access to children and vulnerable adults. This document will contain details of any cautions, convictions, reprimands, warnings or bindovers recorded against your name (even where they would ordinarily be considered spent) or confirm that you have none.\nIf the ITE Admissions team is able to confirm that you hold a DBS certificate valid for entry to a UCL PGCE course, which is also registered with the DBS Update Service, you will not be required to complete a new DBS check linked to UCL. If you do not have a valid DBS Update Service subscription then you will need to complete a new DBS linked to UCL. Maintaining a subscription to the DBS Update Service throughout the PGCE course is recommended.\nIf you have lived, worked, studied or travelled in any single country outside of the UK for six continuous months or more, in the last five years, you will be required to obtain a Certificate of Good Conduct from the relevant country/countries. Please note that absences of less than six weeks, from a country outside of the UK are not considered as a break in residency. Please note that the police check should be applied for within one month of your departure date to ensure the police certificate issued covers the period you were in a country.\nPossession of a criminal record will not necessarily bar you from entry to your chosen course of study. If your disclosure certificate reveals details about an offence or other matter, we will ask you to provide a brief written account of the circumstances of the incident(s) and any mitigating factors that you feel are relevant, in order to make an informed decision on your suitability for admission. Please refer to our policy statement on the recruitment of ex-offenders.\nFurther information about the Enhanced Disclosure check will be provided in our offer letter, if your application to UCL is successful.\nStudents who are enrolled on an initial teacher training course at UCL which will involve a placement with a primary school or setting in its later years provision and/or early years provision (nursery and reception classes) need to be aware of the requirements of the following:\nAccording to the above legislation, it is an offence for a student teacher who is disqualified from working in early years childcare or relevant later years childcare to do so or to be directly involved in the management of such provision. Please see our guidance document for more information on the grounds for disqualification.\nBoth the Act and Regulations mean that we will ask offer holders for certain UCL courses to provide a self-declaration form to UCL.\nEarly years childcare includes any supervised activity for a young child which takes place on a school’s premises during or outside of the normal school day.  A child is considered a ‘young child’ for the period up to 1 September after their 5th birthday.  Any teaching placements in nursery and reception classes will be classed as early years childcare.\nLater years childcare includes provision by a school for children who are not in early years but who are under the age of 8, which takes place on a school’s premises outside of the normal school day. This includes wraparound care before and after the school day, such as breakfast clubs and after school care. It does not include teaching during the school day or extended school hours for co-curricular activities such as sports activities.\nWe have set out below what this means for your application depending on which teacher training course you have applied to study on.\nIf you are offered a place on the above courses, including through the IOE Lead Partner Direct route, you will be required to submit a self-declaration form before you enrol. This form will ask you to declare whether you have been disqualified from a childcare role. More information on how to complete and submit this form will be sent to all successful applicants.\nYour employer will be responsible for making sure that you are not disqualified from a childcare role.\nIf you are offered a place on the above courses, including through the IOE Lead Partner Direct route, you will be required to sign a declaration confirming that you have read the information regarding childcare disqualification and return this to UCL. More information on how to complete and submit this form will be sent to all successful applicants.\nIf you are a successful applicant who is then placed in a nursery or reception class you will be asked to complete the childcare disqualification declaration before you go on placement. This will ask you to declare whether you have been disqualified from working in a childcare role. If, at this stage, it becomes clear that any of the disqualification criteria apply to you then UCL will ensure that you are not placed in an early years childcare placement.\nIf any of the disqualification criteria apply to you and you will be undertaking a placement in early years childcare as part of your UCL initial teacher training course, then you will not be able to enrol on your initial teacher training course at UCL unless you have a waiver from Ofsted before the commencement of the course.\nThe disqualified individual must apply for the waiver from Ofsted themselves. For more information, please see the guidance issued by Ofsted.\nAll EYITT, Primary and Secondary Trainees will be assured against a set of fundamental Mathematics and English skills by the end of their teacher training.\nSchool experience is not a mandatory entry requirement for our PGCE courses. For this reason, you do not need to have completed school experience prior to applying. However, we tend to find that applicants with experience perform better if invited to interview and we would therefore recommend that you endeavour to gain experience as soon as it becomes practical to do so. If you have future experience already arranged, please be sure to mention this in your application.\nThe English language level for teacher training programmes is UCL Level 2.\nUCL requires two suitable references.\nIt is expected that one of your references will be academic and from someone who has taught you at degree level, unless you have been out of higher education for more than five years.\nAs two references are required, you may provide one professional reference in place of the second academic reference.\nYou will be asked to enter the details of your referees in your application form. Your referees will be sent an email asking them to write a reference for you and to submit it online. For EYITT PGCE applicants, referees will be contacted as soon as the application is submitted. For all other PGCE programmes, referees will be contacted when you accept your conditional offer.\nPlease ensure you have spoken to your chosen referees so that they are expecting the invitation and are happy to provide a reference for you online.\nWhen providing the email address for your referee, where possible please use an academic or professional address rather than a personal address, e.g. [john.smith@university.ac.uk] rather than [johnsmith@hotmail.com]. UCL may require further information from references provided via personal email addresses, which may delay the process.\n• Childcare Act 2006 (Act)\n• Childcare (Disqualification) and Childcare (Early Years Provision Free of Charge) (Extended Entitlement) (Amendment) Regulations 2018 (Regulations)\n• DfE statutory guidance, Disqualification Under the Childcare Act 2006 (DUCA)\n• Childcare Disqualification – Grounds for Disqualification\n• Graduate degrees\n• Taught degrees Taught Degrees\nApplying for Graduate Taught Study at UCL\n• Taught degrees\n• Taught Degrees\n• Applying for Graduate Taught Study at UCL\n• Taught degrees\n• Taught Degrees\n• Applying for Graduate Taught Study at UCL\n• Research degrees\n• Research Degrees\n• Funded Research Opportunities\n• Doctoral School\n• Funded Doctoral Training Programmes\n• Applying for Graduate Research Study at UCL\n• Teacher training\n• Teacher Training\n• Early Years PGCE courses\n• Primary PGCE courses\n• Secondary PGCE courses\n• Further Education PGCE programme\n• Entry requirements\n• How to apply\n• The IOE approach\n• Teacher training in the heart of London\n• Why choose UCL?\n• Why choose UCL?\n• Entrepreneurship\n• Inspiring facilities and resources\n• Careers and employability\n• UCL Impact\n• Your global alumni community\n• Your wellbeing\n• Postgraduate Students' Association\n• Your life in London\n• Your life in London\n• Accommodation\n[GRID_TABLE]\nGraduate degrees \n\n\nEntry requirements \nRead details on UCL’s minimum entrance requirements for teacher training courses.

Find more specific information about a programme’s content from that academic department’s website.\nMost opportunities (and potential funding) are not advertised or packaged as studentships. If you meet the entry requirements, be proactive to identify opportunities with UCL academics whose recent research closely match your interests.\nThere are three main ways to identify an appropriate supervisor to contact:\nBefore you apply, contact the academic department to discuss your suitability and to ensure a suitable supervisor is available\nIf an academic is impressed with your research experience and proposal, they may be able to help you identify sources of funding (including from their own, or departmental, research funds). They can also nominate you for scholarships.\nNot sure which programme to apply to or about life at UCL? Join one of our many recruitment events.\nYou need to check you meet the minimum academic and English language entry requirements for the programme. Entry requirements are clearly listed on each programme’s prospectus page.\nCarefully consider how you will fund your studies. This includes tuition fees and the day-to-day costs of being a research student.\nSee our scholarship and funding pages to check if you are eligible for UCL funding. This is a separate application and different deadlines apply.\nIf you are an international student, you might need a visa to study at UCL. Please check our immigration and visas pages for more information about applying for a visa to study.\nFor graduate research degree programmes at UCL, there may be the possibility to transfer into a programme from another institution or department.\nThe number of references needed to support your application can be found on the prospectus page for your programme. See selecting your references for details on who to choose.\nyou should contact your nominated referee(s) before starting your application to check they can provide a reference for you\nSee your programme’s prospectus page for deadline information.\nIf your programme has a set application deadline, you must submit your application before 5pm (UK time) on the day of the application deadline.\nIf your programme has no application deadline, we recommend you apply at least 4 months before your intended start date.\nif you are applying for funding, there may be separate deadlines set by the academic department\nAs part of your application, you must provide the following supporting documents:\nApplications should be submitted online.\nBefore you submit your application, please carefully check the information you have provided or uploaded. Once you have submitted your application, you can only update your name, contact details, referees’ details (if applicable) and passport details (if you require a visa).\nyou cannot replace or add additional documents once you have submitted your application\nYou should make sure:\nIf you are unable to apply online due to accessibility reasons, please contact Graduate Admissions.\nWe advise that you add donotreplyadmissions@ucl.ac.uk to your list of approved contacts so that you receive any correspondence sent by the Graduate Admissions Office.\n• Browse research programmes to find centres of research in your area of interest. Click through to the department or centre website to find staff profiles.\n• Search for relevant academic units and potential supervisors by keyword using UCL’s Institutional Research Information System (IRIS). Not all academics are listed in IRIS but it is a good place to start.\n• Search our online research repository (UCL Discovery) where all UCL’s research papers are published, subject to approvals. If you identify a research paper that particularly interests you, it is likely that one of the authors would be a suitable research supervisor.\n• Your official transcript. Please read our guide on getting your academic transcript. This explains exactly what UCL can and cannot accept. Sending documents that cannot be accepted will delay your application being processed.\n• A research proposal. Your research proposal is an important part of your application. It should outline the area of research you wish to undertake, demonstrate your knowledge of the subject area and summarise the question you want to answer through your research.\n• If you need a visa to study at UCL you will need to provide a copy of your current passport.

You will have to pay tuition fees for your chosen programme and will need money to cover your living expenses.\nUCL's tuition fees are set annually and cover registration, tuition and supervision for each academic year, or part of the academic year that you are enrolled. Tuition fees are subject to an annual increase of up to 5% annually (except for Overseas UG fees and all PG Taught fees which are now fixed at the rate at entry), which should be accounted for when you are applying for a programme.\nFees are normally quoted at the full-time rate, except where the programme is offered part-time or modular/flexible only. Fees for part-time or modular study are normally charged pro-rata to the appropriate full-time Master's fee taken in an academic session. Most fees are quoted in GBP, but some are in other currencies.\nUCL's tuition fees are set annually and cover registration, tuition and supervision for each academic year, or part of the academic year that you are enrolled. Tuition fees are subject to an annual increase of up to 5%, which should be accounted for when you are applying for a programme.\nFees are normally quoted at the full-time rate, except where the programme is offered part-time or modular/flexible only. Fees for part-time or modular study are normally charged pro-rata to the appropriate full-time Master's fee taken in an academic session. Most fees are quoted in UK Pounds but some are in other currencies.\nDetails about fees for individual programmes can be found on the specific programme information pages.\nResearch programmes at UCL may be subject to an Additional Fee Element (AFE). The AFE is applied to cover additional costs related to consumables, equipment and materials and other items (excluding student visas) which are not included in the composite tuition fee listed in the fees schedule and is, therefore, applied to a minority of programmes.\nAs each PhD programme is unique in its nature, the AFE is calculated on a student by student basis and is determined by the supervisor. The AFE is banded into four fixed amounts: £1,000, £2,500, £5,000 and £10,000, with one further band for variable sums over £10,000. Please contact your supervisor directly for advice on whether or not your programme will incur an AFE. Please note that you will be informed in your offer letter of any AFE you will be required to pay.\nAt some UK institutions the AFE may be referred to as bench fees.\nThe level of tuition fee charged will also depend on whether you are classified as a UK or Overseas student. It is likely that you will already know into which category you will fall, but this will be confirmed if you are offered a place to study at UCL. Your fee classification plays no part in deciding whether or not to offer you a place to study at UCL.\nEach student's fee classification is determined in accordance with the 2007 Education (Fees and Awards) (England) Regulations (SI No. 779) and subsequent amendments, and is based upon information that you have provided on your application.\nFor full-time and part-time students your tuition fee will normally be quoted on your offer letter. For flexible/modular students, fees will be assessed according to the number of credits selected, therefore a fee will not be quoted on your offer letter.\nYou must pay at least 1/3 of your tuition fee before or at enrolment to be fully enrolled, or provide a letter of sponsorship indicating who should be invoiced for your fee.\nStudents can pay in three equal instalments; the first before or at enrolment, the second by 7 February and the third by 2 May. No charge is made for paying in instalments, and no more than three instalments are permitted. No discount is offered for paying in full at the start of your programme.\nUCL requires successful applicants to postgraduate taught programmes to pay a tuition fee deposit.\nFor Full-time and Part-time offer holders a fee deposit will be charged at 10% of the first year fee.\nFor flexible/modular offer holders a £500 fee deposit will be charged.\nThere is usually no fee deposit required for PG Dip and PG Cert applicants.\nPayment of the deposit allows applicants to demonstrate their commitment to attending their chosen programme of study at UCL and aids UCL in its student number planning. Once a successful applicant is enrolled on their programme of study, the deposit will form part of the total tuition fee, as quoted on the offer of admission.\nPlease note that the required tuition fee deposit must be paid in full by the deadline specified in the offer of admission, which will usually be no earlier than 1 April for entry the following September.\nSome programmes will have earlier deadlines and you should consult your offer letter for the deadline which applies to you.\nPlease take time to read UCL's tuition fee deposit policy. Payment of the tuition fee deposit (in full or in part) will be considered as acceptance of the terms detailed in the policy.\nFind out all you need to know about tuition fee deposits for postgraduate study with our frequently asked questions.\nFind out all you need to know about our tuition fee deposits policy for 2025 entry.\nThe UK has now formally left the EU.

Tuition fees are subject to an annual increase of up to 5% annually (except for Overseas UG fees and all PG Taught fees which are now fixed at the rate at entry), which should be accounted for when you are applying for a programme.Fees are normally quoted at the full-time rate, except where the programme is offered part-time or modular/flexible only. Fees for part-time or modular study are normally charged pro-rata to the appropriate full-time Master's fee taken in an academic session.
