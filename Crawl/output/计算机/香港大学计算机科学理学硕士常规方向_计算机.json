It taps into the unique position of Hong Kong in the global financial market and was launched with the mission to nurture technologically adept and business savvy talents who can offer innovative solutions to the businesses in Hong Kong. We train professionals who can satisfy this demand. We also incorporate some advanced and meritorious components to help students keep abreast with the fast advances in IT technologies.When students exit from the programme, they continue to be able to separate the hype from the reality, to analyze new developments, synthesize and integrate them with established, sound structures and concepts, and to spot niches and opportunities for entrepreneurial ventures.Students are required to complete either 48 credits plus a dissertation (equivalent to 24 credits), or 60 credits plus a case study project (equivalent to 12 credits) to graduate.\n\n\nEntrance Requirements\n\n1.

The newly established School of Computing and Data Science (SCDS) at The University of Hong Kong encompasses the existing Department of Computer Science and the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science.  We have about 60 renowned scientists and 800 postgraduate students and offer 14 academic programmes.The School, through a cross-faculty integration, will create a powerful synergy between computational technology, mathematical modelling and statistical reasoning that have become the cornerstones of modern data science and artificial intelligence.  By combining the complementary strengths of computer science and statistics curricula, students graduating from the school will have strong analytical and computational skills. The School will also serve as a thriving hub for interdisciplinary academic and research collaborations, fostering partnerships with all other faculties that leverage the potential of modern data science and AI. The taught postgraduate programmes offered by the School will provide students with the latest knowledge and skills in computing & data science technologies and prepare them for the demands of the industry and job market.
