we equip ourselves with the knowledge and skills to understand and navigate the future it creates. The MA in AI, Ethics and Society programme is designed for individuals who want to be at the forefront of this revolution and shape it for the better.The Master of Arts in the field of AI, Ethics and Society (MA-AIES) is a full-time one-year programme that specialises in the normative investigation of AI and related technologies, their impact and trajectories. The programme takes as its starting point ethical, social and political questions about whether and how we should let AI and related technologies transform our lives: Should we, for example, let AIs make decisions for us when we don't fully understand why those decisions are made? How can we ensure that the decisions made by AIs are fair or just? How should we detect and deal with biases and security risks in AIs? How might AI technology affect privacy, politics, and personal relationships? These issues are now pressing in domains as varied as finance, government, law, medicine, engineering, education, military, and art. The programme aims to meet these intellectual and practical challenges in two ways: (i) Show how these challenges can be understood within frameworks of morality, justice, and social theory. (ii) Use these general frameworks to identify and address new ethical, social, and economic challenges as they arise in practice from the application of AI and emerging technologies.Through a rigorous curriculum students will gain a deep understanding of the ethical, social, and economic implications of AI and emerging technologies. At the end of the programme, they will be in a position to apply this knowledge in various contexts, including policy-making, business strategy, ethical design, creative industries, education, and research.The programme has a dedicated career advisor who will assist students and graduates, to ensure that participants receive tailored guidance and support as they transition into their professional careers.What sets the MA in the field of AI, Ethics and Society programme apart is its interdisciplinary approach, which draws on a range of fields, including philosophy, computer science, social sciences, and humanities. As part of the programme, students will have the opportunity to engage with cutting-edge research through HKU's AI&Humanity Lab, where they can access leading scholars and engage in discussions with visitors from around the world. Regular talks and presentations from experts in the field will also provide a platform for students to expand their knowledge and explore the intersection of artificial intelligence and society.\n\n\nMedium of Instruction\nEnglish\n\n\nEntrance Requirements\n\nBachelor's degree with a major in philosophy; or Bachelor's degree with a major in another subject with experience of studying issues relevant to AI, Ethics and Society.\n\n\n\nDownload Documents\n\r\n                                        For additional information, we recommend reviewing the following documents:\r\n                                    \n\nAdditional Information\n\nPDF Document\r\n                                        \n\n\nRegulations & Syllabuses\n\nPDF Document\r\n                                        \n\n\nSupporting Documents\n\nPDF Document\r\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFaculty\nFaculty of Arts\n\r\n                                            The Faculty of Arts is one of the flagship faculties of The University of Hong Kong (HKU) and is an internationally renowned and leading humanities faculty.

With dual expertise in both Asian and western art history, the department offers a unique programme enabling students to conduct in-depth study in Asian art, western art, and intercultural aspects of art. One required core course introduces advanced academic skills in art historical methodology, research, and writing, with a second required core course introducing advanced curatorial skills in techniques and materials, connoisseurship, and the art industry. Students are also required to attend a core course on art history writing, which focuses on trainings of critical thinking, scholarly writing and research methods. Elective courses give students the flexibility to shape a curriculum suitable to their individual needs and interests. The MA dissertation is a capstone course completed during the summer months under the supervision of an expert supervisor.\n\n\nMedium of Instruction\nEnglish\n\n\nEntrance Requirements\n\nA good bachelor's degree with a major in art history; or a bachelor's degree in another subject and substantial art-related experience.\n\n\n\nDownload Documents\n\r\n                                        For additional information, we recommend reviewing the following documents:\r\n                                    \n\nAdditional Information\n\nPDF Document\r\n                                        \n\n\nRegulations & Syllabuses\n\nPDF Document\r\n                                        \n\n\nSupporting Documents\n\nPDF Document\r\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFaculty\nFaculty of Arts\n\r\n                                            The Faculty of Arts is one of the flagship faculties of The University of Hong Kong (HKU) and is an internationally renowned and leading humanities faculty.
