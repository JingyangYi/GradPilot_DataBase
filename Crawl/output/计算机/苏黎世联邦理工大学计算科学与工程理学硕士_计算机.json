RW/CSE graduates will be able to understand a problem from the scientific and technological point of view and have the requisite skills to perform a computer-based analysis.\nThey will be capable of working and thinking in an interdisciplinary way. Computational science and engineering means mathematical modelling, numerical solution techniques and the use of computers to analyse and solve scientific and technological problems. Besides studies in the fields of application from science and engineering, students will learn how to use the most important mathematical methods and computer tools.\nCSE is different from both computer science and the traditional science and engineering. It represents a third scientific way in addition to theory and experiment. In brief, computa­tional science and engineering is interdisciplinary, application oriented, focused on problem solving, and based on computer simulation.\nRW/CSE graduates are able to communicate with specialists from the areas of mathe­matics, physics, chemistry, biology, engineering and computer science and work together with them in finding solutions to complex practical problems. The interdisciplinary edu­cation the RW/CSE curriculum provides in mathematics, computer science and application is an ideal basis for a career in industry and business.\nThe first two semesters are used for two core courses, for elective courses and for lectures from the fields of specialization chosen by the students, as well as for a term paper. The last semester is reserved for the Master thesis.\n90 ECTS | 1.5 years\nMaster of Science ETH in Computational Science and Engineering\nDownload MSc Computational Science and Engineering (PDF, 133 KB)\nMaster’s degree programme in Computational Science and Engineering\nETH Zurich\n                    Department of Mathematics\n                    Raemistrasse 101\n                HG GO 52.2\n                8092 \n                Zurich\n            Switzerland\n• Homepage\n• Navigation\n• Search\n• Content\n• Footer\n• Contact\n• Sitemap\n• Astrophysics\n• Physics of the Atmosphere\n• Chemistry\n• Fluid Dynamics\n• Control Theory\n• Robotics\n• Physics\n• Computational Finance\n• Electromagnetics\n• Phone\n                        +41 44 632 34 48\n[CARD]\nContact\nDr. Vasile Gradinaru\n\n\n\nPhone\n                        +41 44 632 34 48\n\n\n\n\n\n            ETH Zurich\n                    Department of Mathematics\n                    Raemistrasse 101\n                HG GO 52.2\n                8092 \n                Zurich\n            Switzerland\n\n\n\n\n\n              Show more\n\n              Show less\n[CARD]\nContact\n[CARD]\nDr. Vasile Gradinaru\n\n\n\nPhone\n                        +41 44 632 34 48\n\n\n\n\n\n            ETH Zurich\n                    Department of Mathematics\n                    Raemistrasse 101\n                HG GO 52.2\n                8092 \n                Zurich\n            Switzerland\n\n\n\n\n\n              Show more\n\n              Show less\n[CARD]\nDr. Vasile Gradinaru\n[CARD]\nPhone\n                        +41 44 632 34 48\n[CARD]\nETH Zurich\n                    Department of Mathematics\n                    Raemistrasse 101\n                HG GO 52.2\n                8092 \n                Zurich\n            Switzerland\n[CARD]\nShow more\n\n              Show less",

      "content": "[HEADING] Master\n[HEADING] The Master Program in CSE\nThe Master students have to acquire 120 ECTS mainly in mandatory Core Courses, in eligible Fields of Specialization and Elective Courses as described above for the Bachelor Program and with a Term Paper and a Master Thesis, respectively.\nNote: students that started their Msc CSE studies before Fall 2024 are in the old regulation with 90 ETCS  in theoretically 3 semester. This is the only difference in the two regulations.\nQualification profile for the CSE Master Programm\nRequirement Profile for the CSE Master Program\nImportant note for the applicant An application to the MSc programme CSE at ETH Zurich is pointless, unless your academic record clearly states that you had an education (course) in\nDescription of the courses is COMPULSORY. If you do not use the next hints, your application might not be processed:\nPlease write a course description IN YOUR OWN words of the subjects YOU studied in the class. Do not attach or copy/paste official course descriptions, do not wrtite names of books.\nExample of good description of the lecture Numerical Methods:\nFORMAT: lecture: 2h, exercices: 2h, laboratory: 3h per week, 12 weeks, programming language: C++,\nCONTENTS: Computing with Matrices and Vectors, Direct Methods for linear systems of equations, Least Squares, Data Interpolation and Fitting, Filtering Algorithms, Approximation of Functions in 1D, Quadrature, Iterative Methods for non-linear systems of equations.\nExample of good description of the lecture Linear Algebra:\nFORMAT: lecture: 2h, exercices 2h per week, 12 weeks, programming language: Python\nCONTENTS: linear equations, linear transformations, determinants, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, bilinear forms, canonical forms for matrices, euclidean and unitary vector spaces, selected applications.\nExample of bad description of lecture Numerical Methods:\nThis lecture covers the most important and useful numerical methods and algorithms for this degree programe.\nExample of bad description of a lecture called \"Mathematcis II\":\nName and Name, \"Elementary Linear Algebra\";  Name  and Name , \"Complex Variables and Applications\".\nThere is no hard threshold on the grade. However, the admission committee takes into account the previous performance of the applicants and very good grades in the CSE relevant subjects are expected.\nRefusal of admission Candidates will not be admitted to the CSE Master Program if they still need to complete studies accounting for more than 30 credit points to qualify for admission. These candidates may apply for admission to the CSE Bachelor Program. The details of the admission procedure are regulated in the Rules on Admission to Studies at ETH (Zulassungsverordnung ETHZ).\nImportant links for students from outside ETH  International Student Information: www.study.ethz.ch\nApplication forms (electronic): www.eapply.ethz.ch\nThe list of courses changes over the time, see  here for the core courses in FS22 and here for HS21.\nTwo Core Courses have to be chosen and exams passed.\nThe rules for the seminar depend on the specialization area. However, 4 ECTS credits are awarded for the seminar in the specialization area, roughly equivalent to 120h of work. In order to avoid excessive workload this should be taken into account when fixing the seminar topic and deliverables. You may show this text to your seminar supervisor.\nStudents have to take 2 Elective Courses and pass the exams. At least 6 ECTS are necessary, but usually much more are earned.\nStudents have to attend twice the CSE Case Studies Seminar as described  for the Bachelor Program, more details are here.\nGuidelines (current) to the CSE Master Program\n• Homepage\n• Navigation\n• Search\n• Content\n• Footer\n• Contact\n• Sitemap\n• basic mathematics (calculus and linear algebra)\n• programming (C, C++, FORTRAN, etc); fluency in C++ prior joining CSE is important\n• basic numerical methods\n• foundations of physics\n• Advanced Numerical Methods\n• Advanced Machine Learning\n• Probabilistic Artificial Inteligence\n• Computational Statistics\n• Advanced Systems Lab\n• Optimization for Data Science\n• Deep Learning in Scientific Computing\n• Astrophysics\n• Physics of the Atmosphere\n• Chemistry\n• Fluid Dynamics\n• Control Theory\n• Robotics\n• Physics\n• Computational Finance\n• Electromagnetics\n• Geophysics\n• Biology",
