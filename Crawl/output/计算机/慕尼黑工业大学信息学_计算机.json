You will receive an e-mail asking you to confirm your thesis registration. Only after you have confirmed your registration, the Academic Programs Office will be able to check the admission requirements, and you will receive an email confirming your binding registration for your thesis.\nUnder Abschlussarbeiten on the CIT Knowledge Hub employees can find a comprehensive documentation of the administration of theses in the CIT portal.\nStudents have to be enrolled when they take an exam (including the thesis).\nIn accordance with § 18 subsection (1) APSO students must be enrolled in the respective program until completion and submission of the final thesis (Bachelor's Thesis or Master's Thesis). This is true even if the period for writing the thesis was extended for reasons beyond a student’s control.\nFor all other exams, however, the time until the first week of classes belongs to the exam period of the previous semester. Therefore, in that case, students only have to be enrolled until the end of the previous semster. For exams which take place until the end of the first week of classes of the new semester no obligation for enrollment exists. This is also true for the usually with a final thesis associated mandatory colloquium (Bachelor) or mandatory presentation (Master). Students who have submitted their final thesis in the previous semester therefore do not have to be enrolled for a colloquium or presentation which takes place until the end of the first week of classes.\nPlease note: If the colloquium or presentation takes place after submitting the final thesis and if this is the last requirement of the program, then the day of the colloquium or the presentation also is the date of the certificate (and not the date of submission of the thesis).\nPlease be sure to note this when reporting grades: When entering titles for grade reports, please ensure that the rules of capitalization are applied correctly in English: Use of English in thesis titles\nAs the data is automatically transferred from the CIT Portal, the correct spelling must be entered. Please note that both the “German title” field and the “English title” field must be filled in. If there is no German title, please also enter the English title in the “German title” field.\n• Mathematics\n• Informatics\n• Electrical & Computer Engineering\n• You can log in to the CIT portal with your TUM ID and get an overview of your thesis.\n• If necessary, you can apply for an extension in the CIT portal.\n• Further functions will follow in the coming months.",

These can be easily distinguished by the module numbers (INxxxx), which can be found in the title of each informatics course in TUMonline.\nThe same rules as for all other \"normal\" courses apply to courses and examinations that have the character of a seminar or internship, but have other module numbers than those mentioned above (e.g. Support Elective Modules IN9xxx). See also the pages on examinations.\nLog in to TUMonline and select \"Courses\" in the Study & Courses section, then select the semester. Enter the IN number of the desired course as the search term (e.g. IN0014 for Bachelor seminars, IN2107 for Master seminars, IN0012 for Bachelor practical course, IN2106 for Master practical course).\nIn some degree programs, e.g. in the Master of Informatics, it is possible to include more than one internship. Unfortunately, TUMonline cannot automatically decide where the practical course should be assigned. Therefore, the assignment is done semi-automatically by the Academic Programs Office only after the grades have been finalized.\nHowever, you have the possibility to do the assignment yourself in advance. To do this, you have to click on the checkbox in the column \"Gew\" and the line of your practical course in the curriculum under \"Master practical course -> [VK] [IN2106] Master practical course\". You will find a gray 'L' in the right line in the column \"Leist\".\nExaminations and other study achievements have to be done independent and exclusively under use of permitted aids. In the case of seminar papers and theses, but also exercises and programming exercises, it is therefore important to ensure complete and correct citations to avoid sources of plagiarism.\nTo offer our students the best education possible we support our students to avoid plagiarism and respect basic rules of citation. For this purpose we compiled a guideline.\nGuideline: Student Code of Conduct\n• Seminars for bachelor programs have the module number (IN0014) and for master programs (IN2107).\n• Practical courses for bachelor programs have the module number (IN0012) and for master programs (IN2106)\n• Practical courses for the master's program in Information Systems have the module numbers (IN2128, IN2129, IN2131)\n[GRID_TABLE]\nPractical Courses and Seminar Courses\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nThis information only applies to courses with the numbers IN0012, IN0014, IN2106, IN2107, IN2128, IN2129, IN2130, IN2131, IN2396, IN2397.

This means that no more documents need to be sent to TUM by post. All documents that previously had to be submitted as notarized copies must now be uploaded to TUMonline as authentic documents. You can find all information on document requirements for application and enrollment at TUM here.\nUsually, documents are considered authentic if they bear the signature and seal of the issuing official body, alternatively a digital seal, a verification code, or a QR code for online verification. The requirements listed below for documents from China, Georgia, or Iran continue to apply.\nTUM does not accept original documents. During the online application process, you upload digital versions of your documents. The decision about your admission is based on these files. If you receive an offer of admission, we require certified hardcopies of certain documents for enrollment, e.g. of diplomas or degree certificates. This is the only way to make sure that the files we use to evaluate an application are identical with the original documents.\nIf you receive an offer of admission and accept your study place, TUMonline will generate a list with the documents we require as certified hardcopies for enrollment\nDo not send in original degree certificates - TUM cannot assume liability for unsolicited originals. We digitalize all documents and destroy the hard copies after a period of 1 year.\nPlease make sure your notarized copies comply with the requirements described here. If they do not, we cannot accept them.\nWe only accept notarized copies with an official seal and authentic signature. A copy of an officially notarized copy, as well as scanned documents are not considered to be notarized and must be officially re-notarized. Otherwise they will not be recognized.\nPlease note that a sealed letter or envelope does not substitute a notarized copy.\nTUM only accepts notarizations issued by\nIn no case will we accept notarizations from private individuals, lawyers, a priest's office, banks, health insurance companies or the AStA (student union executive committee)!\nWe only accept notarized copies that contain all of the following stipulations:\nA document that is digitally verifiable does not need to be notarized additionally.\nThe document must contain a verification code or PIN and a link to the verification homepage. The entire content of the document must be verifiable online.\nPlease check in advance that the verification homepage is working and that the entire content of the document is displayed. It must be an official homepage of the issuing institution, which can be accessed in English or German.\nIf only a confirmation of the date of issuance is displayed online, this is not sufficient, the entire content must be verifiable online.\nFor some documents you need to contact the responsible institution (the test provider, university, etc.) to have TUM enabled for verification.\nIf the copy consists of more than one page, evidence is required that all pages belong to the same document. The following forms of notarization are possible:\nIf there are relevant copies on both the front and back of the sheet, the following forms of notarization are possible:\nIf you are already in Germany, please contact the embassy or consulate of your home country or a German notary to have your documents notarized.
