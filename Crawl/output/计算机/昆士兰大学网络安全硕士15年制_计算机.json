Knowing the costs and what support is available will help you manage your money.\nBefore you apply for university, there are some costs to consider. These include:\nFor some postgraduate coursework programs you'll pay full tuition fees.\nFor postgraduate domestic students, tuition fees are program-based. This means you'll pay the same tuition fee for each course you study in your program during one academic year.\nTuition fees increase annually. The increase is usually fixed 12 months in advance, so you can plan your finances ahead of time.\nYou can pay these fees upfront or, if you're eligible, defer them through a FEE-HELP loan.\nActual fees may be lower or higher depending on the time you take to complete a program. Fees are reviewed annually and may be higher in later years.\nSome programs also have extra costs for things like equipment or field trips. These costs are listed on the program page.\nMost postgraduate programs at UQ have Commonwealth supported places (CSPs) available for eligible students. A CSP is a place that’s partially funded by the Australian Government.\nThe Government subsidises a CSP by paying part of the fee directly to the university. The subsidy amount isn't a loan – you don’t have to pay this amount back.\nBut you’re required to pay the remainder of the fee, known as the 'student contribution amount', for each course you’re enrolled in. You can pay this fee upfront or, if you're eligible, defer it through a HECS-HELP loan.\nStudents do not need to apply separately for a CSP. Eligible students that submit a completed application by the closing date and meet the program’s entry requirements for the chosen program will automatically be considered for a CSP.\nLearn more about eligibility for CSPs\nThe following postgraduate programs are offered to domestic students on a Commonwealth-supported basis in 2025:\nStudent contributions are reviewed annually and may be higher in later years. Postgraduate programs with CSPs vary from year to year.\nYou can view the fee type for each program under the 'Fees and Scholarships' tab of each program page.\nMost Australian universities charge a compulsory Student Services and Amenities Fee (SSAF).\nThe SSAF is used to fund non-academic services for students, including sports and recreation, employment and career advice, child care and food services.\nThe maximum annual fee is $365 for 2025. This fee increases annually. The amount you have to pay will depend on whether you're an internal or external student, and whether you study full-time or part-time.\nYou can pay this fee upfront or, if you're eligible, defer it through an SA-HELP loan.\nLearn more about the Student Services and Amenities Fee (SSAF)\nUnder certain circumstances, you may have to pay additional administrative fees for things like:\nFor a full list of administrative fees, see our fee schedules.\nThere's a range of other costs you may need to pay for, including accommodation, textbooks and transport.

Our living costs guide can help you budget for common expenses.\nLearn more about the cost of living in Brisbane\nTo help you cover your costs, there's a range of financial support available, including:\nThe Higher Education Loan Program (HELP) offers several schemes to support eligible students with the cost of their education. There are 3 main schemes that support postgraduate students:\nIf you're a full-fee paying student, you may be able to use a FEE-HELP loan to cover your tuition fees.\nYou can apply for FEE-HELP if you are:\nWe'll guide you through how to apply for FEE-HELP once you've accepted an offer to study at UQ.\nThere is a limit to the combined amount you can borrow through HELP loans to cover course fees. This includes HECS-HELP loans incurred from 2020 onwards, and all existing and new FEE-HELP loans.\nIf you're accepted in a Commonwealth Supported Place, you can't use FEE-HELP – you'll need to use HECS-HELP instead.\nLearn more about FEE-HELP\nIf you're enrolled in a Commonwealth Supported Place (CSP), you may be able to use a HECS-HELP loan to cover your student contribution amount.\nTo be eligible for HECS-HELP you must be enrolled in a Commonwealth Supported Place, and be:\nWe'll guide you through how to apply for HECS-HELP once you've accepted an offer to study at UQ.\nLearn more about HECS-HELP\nSA-HELP is a loan scheme that helps students pay their Student Services and Amenities Fee.\nIf you're eligible for HECS-HELP or FEE-HELP, you'll usually also be eligible for SA-HELP. You can use SA-HELP even if you don't take out any other HELP loan.\nWe'll guide you through how to apply for SA-HELP once you've accepted an offer to study at UQ.\nLearn more about SA-HELP\nScholarships can help make your university experience more affordable. We offer more scholarships than any other university in Queensland, so it's worth taking some time to research and apply.\nApplication opening and closing dates vary, so search for scholarships as early as possible to ensure you don't miss application deadlines.\nFind a scholarship\nThe Australian Government has approved some masters programs for Centrelink income support to eligible students. Check the program page under ‘Fees and scholarships’ to find out whether the program you're interested in is approved.\nTuition fees for international students are program-based. This means you'll pay the same tuition fee for each course you study in your program during one academic year.\nTo help you estimate your costs, check our indicative fees. The list shows the average annual cost and estimated total cost of tuition fees for full-time study in each of our programs.\nNon-tuition fees are other fees you may need to pay to UQ.

I chose to further my education with a Master of Laws at UQ to broaden my legal knowledge and understanding of public, private, economic, financial and international issues. It was also important to me to explore the most recent legal developments and updates. Malaysia uses the common law system like Australia does and UQ offers several courses related to international law.\nTheresa: The Master of Laws program at UQ is highly regarded. I chose this program with the hope of broadening my understanding of different practice areas. I was impressed with the variety of subjects offered, some more related to private or public practice, as well as a number of courses that were both interesting and challenging.\nTheresa: I undertook the LLM as a part-time student. This was more than manageable while also working in a consultant role and continuing my previous activities and hobbies.\nNabilah: Because of the Malaysian Bar's rules and regulations, I had to stop practising law to pursue full-time studies. It was a difficult decision, but I believe knowledge is important and I’m excited to return to Malaysia to practise law with the new knowledge I’ve gained.\nNabilah: I graduated with a Bachelor of Laws (Honours) from a Malaysian public university in 2015 and was admitted to the Bar in July 2016. I spent my first 3 years after graduating handling personal injury claims as a legal assistant before becoming a partner of a local law practice. After deciding to study the Master of Laws at UQ, I began looking for scholarships and approached an international student services organisation to help me with my application, student visa, and more. Since English is my second language, I had to take the International English Language Testing System (IELTS). I prepared for the test while working and then once I’d passed the test, was able to start my postgraduate degree.\nTheresa: I found postgraduate study a lot more enjoyable. There are a variety of interesting subjects offered. Students are provided a lot more flexibility in terms of assessment with many subjects offering students the ability to choose a research project of choice or topic that interests them within the course structure.\nNabilah: Since it had been some time since last doing assignments, I struggled a bit with referencing and citations during my first semester. But now, I’m more comfortable with referencing and because I read the materials before class, I feel more comfortable participating. I’ve also made a lot of new friends.\nMaster of Laws (LLM) student Nabilah Mat Pozian.\nTheresa: Professor Peter Billings provided great guidance within his course Refugees, Asylum Seekers and the Law. I also enjoyed Dr Rebecca Ananian-Welsh’s course on Law, Terrorism and Human Rights. My lecturers have been very encouraging in terms of allowing us to pursue various research projects and topics within our assessment, while providing incredible guidance.\nWithin the Refugee and Immigration Law course, students were invited to review and critically reflect on artefacts – letters written by refugees held within offshore processing camps on Nauru. This was incredibly eye-opening and an absolute honour to be able to read and witness these first-hand accounts.\nNabilah: I feel like every course I’ve taken has helped me a lot in different ways. For example, The Law, Technology and Global Business helped me understand better how the law works in business with the development of technology such as bitcoin and smart contracts, electronic sale of goods and artificial intelligence.\nIn Current Issues in International Law, I learnt about the general principles of international criminal law and its procedure, responsibility to respect the laws of armed conflict/international humanitarian law, the legal frameworks for investigation and prosecution of both international and domestic atrocity crimes.\nThe International Admiralty and Maritime Law taught me the international shipping industry is relevant to most of the countries in the world, so it’s important to know laws applicable to it. I learnt about a broad range of maritime legal issues covered by numbers of international conventions, liabilities arising from incidents such as collisions at sea, salvage, wreck and marine pollution liability.\nMy favourite lecturer, Professor Craig Forrest, taught me International Admiralty and Maritime Law and Cultural Heritage Law. Both courses covered completely new material for me, and Professor Craig Forrest is good at explaining concepts to ensure all his students understand. He also shared his real-life experiences from when he was in the Navy.\nTheresa: My career goals are to continue my academic progression and pursue a research project. My research skills have greatly improved as a result of the numerous assessment items. The LLM program has further assisted with improving my drafting and critical thinking skills, which I feel have certainly crossed over into private practice. I am so glad to have pursued the LLM as it has inspired a new-found focus and dream to pursue a research project. I definitely feel more prepared and confident in applying for this next challenge.\nNabilah: I’m still studying, but I know already the courses I’ve completed will enhance my career. For example, I’ve learnt the importance of mediation to save time for all parties involved in the dispute and to produce a 'win-win' outcome for all. I will certainly apply this knowledge and new skills when mediating clients in the future.\nNabilah: It’s important to be passionate and eager to learn new things but remember it’s okay not to know everything. If you’re an international student, it’s also a good idea to do some research on how to live in a foreign country before you make the move.\nTheresa: If you have been thinking about pursuing further study, it is an enjoyable and meaningful challenge.\nMaster of Laws (LLM) graduate Theresa Shaw.\nLet’s take a look at the facts.
