Through this programme, students will acquire essential knowledge and practical skills for developing novel solutions, services or products to help further promote Hong Kong's development in innovation and technology.The MSc(Eng)(IDT) has an interdisciplinary curriculum by drawing on the expertise from diverse areas of engineering with a technology focus. In additional to learning general knowledge on innovative design and manufacturing, students can customise a personal portfolio to meet their particular needs of an in depth knowledge, interests and career goals in different areas. Besides, students will be required to complete an interdisciplinary capstone project to discover how to apply technologies to solve practical problems. The programme responds to the emerging needs for talents who can create and apply technologies for solving various types of problems, and realise the invention for the benefit of mankind.Graduates will take up leading roles in making change in the world and make impact in Hong Kong as well as other parts of the world.Students are required to complete 48 credits plus a dissertation (equivalent to 24 credits) to graduate.\n\n\nEntrance Requirements\n\n1.

The programme's content includes mechanical design, programming, and integration skills for building, operating, and applying robotic systems. The programme also emphasizes teamwork and collaboration, preparing students for the many tasks necessary to accomplish these goals. Upon graduation, students are well-prepared to become independent researchers and engineers, and many will go on to become leaders in robotics research in both academia and industry.The curriculum is designed with fundamental courses; elective courses; capstone project and networking opportunities.The fundamental courses provide candidates opportunity to explore the foundations of robotic systems, including robot modelling, sensing, planning, control, intelligence, and integration in our comprehensive core curriculum. Elective courses are designed to tailor students' education to their interests with elective modules such as Human-Robot Interaction, Autonomous Vehicles, Healthcare Robots, Internet of Things, and Machine Learning. Capstone project allows candidates to apply their skills and knowledge to a collaborative, industry-driven capstone project, addressing real-world challenges and developing innovative solutions. Networking opportunities are provided for candidates to engage with leading experts, entrepreneurs,   researchers, and professionals in the field through guest lectures, industry visits, career talks, and extra-curriculum enrichment activities.Students are required to successfully complete 72 credits to graduate. The mode of study may comprise 48 credits of courses plus a dissertation (equivalent to 24 credits) or 60 credits of courses plus a project (equivalent to 12 credits).\n\n\nEntrance Requirements\n\n1. Comply with the University Entrance Requirements; and2. Hold a Bachelor's degree in engineering or a related field, with a strong interest in robotics.3. Evidence of motivation and potential for success in the programme, as demonstrated through a personal statement, transcripts, and CV.\n\n\n\nDownload Documents\n\r\n                                        For additional information, we recommend reviewing the following documents:\r\n                                    \n\nAdditional Information\n\nPDF Document\r\n                                        \n\n\nRegulations & Syllabuses\n\nPDF Document\r\n                                        \n\n\nSupporting Documents\n\nPDF Document\r\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFaculty\nFaculty of Engineering\n\r\n                                            The Faculty of Engineering is one of the founding faculties of The University of Hong Kong established in 1912, is among the largest and most comprehensive engineering faculties in Hong Kong.

Microelectronics and semiconductor industry are highly specialized with cutting-edge materials, processes, and sciences heavily involved. Our programme is to provide comprehensive knowledge and hands-on training to educate future microelectronics talents for the strong demand from the industrial sectors in this area. An in-depth, well-balanced, and multidisciplinary knowledge across various aspects of the whole value chain will greatly enhance students' capability of grasping future business opportunities as engineers, managers, and entrepreneurs.Students will acquire essential knowledge to understand key science in semiconductor devices and their manufacturing processes, fundamental skills in microelectronic device design, hands-on training on designing and implementing fabrication processes for semiconductor devices, etc. Students will also have opportunities to gain valuable 'Experiential Learning' opportunities through 'hands-on' projects.Students are required to complete 48 credits plus a dissertation (equivalent to 24 credits) to graduate.\n\n\nEntrance Requirements\n\n1.

It has continually evolved to incorporate advancement in science and technology of multi-disciplinary applications such as advanced materials, energy and biomedical. In response to these changing needs of mechanical engineering, the Master of Science in Engineering in Mechanical Engineering [MSc(Eng)(ME)] curriculum is designed for enabling postgraduate students to develop a wider perspective and a deeper understanding of the many contemporary issues facing mechanical-engineering professionals.The MSc(Eng)(ME) curriculum provides a range of technical courses and learning experience in the fields of energy and power, environmental engineering, material technology, applied mathematics, computational fluid dynamics, theoretical mechanics, and computer integrated design and manufacturing. Students will integrate and apply the knowledge acquired from their studies for solving the deeper problems that may arise in the broad field of mechanical engineering. By learning new theories and developing engineering techniques to investigate the emerging problems in mechanical engineering, students can eventually become engineering professionals.Students are required to complete 48 credits plus a dissertation (equivalent to 24 credits) to graduate.\n\n\nEntrance Requirements\n\n1. Comply with the University Entrance Requirements; and2. Hold a Bachelor's degree of this University in a relevant field; or a qualification of equivalent standard from this University or another comparable institution accepted for this purpose.\n\n\n\nDownload Documents\n\r\n                                        For additional information, we recommend reviewing the following documents:\r\n                                    \n\nAdditional Information\n\nPDF Document\r\n                                        \n\n\nRegulations & Syllabuses\n\nPDF Document\r\n                                        \n\n\nSupporting Documents\n\nPDF Document\r\n                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFaculty\nFaculty of Engineering\n\r\n                                            The Faculty of Engineering is one of the founding faculties of The University of Hong Kong established in 1912, is among the largest and most comprehensive engineering faculties in Hong Kong.
