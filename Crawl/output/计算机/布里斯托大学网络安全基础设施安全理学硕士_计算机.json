There is worldwide demand for new and innovative approaches to tackling global cyber threats specific to large-scale infrastructures, from energy production to finance through to healthcare and smart transportation. The cyber security of such infrastructures is paramount – their disruption can have large-scale impacts on society as well as massive business losses. There is a major shortage of cyber security professionals globally, and the specialist nature of critical infrastructures makes the problem even more acute.\nA strong ethos of rigorous experimental and empirical cyber security research underpins the MSc, facilitated by a state-of-the-art testbed for studying critical national infrastructure (CNI) and Internet of Things (IoT) security, and bespoke teaching equipment. You'll learn to apply foundational cyber security techniques to infrastructure and will develop the skills for engineering scalable solutions. You'll be exposed to real-world problems that are practical and challenge-oriented, but underpinned by rigorous research.\nThis MSc aims to:\nWe also offer a related programme in Cyber Security (Software Security).\nHear directly from an academic giving you a deeper insight into this programme.\nThe MSc consists of the following compulsory units:\nTo complete your studies you will undertake an individual research project proposed by project supervisors. This unit will provide you with first-hand experience in planning, running, documenting, and presenting a substantial piece of original work in the field of cyber security of infrastructures. This will typically include reading and synthesising academic literature, developing a hypothesis and validating it through hands-on experimental or implementation work. The projects offered each year will vary and each will have a different focus under the overarching umbrella of Infrastructures Security.\nThe units are taught in intensive week-long blocks. Part-time study will require daytime attendance on campus for the full week when a unit is being taught.\nVisit our programme catalogue for full details of the structure and unit content for our MSc Cyber Security (Infrastructures Security).\nThe University of Bristol is ranked fifth for research in the UK (Times Higher Education).\n94% of our research assessed as world-leading or internationally excellent.\nYou will typically need an upper second-class honours degree or international equivalent in Computer Science, Electrical or Electronic Engineering, Cyber Security, Network Security or Information Security. Other disciplines will be considered on a case-by-case basis.\nApplicants from other related subjects are required to have studied modules relevant to the programme at minimum of 60%, or international equivalent:\nRelevant Modules:\nSuitable Programming modules(one module from this list):\nMATLAB, FORTRAN, Basic or Visual Basic will not be considered suitable for this programme.\nWe will also consider your application if your final achieved grade is slightly lower than the programme's entry requirements, if you have at least one of the following:\nIf this is the case, please include your CV (curriculum vitae / résumé) when you apply, showing details of your relevant qualifications.\nSee international equivalent qualifications on the International Office website.\nRead the programme admissions statement for important information on entry requirements, the application process and supporting documents required.\nIf English is not your first language, you will need to reach the requirements outlined in our profile level D.\nFurther information about English language requirements and profile levels.\nFees are subject to an annual review. For programmes that last longer than one year, please budget for up to an 8% increase in fees each year.\nMore about tuition fees, living costs and financial support.\nUniversity of Bristol students and graduates can benefit from a 25% reduction in tuition fees for postgraduate study. Check your eligibility for an alumni discount.\nFurther information on funding for prospective UK and international postgraduate students.\nThis programme is informed by the skills gap identified by industry. Following graduation from this MSc, students will have the opportunity to play a fundamental role in delivering cyber security on a large scale through their careers. Graduates may find roles in network security, Industrial Control Systems Security and Operational Technology, and will be capable of critically evaluating and synthesising research literature, developing and deploying systems, and communicating with others in their field and other disciplines. Top graduates from this degree will be able to proactively advance the development of infrastructures security or move on to doctoral studies in cyber security.\nApply via our online application system.

We refer to these skill levels as ‘profiles’. The profile for your chosen course or programme is shown on the course page or programme page.\nThe tests and levels you need to achieve to meet the requirements are on each English language profile page.\nEnglish language proficiency tests should be obtained within two years of the start date of your programme or course.\nIf you are from, or have studied in, an English-speaking country, you may not need to provide additional evidence of your English language ability.\nEnglish language qualifications must be presented in English. If the qualification evidence is not in English you must provide a professional or certified translation, including the contact details for the translator or translation company.\nYou do not need to have reached the required level before you apply.\nWe will look at your academic qualifications and decide what offer we will make you. If you haven’t yet reached the required English level, we will give you a target grade to meet as part of your offer.\nIf you have the required level, you must include it in your application. You do not need to do anything else. If you are a national of an English-speaking country as defined by UK Visas and Immigration, then you may be considered to have the required level. You can find further details, including the list of these countries, in each of our English language profiles.\nIf you haven’t reached the required level for your course or programme, you will be given a target grade in your offer.\nYou will need to provide a valid English language qualification showing you have met the required target grade.\nIf you don’t have the required level, you can try one of the following:\n• Taking a pre-sessional language course offered by the University\n• Taking an IELTS Academic test\n• Taking a different course in your home country which qualifies (see the list under the profile)\n• Re-sitting the language tests in your home country to reach the required level.",
