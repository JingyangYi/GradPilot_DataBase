Knowing the costs and what support is available will help you manage your money.\nBefore you apply for university, there are some costs to consider. These include:\nFor some postgraduate coursework programs you'll pay full tuition fees.\nFor postgraduate domestic students, tuition fees are program-based. This means you'll pay the same tuition fee for each course you study in your program during one academic year.\nTuition fees increase annually. The increase is usually fixed 12 months in advance, so you can plan your finances ahead of time.\nYou can pay these fees upfront or, if you're eligible, defer them through a FEE-HELP loan.\nActual fees may be lower or higher depending on the time you take to complete a program. Fees are reviewed annually and may be higher in later years.\nSome programs also have extra costs for things like equipment or field trips. These costs are listed on the program page.\nMost postgraduate programs at UQ have Commonwealth supported places (CSPs) available for eligible students. A CSP is a place that’s partially funded by the Australian Government.\nThe Government subsidises a CSP by paying part of the fee directly to the university. The subsidy amount isn't a loan – you don’t have to pay this amount back.\nBut you’re required to pay the remainder of the fee, known as the 'student contribution amount', for each course you’re enrolled in. You can pay this fee upfront or, if you're eligible, defer it through a HECS-HELP loan.\nStudents do not need to apply separately for a CSP. Eligible students that submit a completed application by the closing date and meet the program’s entry requirements for the chosen program will automatically be considered for a CSP.\nLearn more about eligibility for CSPs\nThe following postgraduate programs are offered to domestic students on a Commonwealth-supported basis in 2025:\nStudent contributions are reviewed annually and may be higher in later years. Postgraduate programs with CSPs vary from year to year.\nYou can view the fee type for each program under the 'Fees and Scholarships' tab of each program page.\nMost Australian universities charge a compulsory Student Services and Amenities Fee (SSAF).\nThe SSAF is used to fund non-academic services for students, including sports and recreation, employment and career advice, child care and food services.\nThe maximum annual fee is $365 for 2025. This fee increases annually. The amount you have to pay will depend on whether you're an internal or external student, and whether you study full-time or part-time.\nYou can pay this fee upfront or, if you're eligible, defer it through an SA-HELP loan.\nLearn more about the Student Services and Amenities Fee (SSAF)\nUnder certain circumstances, you may have to pay additional administrative fees for things like:\nFor a full list of administrative fees, see our fee schedules.\nThere's a range of other costs you may need to pay for, including accommodation, textbooks and transport.

Our living costs guide can help you budget for common expenses.\nLearn more about the cost of living in Brisbane\nTo help you cover your costs, there's a range of financial support available, including:\nThe Higher Education Loan Program (HELP) offers several schemes to support eligible students with the cost of their education. There are 3 main schemes that support postgraduate students:\nIf you're a full-fee paying student, you may be able to use a FEE-HELP loan to cover your tuition fees.\nYou can apply for FEE-HELP if you are:\nWe'll guide you through how to apply for FEE-HELP once you've accepted an offer to study at UQ.\nThere is a limit to the combined amount you can borrow through HELP loans to cover course fees. This includes HECS-HELP loans incurred from 2020 onwards, and all existing and new FEE-HELP loans.\nIf you're accepted in a Commonwealth Supported Place, you can't use FEE-HELP – you'll need to use HECS-HELP instead.\nLearn more about FEE-HELP\nIf you're enrolled in a Commonwealth Supported Place (CSP), you may be able to use a HECS-HELP loan to cover your student contribution amount.\nTo be eligible for HECS-HELP you must be enrolled in a Commonwealth Supported Place, and be:\nWe'll guide you through how to apply for HECS-HELP once you've accepted an offer to study at UQ.\nLearn more about HECS-HELP\nSA-HELP is a loan scheme that helps students pay their Student Services and Amenities Fee.\nIf you're eligible for HECS-HELP or FEE-HELP, you'll usually also be eligible for SA-HELP. You can use SA-HELP even if you don't take out any other HELP loan.\nWe'll guide you through how to apply for SA-HELP once you've accepted an offer to study at UQ.\nLearn more about SA-HELP\nScholarships can help make your university experience more affordable. We offer more scholarships than any other university in Queensland, so it's worth taking some time to research and apply.\nApplication opening and closing dates vary, so search for scholarships as early as possible to ensure you don't miss application deadlines.\nFind a scholarship\nThe Australian Government has approved some masters programs for Centrelink income support to eligible students. Check the program page under ‘Fees and scholarships’ to find out whether the program you're interested in is approved.\nTuition fees for international students are program-based. This means you'll pay the same tuition fee for each course you study in your program during one academic year.\nTo help you estimate your costs, check our indicative fees. The list shows the average annual cost and estimated total cost of tuition fees for full-time study in each of our programs.\nNon-tuition fees are other fees you may need to pay to UQ.

The staff are dedicated to opening up opportunities for all the students – you just need to be brave enough to show your interest!\nSandra: I enjoyed the technical courses the most, where I learnt new programming languages such as Python and R, and the visualisation techniques in Power BI and Tableau. All my teachers were very helpful and supportive, and they were always available to listen to the students' feedback.\nKyara: The Responsible AI course stands out. This course probed me to think about the ethical and societal impacts of technological improvements. This challenged me in a way I have never been challenged before. I quite enjoyed it.\nSandra: During my first year, I used to stress a lot about completing assignments and modules. Over time, became better at managing my time to handle both while still carrying out other duties.\nRae: My first semester of postgrad was a lot of what I was used to – attending 4 courses and completing a range of assessment pieces.\n“Now, a lot more of my time is allocated to my research project that I designed. I’m really enjoying that freedom to dictate where my research goes.”\nSandra: I work in the School of Agriculture and Food Sustainability at UQ (Science Faculty). I work with academics and researchers and help them build tools for data collection, management and analysis, for specific research projects.\nI am currently working on a project funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation which aims to reduce hunger and poverty in developing countries (SDG2) by helping their National Agriculture Centres improve their breeding programs of staple crops such as wheat, maize, cassava and rice.\nA few of my daily duties include cleaning data received from our stakeholders, merging data in a repository, making changes to the data collection tool as suggested by the project leader, writing reports, updating Power BI dashboards, and coordinating data dissemination.\nKyara: I work at Shell Energy Australia as a senior business analyst. Each day is different. The best part of my day is defining a problem clearly with a stakeholder and ideating the solution with the team.\nDiscover other ways you could help businesses discover insights from their data with the knowledge you gain from a Master of Business Analytics.\nKyara: I have been able to apply the knowledge, methodologies and approaches I have learnt to my day-to-day activities. This knowledge has helped me improve my confidence when delivering work and engaging stakeholders.\nSandra: The degree is helping me explore new ways to analyse and interpret the data I work with.\nWhat I find most rewarding in my job is discovering new insights in the data we collect from our stakeholders and knowing that my work is helping improve the livelihoods of people in developing countries.\nSandra’s pro tip for Master of Business Analytics students is to attend the live online sessions of lectures when possible (rather than watching the recordings), as this is the best place to ask questions.\nRae: The interdisciplinary focus that involves students from a range of different areas.\nKyara: It was my dream to study at a prestigious university like UQ.

I quite enjoyed it.\nWhat’s your study load like as a business analytics postgraduate student?\nSandra: During my first year, I used to stress a lot about completing assignments and modules. Over time, became better at managing my time to handle both while still carrying out other duties.\nWhat’s it like to study cyber security as a postgrad, in comparison to your experience of undergraduate study?\nRae: My first semester of postgrad was a lot of what I was used to – attending 4 courses and completing a range of assessment pieces.\n\n“Now, a lot more of my time is allocated to my research project that I designed. I’m really enjoying that freedom to dictate where my research goes.”\n\nWhat kinds of Master of Business Analytics job opportunities are out there?\nSandra: I work in the School of Agriculture and Food Sustainability at UQ (Science Faculty). I work with academics and researchers and help them build tools for data collection, management and analysis, for specific research projects.\nI am currently working on a project funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation which aims to reduce hunger and poverty in developing countries (SDG2) by helping their National Agriculture Centres improve their breeding programs of staple crops such as wheat, maize, cassava and rice.\nA few of my daily duties include cleaning data received from our stakeholders, merging data in a repository, making changes to the data collection tool as suggested by the project leader, writing reports, updating Power BI dashboards, and coordinating data dissemination.\nKyara: I work at Shell Energy Australia as a senior business analyst. Each day is different. The best part of my day is defining a problem clearly with a stakeholder and ideating the solution with the team.\n\nDiscover other ways you could help businesses discover insights from their data with the knowledge you gain from a Master of Business Analytics.\n\nSo, is a master’s in business analytics worth it?\nKyara: I have been able to apply the knowledge, methodologies and approaches I have learnt to my day-to-day activities. This knowledge has helped me improve my confidence when delivering work and engaging stakeholders.\nSandra: The degree is helping me explore new ways to analyse and interpret the data I work with.\nWhat I find most rewarding in my job is discovering new insights in the data we collect from our stakeholders and knowing that my work is helping improve the livelihoods of people in developing countries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSandra’s pro tip for Master of Business Analytics students is to attend the live online sessions of lectures when possible (rather than watching the recordings), as this is the best place to ask questions. \n\nWhy did you choose UQ for your postgraduate studies?\nRae: The interdisciplinary focus that involves students from a range of different areas.\nKyara: It was my dream to study at a prestigious university like UQ. So, when the opportunity arose, I grabbed it.\n\nDoes UQ offer the best postgraduate programs in data, analytics and cyber security?\nLet’s take a look at the facts:\n\nUQ is #1 in Queensland for computer science, according to Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2025\nUQ is #1 in Queensland for computer science and information systems, according to QS World University Rankings by Subject 2025.\n\n\nHow can you study data, analytics and cyber security as a postgrad at UQ?\nThere are a variety of ways you can delve into the fascinating area of data, analytics and cyber security at UQ.
