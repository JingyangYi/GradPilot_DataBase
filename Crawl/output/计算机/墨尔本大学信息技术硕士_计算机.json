To learn about spatial information, study digital infrastructure engineering.\nEverything that happens, happens somewhere. How does your uber know where to drop you off? How do we know that a building can withstand a changing climate? How can we get supplies to people during natural disaster or keep track of a bushfire? Using spatial data, we can monitor the world around us to design sustainable buildings, smart cities and use autonomous vehicles to work more efficiently.\nStudying digital infrastructure engineering teaches you spatial information skills in mapping and visualisation, geographic information systems (GIS) used for programs like Google Maps and satellite image processing.\nOur digital infrastructure engineering programs are designed with industry leaders so you’re studying the skills that employers are looking for and will be guided leading academics who are researching disaster management, smart cities and mobility, land management and surveying.\nThe University of Melbourne offers over 270 degrees in a vast range of study areas and specialisations. Browse through the programs we offer in the study area of your choice.\nA major is your chosen area of specialisation.

This applies even if you're studying abroad or have dual Australian citizenship.\nEntry points offer varying study durations and admission criteria based on the relevance of your prior studies.\nMeeting the published entry requirements for this course does not guarantee selection.\nWhere our admission criteria includes a minimum Weighted Average Mark (WAM) and/or specific subject criteria, these are based on University of Melbourne grades and subjects. If you've studied elsewhere, we'll assess your relevant prior studies and equivalent grades. Your final WAM may be adjusted depending on your previous institution's accreditation, subject grading, and pass marks.\nYou may have the option to enrol in specific single subjects through the University's Community Access Program, even if you are not enrolled in a course. Completing these prerequisite subjects may qualify you for entry into this course. This option is not available to student visa holders or applicants. Learn more about single subject study.\nYou can use our graduate coursework grade conversion eligibility calculator to get an indication of whether you are eligible for this course based on your previous studies and Weighted Average Mark (WAM).\nAll applicants to the University of Melbourne must satisfy the English language requirements. This may be achieved in a number of ways, including recognised previous study taught and assessed entirely in English or an approved English language test. If you are from a non-English speaking background, the required standard of English for this degree is one of the following English proficiency test scores:\nIf you need to undertake an English language test, you must meet one of the scores* below:\nWhen assessing applications, the Selection Committee will consider your previous studies and academic performance.\nThe Selection Committee may request additional information to clarify any aspect of an application, according to the University’s Academic Board rules regarding selection instruments.\nIf relevant to your application, the Selection Committee will also consider your professional experience.\nIf you are applying on the basis of relevant work experience, your application must include documentary evidence (such as a letter from your current or previous employer on letterhead) that confirms the nature of the work, its duration, its full-time or part-time status and your position or role. This documentary evidence must be an original or original certified copy.\nWe encourage domestic students to explore eligibility for Graduate Access Melbourne (GAM). GAM offers an opportunity for admission to this course even if your tertiary marks are below the standard entry requirements. GAM applicants may also be considered for financial bursaries and Commonwealth Supported Places (CSPs) where available.\nGAM categories include coming from a rural area, being an Indigenous Australian, experiencing financial hardship or personal difficulties, having refugee status, or living with a disability or medical condition. In assessing applications, we look to balance opportunity and your capacity to succeed.\nPrior studies may be credited towards your degree and potentially reduce the duration of your course.
