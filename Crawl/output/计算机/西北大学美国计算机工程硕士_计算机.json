Can I get an application fee waiver?\n[HEADING] More in this section\n[HEADING] Related Links\n[HEADING] Contact Info\n[HEADING] Request More Information\nIn the following, we provide answers to some frequently asked questions (FAQ). If there are issues that are not addressed here, please contact the ECE Graduate Affairs Office.\nJump to a Section\nWe receive hundreds of requests weekly, so regrettably, we cannot assess an applicant's individual chances. If you feel strongly about your qualifications, we encourage you to apply.\nReturn to Top\nApplicants pursuing a doctoral degree should select the PhD option. Students pursuing a PhD may also obtain a Master's degree during their doctoral career at Northwestern University. You should select the MS option ONLY if you are seeking a terminal Master's degree. Note that no financial aid is offered to those seeking the terminal MS degree.\nReturn to Top\nThere is no separate financial aid application. Financial aid, including tuition and stipend, is offered to all admitted doctoral students; no financial aid is offered to terminal Master's students. However, there are several loan options available and as a graduate student you will be eligible for Federal Direct Student Loans. You are invited to email the Evanston Office of Graduate Financial Aid for counsel about your eligibility.\nPlease feel free to follow up with the  The Evanston Office of Graduate Financial Aid if you have questions about financing your MS degree. Visit the The Evanston Office of Graduate Financial Aid website for more information about tuition, fees, billing and payment information. Learn about student student loans, Northwestern loan procedures, deadlines, downloadable forms, and private outside scholarship assistance.\nIf your ultimate goal is to pursue a PhD, please keep in mind that you may enter PhD programs without having completed an MS degree. If financial aid is not required, please include a separate letter, with your application materials, stating that you do not need aid, and briefly describing the source of your support.\nReturn to Top\nYou are required to take the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), the International English Language Testing System (IELTS), or the Michigan English Test (MET). The Graduate School considers 550 to be the minimum acceptable paper-based TOEFL score, 213 to be the minimum acceptable computer-based TOEFL score, 90 to be the minimum acceptable internet-based TOEFL score, or 7 to be the minimum acceptable IELTS score for both MS and PhD applicants. For the MET test, The Graduate School considers 61 to be the minimum acceptable score for PhD applicants and 54 for Master's applicants. To be eligible for a teaching assistantship, international applicants must submit an official Test of Spoken English (TSE) score of at least 50 or score at least 26 on the TOEFL speaking section.\nReturn to Top\nThe institution code for Northwestern University is 1565 for both exams, though a GRE score is not required for admission. For TOEFL, the department code for The Graduate School is 01.\nReturn to Top\nWe will still give full consideration to your application and evaluate it in the context of the current batch of applicants. However, be advised that if we admit you, the lack of background cannot be used as an excuse for poor performance in your class(es) projects and/or tests. You are more than welcome to take some of our 200-level courses that are pre-requisite(s) for the 300-level courses as part of your graduate education with us; however, the credits earned in those 200-level courses cannot be counted toward your degree. For foreign students: although the 200-level courses' credits do not count toward the degree requirements, they do count toward maintaining your immigration status in a good standing. In other words, since foreign students are expected to be registered for a minimum of three courses per quarter, it is fine if some of those courses are at 200-level.\nReturn to Top\nThere are some courses that are considered core curriculum. Such courses are at 200-level and cannot be counted for graduate credits; however, they need to be taken since they are pre-requisites for many of the graduate-level courses. They will be considered as background-deficiency and any incoming student who has not taken equivalent course, will have to take them early in the MS career.\nFor example, ELEC_ENG/EECS 222 is a pre-requisite for many courses in our EE major. As such, any student who does not have an equivalent course will need to take it as a deficiency.\nReturn to Top\nNo, the ECE department does not offer evening classes for graduate students. However, there are evening and/or weekend options at Northwestern: School of Professional Studies offers a Master's Degree in Computing and Information Systems (MSCIS), obtainable by taking evening and weekend courses, and working professionals can earn a Master's in Information Technology (MSIT) in two years of Saturdays\nReturn to Top\nYou must first be accepted by the university before any visa work can begin. International students can learn about the visa process for newly admitted students at the Northwestern University International Office website.\nReturn to Top\nThe very first step after receiving a notification from is for you to enter your decision (accept or decline our admission offer). Please check Admission Decision & Enrollment for a more detailed guidance.\nReturn to Top\nStudents who pursue research under the MS Thesis or MS Project tracks can speak with their research advisor about potentially continuing their research in the PhD program. However, there is no direct transfer to the PhD program. All MS students must apply to the PhD program as new applicants during the application timeline. There is absolutely no guarantee of admission into the PhD program, as this is determined on an individual basis and it is dependent upon different factors, such as funding, capacity, research objectives, etc.  If your aspiration is to obtain a PhD degree, it is recommended that you apply to the PhD program directly.\nReturn to Top\nUnfortunately, we cannot offer application fee waivers for international students at this time. This policy is in effect across all programs governed by The Graduate School (TGS).\nReturn to Top\nGraduate Student Affairs Phone: 847-467-2165 Fax: 847-491-4455  Hours: 8:30-5, M-F Location: Tech L359 Email Graduate Student Affairs\n• The application fee is expensive, and I don't want to apply if my chances aren't good.

They were all eager to teach me everything and really embraced me as part of the team. It was amazing how quickly they brought me up to speed and taught me how everything worked. It felt like I was truly a member of the team.”\n“\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIt [co-op] exposed me to two different sides of my major and narrowed down what I want to do in my future career. I was able to experience both the research side of my major, biomedical engineering, and also the research and development for medical devices. I got to see two different doors. Essentially, that helped me narrow down what I want to do in the future.”\n“\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI built a lot of connections in the industry. It’s a lot easier to do that once you’re inside than from the outside. Having almost a year of experience comes in handy. You really build more meaningful connections in a co-op experience because they are really invested in watching you grow.”\n“\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBeing in a data analyst co-op helped me see what the role actually means and how to be responsible. I think that part is really important. Also, I connected with very amazing coworkers and supervisors.”\n“\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCo-ops presented a really interesting option as I started to look at internships, because you stay at a company longer. The projects you work on are bigger in scope and can last for months, rather than just 10 weeks.”\n“\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tParticipating in co-ops has helped me understand the meaning of my courses a lot better. It helped me see why what I was learning in school was important.”\nWe augment the analytical core of engineering with design, entrepreneurship, leadership, personal development, and unusual collaborations to imagine what's next and take the world in a whole new direction.Learn More\n• TueSep 23Grad Career Lab: Resume Strategies\n• WedSep 24Grad Career Lab: Resume Strategies\n• FriSep 26Northwestern 2025 Tech Career Fair\n• TueSep 30Grad Career Lab: Career Fair + Networking\n[CARD]\nCooperative Engineering Education Program (Co-op)Co-op is an educational program which allows engineering students to alternate periods of academic study with full-time periods of paid work experience related to their academic and professional goals.Explore Co-ops\n[CARD]\nInternshipsInternships offered by the Office of Career Development offer students opportunities to gain practical work experience with employers in industry, commerce, or government.Explore Internships\n[CARD]\nResearch ExperienceStudents who are interested in career paths in research and academia have the opportunity to engage in a formal engineering research experience, either at a university (including Northwestern University) or a government laboratory.Explore Research\n[CARD]\nService LearningThe Projects in Service Learning program offers students have the opportunity to volunteer their time and engineering skills for non-profit organizations.Explore Service Learning\n[CARD]\nConnect with McCormick career advisors, events, and resources\nUse McCormickConnect to view and sign up for ECD events and interviews, schedule appointments with your ECD career advisor, view job listings, and report co-op or internship positions for work-integrated learning.Explore McCormickConnect\n[CARD]\nLook for work and register for Northwestern career events\nHandshake is the central career services platform managed by Northwestern Career Advancement.

Thus, the admission process is highly selective and competitive. Details on the process are outlined in the sections below and in the Graduate Application FAQ.\nAdmissions FAQ Start your application\nJump to a Section\nApplications for the 2025-2026 academic year will open on September 10, 2024. More information can be found on The Graduate School's admissions page.\nThe deadline for Fall 2025 PhD applicants is December 15, 2024. Most offers of admission are typically finalized by the end of March, but some decisions may be made as late as April 15.\nThe deadline for Fall 2025 MS applicants is July 21, 2025.\nView application information and deadlines for the ECE-affiliated Master of Science in Information Technology (MSIT) program here.\nReturn to Top\nThere are no paper application forms for either admission or financial aid.\nTo apply for admission to the ECE department, go to The Graduate School (TGS) website, follow the link to \"Admission,” and then finally \"Apply Online\"\nReturn to Top\nTGS's online application form will ask you to select either the PhD or MS option for Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering. If you want to pursue a PhD, with or without a Master's degree, select the PhD option. The MS option is for terminal Master's degree seekers only and does not constitute admission to further work toward a PhD.\nIt will also ask you to enter either EE or CE for the Area of Specialization. Your specialization should be chosen based on the research areas that best fit your current interests. If you need guidance, please contact Randy Freeman (EE) or Jie Gu (CE).\nChoose your research area(s) among the research interest groups within the two academic divisions: Electrical Engineering or Computer Engineering.\nYou may have more than one area of interest among the research interest groups; we recommend that you give more detail in your Statement of Purpose. For example, a student who would like to pursue research in \"wireless networks\" might select the Signals and Systems group and/or the Computer Engineering group. We also recommend that you list one or more faculty members that you would be interested in in working with. You may view the ECE faculty and their research areas here.\nReturn to Top\nBefore you apply online, gather the following:\n**For the Fall 2025 admissions cycle, the GRE will not be required for MS or PhD applicants. **\nDuring the evaluation process, your test scores (TOEFL or IELTS) will be verified directly with the testing agency. Upon admission, you will be required to provide the original transcript(s). An applicant may not be admitted without a complete application. All primary and supplemental materials must be submitted to render a decision to admit. Denials may be made due to incomplete applications.\nReturn to Top\nA typical applicant is expected to have a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering, or a related discipline from a recognized institution. Highly qualified candidates with other academic backgrounds may also be considered.\nThe specific undergraduate preparation required for graduate study depends on the program and the area of specialization. An applicant who has insufficient undergraduate preparation in any particular area but is well-qualified in every other respect may be required to take certain undergraduate courses as soon as possible after enrolling at Northwestern. That student would be informed of such a requirement at the time of admission.​\nReturn to Top\nMS and PhD applicants should apply to begin only in fall quarters; ECE only allows for fall admits to both programs. Winter and spring quarter admission requests by MS and PhD applicants will generally be denied.\nThe only mechanism for winter or spring quarter PhD admission involves the intervention of one of our faculty, who must agree to support the student in question as a research assistant for the remainder of the academic year. To explore this possibility, an applicant should contact individual professors listed in the department's faculty directory.\nYou can view a great deal of general information about requirements and policies on The Graduate School website. For more info, please contact the ECE Graduate Office.\nReturn to Top\nThe required minimum scores for both MS and PhD students: 90 IBT (Internet-based test), 233 CBT (computer-based test), and 577 PBT (paper-based test).\nLearn more about TOEFL requirements\nReturn to Top\nWe understand that proceeding with the application process for graduate studies is not an easy decision or something that should be considered lightly. To help you in making up your mind and give you some hints regarding the overall evaluation criteria, we provide a discussion of some of the relevant issues below.\nWe do receive applications with transcripts using different GPA scales (10.0; 100%; etc.) and we apply the adjusted criteria to such scales. Hence, applicants do not need to provide any conversions and should leave their GPA in their institutions' standard scales. As another specific example, many of the universities from India have a \"class-based\" evaluation scheme, and we note that we will always give priority to \"First Class with Distinction\" applicants. The application process does allow you to write the \"self-reported\" GPA on the scale of 4.0; however, we will always use the transcripts during evaluation process.\nTest score requirements from The Graduate School\nPrimarily for PhD applicants, an ECE faculty interested in advising may conduct separate interviews for further informal assessment of applicants.\nThis part of the overall application carries an extremely important weight, and the ones that are written in a clear and focused manner will be favored. Upon reading, a faculty evaluator should get a crisp idea of:\nIn each case, a successful applicant will provide a good balance between background, vision, and desiderata.\nExample: simply saying that you like Northwestern or you have a high esteem for the faculty in ECE, aside from being flattering, is not a statement that, in itself, will \"sell well.”\nLastly, while this may not always be possible, it will be helpful if at least parts of the recommendation letters can back up the claims made in the statement of purpose.\nIn the online application system each applicant will be given the option to choose in order of preference among different Programs of Study in our department. Faculty examine applications in their respective areas; therefore, every applicant should carefully examine every faculty member's research interests. Furthermore, applicants will be asked to provide names of specific faculty members who they would like to study under. This is highly recommended and useful for identifying candidates to consider.\nA minimum of three letters is required. It is a common expectation that students be willing to waive the right to view their letters without question. Waiving the right to view your letters means that they will only be available for review by the schools to which you apply. Admission committees prefer applicants waive their rights to view their letters because they recognize that recommenders tend to write more meaningful letters under these circumstances.\nA PhD applicant may also request that her or his file be considered for a self-funded Master’s degree if they are not admitted to the PhD Program. Questions about the two-application process should be referred to Elizabeth Rentfro, Business Administrator, Office of the Dean.\nWe will value all your achievements (e.g. awards received on competitions) and experiences (e.g. research projects and leadership). However, the best place to put them in a coherent manner is your resume. Ideally, some of these items should also be properly linked with the statement of purpose document.\nReturn to Top\nPlease consult our Graduate Admissions FAQ if you have more questions, or continue on to Financial Aid, Assistantships, & Fellowships.\nNorthwestern University does not make decisions related to admissions, including but not limited to financial aid and scholarships, based upon any category protected by the law. The University is committed to complying with all applicable laws. The University believes different perspectives, experiences, and backgrounds are critical to building a dynamic student body, and as such encourages all qualified applicants to apply.\nGraduate Student Affairs Phone: 847-467-2165 Fax: 847-491-4455  Hours: 8-4, M-F Location: Tech L359 Email Graduate Student Affairs\n• Application Deadlines and Important Dates\n• How to Apply\n• Notes about the Online Application\n• Supplemental Materials\n• Who Should Apply\n• When to Apply\n• TOEFL Requirements\n• Tips (Read Before You Begin Your Application)\n• More Information\n• The admission materials required by TGS.\n• Additional supporting materials may include your resume, research papers, certificates, etc.\n• Why it is that you would like to work in a particular specialization/topic and with a particular faculty as your adviser (for MS applicants this could be a project or thesis adviser)\n• Why it is that a particular faculty should be interested in having you as an advisee\n• Admissions FAQ\n• Engineering Home\n• ECE Department\n• Academics\n• Graduate Study\n• Admissions\n• The Graduate School\n• Graduate Funding\n• International Office\n• Graduate Housing\n• Meet Our Faculty\n• Our Whole-Brain Engineering Philosophy\n• CE Graduate Study Manual\n• EE Graduate Study Manual",
