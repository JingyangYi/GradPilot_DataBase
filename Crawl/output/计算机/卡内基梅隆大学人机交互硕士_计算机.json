Would I be eligible for the accelerated master's degree?Yes. The Accelerated Master of Human-Computer Interaction degree is for Carnegie Mellon undergraduate students who are completing the BS in HCI or the additional major in HCI.\nDoes the department provide career counseling or job placement?Carnegie Mellon has a centralized career services center called the Career and Professional Development Center (CPDC). The CPDC offers a variety of career service resources for our students, including career fairs, networking and conferences within Carnegie Mellon and the School of Computer Science. The HCII also hosts HCII-specific career events including recruitment sessions, portfolio reviews, and networking events throughout the year. Our students graduate with a coveted skill set and have excellent job placement records. View the recent MHCI first destination outcomes (pdf), or interact with the alumni data by year and program on the CMU First Destination Outcomes Dashboard.\nWhat kind of jobs can I get with an MHCI degree and who employs HCI graduates?Our graduates have successfully obtained careers as Usability Specialists, Interface Specialists, User Interface Designers, UX Researchers, Research Programmers, Product Designers, and Usability Engineers for companies such as Amazon, Apple, Bloomberg, Google, IBM, Microsoft, NASA, Sandia National Laboratories, and Wayfair, just to name a few.\nThe HCII is in the School of Computer Science. I do not have a strong programming background. May I still apply?Yes! We encourage you to apply without having a strong programming background. We welcome students from many disciplines outside of computer science (e.g., design, psychology, business, etc.) Prior to starting classes in the fall, non-technical students will complete a programming requirement either by taking an external course or by completing the department's online programming course. This ensures all students, despite different backgrounds, are prepared for the technical requirements of the degree.\nWill I have to take a lot of programming courses?Once you have met the programming requirement, you will be expected to take either Programming Usable Interfaces (PUI) or Software Structures for User Interfaces (SSUI) as part of your degree requirements. The former course is intended for non-technical students, while the latter course is intended for students with a strong technical background.\nMay I complete the Masters of Human-Computer Interaction program online?No, the CMU MHCI program is not available as an online degree.\nWhat are my chances of getting in? The 2024-25 application cycle had a 13% acceptance rate. This rate varies from year to year.\nMay I apply for admission starting in the spring instead of the fall?No, we only process admissions once a year. Applications are due in January for admission in the fall term of the same year.\nI just finished my undergraduate work. Should I apply for the Master of Human-Computer Interaction program first as preparation for my Ph.D. work? The MHCI program is not intended to serve as preparation for our Ph.D. program. The MHCI program is intended to teach the skills necessary for professional practice in various HCI related careers. The Ph.D. program, on the other hand, is designed to prepare you to be an HCI researcher. If you intend to apply to both programs, then you must submit two separate applications.\nIf I am not accepted for the HCII Ph.D. program will I automatically be considered for admission to the MHCI program instead?No. Because of the different educational goals of each program, their admissions processes are separate and applications are not shared between the two programs. As noted in the previous question, the two programs are designed to address different goals.\nMay I apply to the MHCI program and other HCII master's degrees? Yes, you may apply to any program, but students usually prefer one to the other. The programs have been designed to address different goals. Explore the different HCII master's degrees on our website.\nWill I be interviewed? Candidates may be considered for interviews as part of the admission process. Interviews would be scheduled via the email address you have listed on your application.\nShould I visit before I apply (and will that help my chances of being admitted)?Visiting the department before you apply does not improve one’s chances of admission. Students who have been admitted may be invited to visit during the Spring Open House, an event for accepted students to tour the campus, meet with faculty and current students, explore curriculum and be welcomed into the department.\nDo my chances of getting admitted increase if I submit my application early? No, all applications are reviewed as a group once the application deadline has passed. Submitting early does not increase your chances of admittance. Submitting early does ensure that your application is complete and on time for review.\nI have been out of school for some time. May I submit reference letters from my employers instead of from instructors? Yes, you may send us letters from your employers. Applicants should ask for recommendations from people who know them and their work very well.\nDo I have to submit GRE scores?GRE scores are optional.\nShould you want to provide GRE scores please note the following:\nScores should be sent directly to the HCII using Institution code, 2074; Department code, 0402. Please allow 10 business days after you have submitted your application and paid the fee to have your scores marked as received in the application.\nDo I have to take the GRE Subject test?No, applicants to the MHCI program are not required to take any GRE Subject tests.\nHow high do my GRE scores need to be? We review all materials in a student's application and consider each in assessing admission to the program. Due to our unique approach, we do not set a minimum GRE requirement for applicants.\nWhat are the GRE and TOEFL institution and department codes?GRE: Institution code, 2074; Department code, 0402TOEFL: Institution code, 4256; Department code, 78\nDo I have to take the TOEFL or IELTS?If you will be studying on an F-1 or J-1 visa, and English is not a native language for you (native language…meaning spoken at home and from birth), we are required to formally evaluate your English proficiency.\nWe require applicants who will be studying on an F-1 or J-1 visa, and for whom English is not a native language, to demonstrate English proficiency via one of these standardized tests: TOEFL (preferred), IELTS, or Duolingo.  We discourage the use of the \"TOEFL ITP Plus for China,\" since speaking is not scored.\nWe do not issue waivers for non-native speakers of English.

(Scores from exams taken before Sept. 1, 2022, will not be accepted.)\nWhat is the minimum TOEFL requirement? IELTS?For the iBT, minimum score required is 25 on each subsection (for a total minimum score of 100.) For the Paper Based Test (PBT), a minimum score of 600 is required. For the IELTS, minimum score of 8.5 with no subscore below 8 is required.\nDo I still need to submit a TOEFL/IELTS score if I have a degree from a U.S. educational institution?Yes, the TOEFL or IELTS is still required. Your application will NOT be considered complete without the TOEFL or IELTS test.\nMHCI continues to accept the Duolingo English Test (DET) for the Admission application. The English proficiency requirement cannot be waived for any reason.\nWe strongly encourage applicants to take either the TOEFL or IELTS. In cases where these are not available, it is acceptable to take the Duolingo test.\nDET Minimum Scores:\nWhat if I have taken the GMAT? The MHCI program does not accept the GMAT.\nIf I am accepted, can I defer my acceptance to the following year? No, students who are accepted into the MHCI program may not defer their acceptance.\nI applied last year. Can you reuse my application materials? No, you will be required to re-submit your application for this year's application cycle.\nI submitted my application. When will I hear back?Applicants will receive an admissions decision by March 15th of that application cycle.\nIs financial aid available?No, the HCII is not able to provide financial aid, but there are often fellowships and grants available to graduate students. It is up to the students to pursue these options.\nWhere can I find information on graduate student scholarships and financial aid? An excellent source for general information on financial aid can be found at FinAid. The Carnegie Mellon Fellowships and Scholarships Office is also available for assistance.

The MHCI curriculum is strategically designed to teach core user-centered research, interaction design, user experience and interface programming skills while allowing students to customize their own HCI path with unique electives from across the university.\nStudents enrolled in the MHCI program are required to take 7 core classes and 4 electives to complete their degree and graduate.\n1)  05-600: HCI Pro-Seminar: Communications in HCIThis course has three objectives to strengthen HCI communication skills for work in industry: to expose students to the world of HCI through research and industry expert talks; to give students the opportunity to sharpen their English writing skills; And to introduce students to conflict management, teamwork and active listening skills in order to give them tools to collaborate more efficiently on multi-disciplinary teams.\n2)  05-610: User-Centered Research and Evaluation (UCRE)This course provides an overview and introduction to the field of human-computer interaction. It introduces students to tools, techniques and sources of information about HCI and provides a systematic approach to design. The course increases awareness of good and bad design through observation of existing technology, and teaches the basic skills of task analysis, and analytic and empirical evaluation methods. Graduate students will also participate in a laboratory where they will practice HCI techniques in an independent, self-defined project.\n3)  05-660 Interaction Design FundamentalsThis studio course introduces students to design thinking and the basic practices of interaction design. It follows a human-centered design process that includes research, concept generation, prototyping, and refinement. Students must work effectively as individuals and in small teams to design mobile information systems and other interactive experiences. Assignments approach design on three levels: specific user interactions, contexts of use, and larger systems. Students will become familiar with design methodologies such as sketching, storyboarding, wire framing, prototyping, etc. No coding is required. This course serves as a prerequisite for Advanced Interaction Design (05-661).\n4)  05-661: Advanced Interaction DesignThis course follows 05-660: Interaction Design Fundamentals, and students are expected to apply what they have learned about design thinking and methodologies as a starting point for all assignments. Students will work in teams to perform guerrilla research, synthesize data, and consider the needs of multiple stakeholders in their design of mobile services and other intelligent systems. Design concepts go beyond user inter faces to include sensors, controls, and ubiquitous computing. Emphasis is placed on the quality of the students’ ideas and their ability to give form to their design concepts. By completing and presenting their work, students will gain skills related to professional UX design practice.\n5)  Choice: 05-630 or 05-63105-630: Programming Usable Interfaces (PUI) This course combines lectures and an intensive programming lab and design studio. It is for those who want to express their interactive ideas in working prototypes. It will cover the importance of human-computer interaction/interface design, iterative design, input/output techniques, how to design and evaluate interfaces, and research topics that will impact user interfaces in the future.\n05-631: Software Structures for User Interfaces (SSUI)SSUI covers the basic and detailed concepts and principles that go into building software to implement user interfaces. It considers factors of input, output, application interface, and related infrastructure as well as the typical patterns used to implement them, and how these aspects are organized and managed within a well-structured object oriented system.\n6)  05-671: HCI Project I (15-unit spring course) and\n7)  05-672: HCI Project II (48-unit summer course)Experiential learning is key component of the MHCI program. Through a substantial team project, students apply classroom knowledge in analysis and evaluation, implementation and design, and develop skills working in multidisciplinary teams. The project begins in the spring semester before graduation and continues full-time through the final summer semester; it must be taken in consecutive spring and summer semesters.\nTake a look at other MHCI students' favorite interdisciplinary electives or learn more about the available courses on the HCII course guide or the official CMU Schedule of Classes.\nProspective students can view MHCI sample study plans to reference example schedules. At this time, there are no online degrees or classes available for any programs in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute.\nSince its founding, our program has graduated more than 1,000 students. The in-depth interdisciplinary experiences here at Carnegie Mellon make our students the glue between design, development and management in many companies. The MHCI student is often hired to play one role, but quickly becomes an indispensable team player — in many cases, a team leader for research, design and strategy in software, technical or consulting engagements.\nFor more information about our policies and procedures, please view our MHCI Handbook available below.\nThe application for the next MHCI program (2025-26 cohort) is now closed.\nPlease check back in the fall when our next application season will begin.\nCapstone Project\nSample Study Plans\nTuition & Aid\nAlumni Board\nMHCI Alumni\nNicole Willis\nMHCI Director of Student Affairs\nHuman-Computer Interaction Institute\nCarnegie Mellon University\n300 S.
