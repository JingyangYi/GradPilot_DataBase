Make a gift.\nComputational Science and Engineering (CSE) is an interdisciplinary subject that uses mathematical concepts to solve complex science and engineering problems. Our CSE master’s program is led by faculty from Computer Science, Applied Math, and the Engineering Sciences. It provides students with rigorous training in the mathematical and computational foundations of Computational Science and Engineering.\nYou can learn more about the CSE program by watching the videos at the links below:\nCSE is an exciting and rapidly evolving field that exploits the power of computation as an approach to major challenges at the frontiers of natural and social science and all engineering fields. Sitting at the intersection of Computer Science and Applied Math, the master’s program offers students experience with mathematical techniques for modeling and simulation of complex systems; parallel programming and collaborative software development; and methods for organizing, exploring, visualizing, processing and analyzing very large data sets.\nStudents interested in the CSE program can choose to apply to either the Master of Science (SM) or Master of Engineering (ME) degree. Students take 8 courses to complete the SM degree. The degree can be completed in 2 semesters (one academic year), although many students choose to extend to a third semester to take additional courses and to allow themselves time to pursue a summer internship in industry. To earn the ME degree, students will spend four semesters (two academic years) on campus, spending a year on a master’s thesis research project after completing the same set of 8 courses required for the SM.\nComputational Science and Engineering is a field that uses computers and mathematics to model, simulate and visualize complex systems, in nature and society, and make sense of large data sets.

Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Make a gift.\nUpcoming Virtual CSE + Data Science Information Sessions\nProgram staff from our CSE and Data Science programs will present information about our terminal masters programs and application process, as well as take questions.\nImportant Note: This page was updated on December 10, 2024 and is subject to change. It does not supersede any information provided by the Harvard Kenneth C. Griffin Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.\nThe submission portal is now closed for applications to the Data Science and Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) programs for entry in Fall 2025. Out of fairness to all applicants, SEAS does not accept late applications for any programs. Information about the Fall 2026 application will be available in Summer 2025 from the Harvard Kenneth C. Griffin Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (Harvard Griffin GSAS) website. Candidates will apply via the application portal on that website, and the deadline for that application will be 5pm Eastern Time, December 1, 2025.\nSEAS offers admissions for Fall Term matriculation only. In addition to the information below, please read the Harvard Griffin GSAS Application Instruction and Information page  for important details pertaining to your graduate application.\nSEAS takes a holistic approach to admission, taking all relevant application materials into account. There is no GPA cutoff.  The Data Science and CSE programs are looking for candidates who have  demonstrated a capacity for advanced computational work  by one or more of the following:\nThere are no formal prerequisites  for applicants to these master’s programs. However, successful applicants do need to have sufficient background knowledge of calculus, linear algebra and differential equations; familiarity with probability and statistical inference; fluency in at least one programming language such as python or R, and an understanding of basic computer science concepts. As both Data Science and Computational Science and Engineering are interdisciplinary fields, SEAS welcomes applicants with undergraduate training in a wide range of academic disciplines. If your training in computer science, math and/or statistics is not reflected in the courses listed on your transcripts, you will need to find other parts of the application to make your training clear to the Admissions Committee. The Additional Materials section of the application is available to upload relevant information. You can also describe your training at one of your jobs or through self-study in your Statement of Purpose.\nSEAS does not accept General GRE scores nor Subject Test GRE scores for applicants to our programs. Applicants to these programs should  not   submit official or unofficial GRE scores to us nor mention them anywhere in their application materials.\nInternational Students:  Applicants from institutions outside of the US must hold the equivalent of a US bachelor’s degree (BA or BS) from an institution of recognized standing (either a three or four year undergraduate degree). Applicants must submit original certified documents indicating the nature and scope of the education program(s) they have pursued. Only students who have a BA or BS degree, first class honors, or other evidence of academic excellence and who can understand rapid, idiomatic English, and can speak, write, and read English with a high degree of fluency should apply for admission. Click here for more information regarding English proficiency requirements. Students who are unsure of the US equivalency of their degree(s) should consult a reputable credential evaluation service.\nImportant:  Candidates for master’s degrees are not eligible for financial aid from SEAS. Students typically finance their master’s degree program with a combination of loans, savings, family support, grants (from governments, foundations and companies), fellowships and scholarships. We recommend you visit the Harvard Griffin GSAS Funding and Financial Aid website prior to your application to learn more about your options.\nSelect Engineering and Applied Sciences, then your desired degree and area of study.\nContacting faculty is not recommended for master's program applicants.\nWhile this section is relevant for applicants to the SEAS PhD programs, it is not necessary for Master's applicants to complete this section of the application.\nThe Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL)  is required from all applicants whose native language is not English and who do not hold a Bachelor’s degree (or its equivalent) from an institution at which English is the language of instruction. Questions about this requirement, including waiver queries, should be directed to the contact information found on  the Harvard Griffin GSAS page on English Proficiency.\nApplicants to SEAS may opt to take the  The International English Language Testing System (IELTS)  instead of the TOEFL.\nNo test other than the iBT TOEFL or IELTS will be accepted as proof of English proficiency. The TOEFL iBT Home Edition is not accepted, nor is a Duolingo test. A master's degree is not accepted as proof of English proficiency.\nThis should include education, work experience if any, honors, awards, papers submitted for publication, and other achievements.\nThis is your chance to tell the Admissions Committee about your experiences (including additional training not indicated on your transcript), interests, future goals, etc. Please keep the statement to about 1,000 words.\nWaivers are available; eligibility is determined by completing a series of questions in the Application Fee section of the application. Once these questions have been completed, the application system will provide an immediate response regarding fee waiver eligibility.\nMiscellaneous Materials: Please do not send any materials other than what is required to complete the application. This includes copies of awards, papers for publication, multimedia, etc.; the requested resume or CV is the appropriate place to indicate these achievements. Miscellaneous materials other than those mentioned in the instructions above will not be reviewed by the committee. It is best not to send them.\nInterviews: We do not require an interview as part of the application process and we cannot offer applicants the opportunity for an in-person interview with the admissions staff.\nAll applications will be under review beginning in December. Applicants will be notified of an official admissions decision by Harvard Griffin GSAS at the end of the review period (mid-February). Admissions decisions will be posted to the applicant’s online account in Slate. For privacy and security purposes, neither Harvard Griffin GSAS nor SEAS give out admissions decisions over the phone or via email. Refer to the Harvard Griffin GSAS After Application Submission page for additional information.\nThe application cannot be edited or changed once it has been submitted  . Should a letter of recommendation arrive after the application deadline it will be added to your application file. However, application review will begin shortly after the deadline, so the later the letter arrives, the more chance there is that your file will be reviewed without the letter.  We cannot guarantee that materials received after the application deadline will be included in the application review.\nThere is one exception: applicants will be able to access the  Fall 2024 Grade Report  page of the application after submission. Should you wish to update your grades for courses taken in the Fall 2024 term, you can do so there. No other changes can be made to your application; this includes the addition of materials such as an updated resume or Statement of Purpose.  SEAS is not able to respond to inquiries asking us to make changes or add materials to a submitted application.\nAs the application is administered by Harvard Griffin GSAS, SEAS cannot respond to individual inquiries asking about the receipt of material or status of your application. The best and fastest way to check the status of your application (including receipt of letters of recommendation and official language test scores) is to log into the applicant portal:\nHarvard Griffin GSAS handles the online application for SEAS graduate programs. If you experience technical issues with the application, please email gsas_apphelp@fas.harvard.edu . Again, this email is for technical issues only. All other inquiries should be directed to admiss@fas.harvard.edu.\nQuestions regarding the application, English proficiency, and/or finances should be directed to the Harvard Griffin GSAS Office of Admissions:   admiss@fas.harvard.edu \nAdmissions Questions: 617.496.6100 | Financial Aid Questions: 617.495.5396\nQuestions specific to the degree program in Data Science or Computational Science and Engineering should be directed mastersadmissions@seas.harvard.edu.\nWhat prerequisites are necessary for applicants to the Data Science and CSE master's programs?\nThere are no formal prerequisites  for applicants to these programs. However, successful applicants do need to have sufficient background knowledge of calculus, linear algebra and differential equations; familiarity with probability and statistical inference; fluency in at least one programming language such as python or R, and an understanding of basic computer science concepts.\nAm I eligible to apply to this program if my undergraduate degree is in economics, business, or some other non-STEM field?\nAs interdisciplinary fields, both Data Science and CSE attract students with varied backgrounds. SEAS welcomes master’s applicants with undergraduate training in a wide range of academic disciplines.\nIf my undergraduate degree is not in a STEM field, how can I show that I have a sufficient technical background?\nIf your training in computer science, math and/or statistics is not reflected in the courses listed on your transcripts, you will need to find other parts of the application to make your training clear to the Admissions Committee. The Additional Materials section of the application is available to upload relevant information. You can also describe your training at one of your jobs or through self-study in your Statement of Purpose.\nCan I pursue the Data Science or CSE master's degree part-time while I am working?\nThe SEAS master's degree programs are full-time on-campus programs. All students are required to be registered full-time (i.e. take four 4-credit courses each semester). All of the courses students will take while in the program are offered during the day and require students to be present on campus.\nCan I extend the length of my program in order to pursue additional coursework?\nBarring extraordinary circumstances, students must complete their master's degree program within four semesters.\nWhen and how can I apply? Does the program have rolling admissions?\nThe SEAS master's programs use the online application for the Harvard Kenneth C. Griffin Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.\nWe do not have rolling admissions. There is a single application deadline each year - December 1st.\nCan I apply to both the Data Science and CSE master's programs?\nNo, applicants should not apply to both the Data Science and CSE programs. Applicants should select the program that best fits their preparation and interests and apply to that particular program.\nIf I am admitted, can I request a deferral?\nSEAS does not grant deferrals for our terminal masters programs except in cases with extenuating circumstances. We do not grant deferrals for our masters programs for reasons related to employment or financing the cost of the program. You are encouraged to submit an application only for the year in which you intend to start your graduate studies.\nHow can I find the Data Science and CSE master's programs in the Harvard Griffin GSAS application system?\nYou will find both programs in the Harvard Griffin GSAS online application under the listings for Engineering and Applied Sciences. On the Degree Program Selection page choose \"Engineering and Applied Sciences\" as the program, \"Data Science\" or “Computational Science and Engineering” as the Area of Study, and \"SM\" or “ME” as the degree.\nIs the GRE required?\nQuestions about the SEAS GRE policy and requirements should be directed to the SEAS Office of Graduate Admissions.\nDo all of my recommendation letters have to be from academic sources?\nYou should get letters of recommendation from the three people you think will be able to make the best case for why you are an outstanding applicant for this degree program. These should be people who know you and your capabilities very well. Former professors can certainly be valuable sources of recommendation letters, but letters from managers or colleagues from your work experience can also be helpful.\nShould I send copies of articles, papers, or any other supporting materials for consideration along with my application?\nPlease do not send any materials other than what is required to complete the application. This includes copies of awards, papers for publication, multimedia, etc.; the requested resume or CV is the appropriate place to indicate these achievements. Miscellaneous materials other than those mentioned in the instructions above will not be reviewed by the committee. It is best not to send them.\nAre the Data Science and CSE programs STEM designated?\nWhat are the English proficiency requirements?\nMy undergraduate degree is/will be from an institution outside the US. May I apply?\nApplicants from institutions outside of the US must hold the equivalent of a US bachelor’s degree (BA or BS) from an institution of recognized standing (either a three or four year undergraduate degree). Applicants must submit original certified documents indicating the nature and scope of the education program(s) they have pursued. Only students who have an AB or SB degree, first class honors, or other evidence of academic excellence and who can understand rapid, idiomatic English, and can speak, write, and read English with a high degree of fluency should apply for admission.\nWhere should I direct questions about visas and travel?\nPlease contact the Harvard International Office (HIO).\nWhere can I learn about tuition for these programs?\nTuition information for the Data Science and CSE programs is located on the Harvard Griffin GSAS Cost of Attendance page.\nIs there financial aid available?\nCurrently, Harvard is not providing financial aid for SEAS master's programs. Students typically finance their master’s degree program with a combination of loans, savings, family support, grants (from governments, foundations and companies), and outside fellowships or scholarships. We recommend you visit the Harvard Griffin GSAS Funding and Financial Aid website prior to your application to learn more about your options.\n• Application Instructions (key fields)\n• Admissions Timeline\n• Contact Information\n• Admissions FAQs\n• excelling in courses in math, computer science, statistics or scientific computing;\n• exploring computational or statistical approaches in undergraduate research;\n• through distinctive professional or personal accomplishment.\n• Transcripts must be uploaded electronically.

Griffin Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (Harvard Griffin GSAS) website. Candidates will apply via the application portal on that website, and the deadline for that application will be 5pm Eastern Time, December 1, 2025.\nSEAS offers admissions for Fall Term matriculation only. In addition to the information below, please read the Harvard Griffin GSAS Application Instruction and Information page  for important details pertaining to your graduate application. \nAdmissions Criteria\nSEAS takes a holistic approach to admission, taking all relevant application materials into account. There is no GPA cutoff.  The Data Science and CSE programs are looking for candidates who have  demonstrated a capacity for advanced computational work  by one or more of the following:\n\nexcelling in courses in math, computer science, statistics or scientific computing;\nexploring computational or statistical approaches in undergraduate research;\nthrough distinctive professional or personal accomplishment.\n\nThere are no formal prerequisites  for applicants to these master’s programs. However, successful applicants do need to have sufficient background knowledge of calculus, linear algebra and differential equations; familiarity with probability and statistical inference; fluency in at least one programming language such as python or R, and an understanding of basic computer science concepts. As both Data Science and Computational Science and Engineering are interdisciplinary fields, SEAS welcomes applicants with undergraduate training in a wide range of academic disciplines. If your training in computer science, math and/or statistics is not reflected in the courses listed on your transcripts, you will need to find other parts of the application to make your training clear to the Admissions Committee. The Additional Materials section of the application is available to upload relevant information. You can also describe your training at one of your jobs or through self-study in your Statement of Purpose.\nSEAS does not accept General GRE scores nor Subject Test GRE scores for applicants to our programs. Applicants to these programs should  not   submit official or unofficial GRE scores to us nor mention them anywhere in their application materials.  \nInternational Students:  Applicants from institutions outside of the US must hold the equivalent of a US bachelor’s degree (BA or BS) from an institution of recognized standing (either a three or four year undergraduate degree). Applicants must submit original certified documents indicating the nature and scope of the education program(s) they have pursued. Only students who have a BA or BS degree, first class honors, or other evidence of academic excellence and who can understand rapid, idiomatic English, and can speak, write, and read English with a high degree of fluency should apply for admission. Click here for more information regarding English proficiency requirements. Students who are unsure of the US equivalency of their degree(s) should consult a reputable credential evaluation service.  \nImportant:  Candidates for master’s degrees are not eligible for financial aid from SEAS. Students typically finance their master’s degree program with a combination of loans, savings, family support, grants (from governments, foundations and companies), fellowships and scholarships. We recommend you visit the Harvard Griffin GSAS Funding and Financial Aid website prior to your application to learn more about your options. \nApplication Instructions (key fields)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Degree Program Selection\n        \n\n\n\nSelect Engineering and Applied Sciences, then your desired degree and area of study.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Institutions Attended\n        \n\n\n\n\nTranscripts must be uploaded electronically.

There is a single application deadline each year - December 1st.\nCan I apply to both the Data Science and CSE master's programs?\nNo, applicants should not apply to both the Data Science and CSE programs. Applicants should select the program that best fits their preparation and interests and apply to that particular program.\nIf I am admitted, can I request a deferral?\nSEAS does not grant deferrals for our terminal masters programs except in cases with extenuating circumstances. We do not grant deferrals for our masters programs for reasons related to employment or financing the cost of the program. You are encouraged to submit an application only for the year in which you intend to start your graduate studies.\nHow can I find the Data Science and CSE master's programs in the Harvard Griffin GSAS application system?\nYou will find both programs in the Harvard Griffin GSAS online application under the listings for Engineering and Applied Sciences. On the Degree Program Selection page choose \"Engineering and Applied Sciences\" as the program, \"Data Science\" or “Computational Science and Engineering” as the Area of Study, and \"SM\" or “ME” as the degree.\nIs the GRE required?\nSEAS does not accept General GRE scores nor Subject Test GRE scores for applicants to our programs.
