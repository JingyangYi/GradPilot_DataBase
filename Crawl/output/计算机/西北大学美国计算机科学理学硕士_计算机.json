If there are issues that are not addressed here, please contact the CS Office of Student Affairs.\nJump to a Section\nWe do not set minimums beyond those required by the Graduate School, but with more than 1700 applications every year and a limit of about 250 offers, competition is stiff. The average GPA for those made offers is 3.82, and the median TOEFL (when required) was 108.\nAll applicants who received offers had degrees or at least a minor in CS or a closely related area.\nReturn to Top\nApplicants pursuing a doctoral degree should select the PhD option. Students pursuing a PhD may also obtain a master's degree during their doctoral career at Northwestern University. You should select the MS option ONLY if you are seeking a terminal master's degree. Note that no financial aid is offered to those seeking the terminal MS degree.\nReturn to Top\nThere is no separate financial aid application. Financial aid, including tuition and stipend, is offered to all admitted doctoral students; however, no financial aid is offered to terminal master's students. There are several sources of loans available, and as a graduate student, you will be eligible for Federal Direct Student Loans. The Evanston Office of Graduate Financial Aid will be able to counsel you about your eligibility. You can email them here.\nPlease feel free to follow up with the The Evanston Office of Graduate Financial Aid if you have questions about financing your MS degree. Visit the The Evanston Office of Graduate Financial Aid website for more information about tuition, fees, billing and payment information. Student loan info can be found here. Northwestern loan procedures, deadlines, and downloadable forms are available here. Private outside scholarship assistance may be found here.\nIf your ultimate goal is to pursue a PhD, please keep in mind that you may enter PhD programs without having completed an MS degree. If financial aid is not required, please include a separate letter with your application materials stating that you do not need aid and briefly describing the source of your support.\nReturn to Top\nMaster’s applicants: Application fee waivers are not available.\nPhD applicants: Fee waiver information is provided on The Graduate School webpage.\nAdditionally, there are limited Computer Science PhD program fee waivers. To be considered, please upload an Academic Statement to your pending application and email the faculty member with whom you are specifically interested in conducting research. The Academic Statement can be uploaded before the application is submitted and prior to submitting an application fee. You can view the list of Computer Science faculty members here.\nReturn to top\nYou must either:\nDetailed information is provided by The Graduate School (TGS) at the following link: https://www.tgs.northwestern.edu/admission/application-procedures/application-requirements/test-scores.html.\nAdditionally, international students admitted to the PhD program are not eligible for funding as Teaching Assistants until they have met The Graduate School (TGS) English Proficiency Requirement described here: (https://www.elp.northwestern.edu/english-proficiency-testing/index.html). Note that TGS provides extensive help and support for international students (https://www.tgs.northwestern.edu/admission/before-you-apply/international-applicants.html) including many ways to further improve English proficiency https://www.elp.northwestern.edu/index.html)\nReturn to Top\nThe institution code for Northwestern University is 1565 for both exams. Though a GRE score is not required, if you wish to submit one, you can use 0000 if asked for the department code. For TOEFL, the department code for The Graduate School is 01.\nReturn to Top\nWhile a CS degree is not required, we receive over 1300 applications a year, mostly from those with CS or CS-related degrees. To be competitive, you need the equivalent of at least a minor in computer science.

The senior thesis is more than a big project write-up. It is documentation of an attempt to contribute new knowledge to the general understanding of some problem of computer science, together with exposition that sets the work in the context of what has come before and what might follow. In computer science, some theses involve building systems, some involve experiments and measurements, some are theoretical, some involve human subjects, some are in-depth literature reviews, some do more than one of these things, and so on.\nIf you are planning to complete a senior thesis, please fill out the Computer Science Undergraduate Thesis Registration form no later than Fall of senior year. This allows us to keep you updated on the senior thesis timelines, notify you of relevant events, send you instructions on submitting your thesis, and so on.\nThe undergraduate thesis will unify, for both McCormick and Weinberg students, what it means for students to achieve departmental honors in computer science. To be awarded honors, students must meet McCormick or Weinberg’s respective GPA and other requirements, and have submitted a thesis that is accepted by their thesis readers. While we expect many students who complete senior theses to be awarded honors, achieving honors is not a requirement for writing a senior thesis.\nSenior thesis projects generally emerge from collaboration with faculty. Normally this is a Computer Science faculty member (either core or courtesy). Exceptions to the requirement that the thesis supervisor is a CS faculty member must be approved by the CS Undergraduate Research Committee. For students whose advisor is not a CS faculty member, note that at least one of your thesis readers must be a CS faculty member, and we encourage you to talk with this faculty member regularly to help ensure that your thesis is appropriately relevant for Computer Science. It’s up to you and your supervisor how frequently you meet and how engaged the supervisor is in your thesis research. However, we encourage you to meet with your supervisor at least several times during the Fall, Winter, and Spring, and to agree on deadlines for initial results, chapter outlines, drafts, etc.\nStudents working towards a senior thesis may enroll in a senior thesis section of CS 399 in their junior or senior year, under the supervision of their research advisor. CS 399 provides students with time in their curriculum for independent research and thesis writing. Up to four quarters of enrollment in CS 399 (for senior thesis or otherwise) can be used towards meeting the technical elective; students can enroll in 399 for additional quarters for course credit as needed.\nThesis readers must be either: (A) two Northwestern CS faculty members (core or courtesy); or (B) three readers, at least one of whom is a Northwestern CS faculty member and the others are ordinarily faculty members of Weinberg or McCormick who are generally familiar with the research area. The thesis supervisor is one of the readers. The student is responsible for finding the other reader(s), but you can talk with your supervisor for suggestions of possible readers. Exceptions to these thesis reader requirements must be approved by the CS Undergraduate Research Committee.\nThe thesis should contain an informative abstract separate from the body of the thesis. This abstract should clearly state what the contribution of the thesis is–which parts are expository, whether there are novel results, etc. We also recommend the thesis contain an introduction that contains an “Our contributions” section which explains exactly what the thesis contributed, and which sections in the thesis these are elaborated on.\nAcceptance decisions are recorded by a staff member and passed on to the Committee on Undergraduate Studies in Computer Science for determinations of honors (i.e., checking that the student meets the GPA requirement beyond having an accepted thesis; note again that students can still complete a senior thesis, regardless of honors).\nWhile individual circumstances will vary, we generally expect students to begin work towards their thesis by the middle of their junior year, and for this work to continue well into senior year. Students should work with their faculty thesis advisor to identify potential readers early (e.g., during the Fall of senior year); this avoids a last-minute rush to find readers, and can help to provide other points of support and feedback during the thesis writing process.\nThe final version of the thesis must be turned in by April 15th for committee review. The thesis readers will have about a month and a half to complete their read (complete before Memorial Day), and for the committee on undergraduate studies to confer honors.\nWe will organize a senior thesis presentation and reception late in Spring quarter to celebrate the seniors who wrote senior theses. We encourage all senior thesis writers to present so we can properly celebrate your work! We will also select one or more undergraduate senior theses for an award.\nAccepted theses will be published as technical reports on the CS website.

It is also available to Computer Science students in Weinberg, resulting in a BA degree from Weinberg and an MS from McCormick.\nWith careful planning, students may commence work on their master’s degree before completing their bachelor’s degree. For some students, it may be possible to earn both degrees at the same time, in just four years.\nJump to a Section\nThe benefits of a BS/MS or BA/MS are many, including better job prospects and efficient use of your college experience. Studies show that newly employed computer science graduates holding a master's degree have the potential to make almost 50 percent more money than engineering candidates with only a bachelor's degree and no experience.\nJob candidates with a master's degree generally stand out in a field of applicants more so than similar candidates with a BS and no experience. For students whose bachelor's degree is not electrical engineering or computer engineering, the master's degree can provide entry into these lucrative fields.\nIn the shorter term, a BS/MS or BA/MS degree is an efficient use of your college time. Individuals who wait for completion of the BS or BA to enter a MS program usually take two years to complete the MS. Most candidates will complete the BS/MS or BA/MS in fewer than five years. The time it takes to complete the program is partially based on the amount of AP credit you brought to Northwestern and partially based on a carefully constructed curriculum that balances your course load and course requirements to ensure that you will complete the requirements for both programs in a timely fashion.\nReturn to Top\nAny Northwestern undergraduate enrolled in the Weinberg College or the McCormick School of Engineering is eligible to apply. Students in the undergraduate computer science and electrical and computer engineering programs are especially encouraged to consider the programs, as are McCormick and Weinberg students more generally. You do not need to be an electrical engineering, computer engineering, or computer science major to be admitted. Detailed information is available on the McCormick Combined Degree webpage.\nThe prerequisite courses are listed below.\nReturn to Top\nSometime in the later part of your sophomore year or early in your junior year you should talk to McCormick Graduate Programs about your intentions. Sometime during your junior year you should formally apply (see below).\nReturn to Top\nFor details on application requirements, deadlines, and the process, please refer to the information provided on the McCormick Combined Degree webpage.\nReturn to Top\nThe general requirements are that you satisfactorily complete 12 courses. Three of the courses must be 400-level courses. Beyond the general requirements, however, there are three options available for the MS program: coursework, project, or thesis.\nFor information on the requirements for the three options, see the CS MS Graduate Manual on the CS Graduate Forms and Documents page.\nReturn to Top\nYes, but you may not use those same courses to fulfill requirements for both your BS/BA and MS. In other words, a course can only fulfill requirements for one degree (the BS/BA or the MS) not both.\nReturn to Top\nThis depends on your interests and your career or research goals.\nIf you are already in the ECE or CE undergraduate program, the choice of an MS EE or CE will let you acquire considerably more depth (and thus market value) in these areas.  On the other hand, the choice of an MS in CS will broaden the range of positions for which you are suited.\nIf you are already in the CS undergraduate program in McCormick or in the CS undergraduate program in Weinberg, similar reasoning also applies: An MS in CS will give you added value by giving you considerably more depth in your specialty, while an MS in EE or CE will give you added value by broadening your expertise.\nIf you are in another undergraduate program at Northwestern, either master's degree will considerably broaden your expertise and thus marketability.\nGenerally speaking, the MS in EE or CE has a greater focus on hardware, while the MS in CS has a greater focus on software.\nIf you are unsure where your specific interests fall, the director of graduate studies will be happy to discuss options based on your specific goals.\nReturn to Top\nThe time it will take you to complete the program is dependent upon how well you have managed your undergraduate degree and careful planning in structuring your master's plan. Students who enter the University with several AP credits can, with planning, complete the degree in four years. Students who switched majors and had little or no AP credit will probably take five years.\nReturn to Top\nThe quarterly tuition for the BS/MS or BA/MS is the same as the tuition for a BS or BA. The bottom line is that if you plan well and complete both degrees in five years you will pay for an extra year of college, but you will have two degrees (two diplomas). If you entered Northwestern with AP credit it is possible to complete both programs in four years, but you should talk to your graduate adviser to make sure you have a plan that completes all of the requirements for both degrees.\nReturn to Top\nUndergraduates are eligible to receive NU scholarship assistance up to the equivalent of 12 quarters of enrollment. It may be possible that some of the courses for the master’s degree could be taken before you complete your undergraduate degree. You should contact the McCormick registrar or your adviser to see when your undergraduate degree will be awarded and if you have room to take some graduate-level courses. You may also want to contact McCormick Graduate Programs about the BS/MS program. There is no scholarship assistance for the MS portion of the program. As a graduate student, however, you will be eligible for Federal Direct Student Loans. The Student Financial Services Office (student-financial-services@northwestern.edu) will be able to counsel you about your eligibility.    If you have questions regarding your undergraduate financial aid please contact the Office of Undergraduate Financial Aid at undergradaid@u.northwestern.edu. Ken Brown in the Office of Student Financial Services works with McCormick graduate students.\nReturn to Top\nThis is your choice, and it will not affect your BS or BA degree. Once you complete the BS/BA requirements, you will be awarded the BS/BA. You should know, however, that The Graduate School allows you five years to complete the MS. If you simply want to complete the program as a part-time student or if you want to take time off, you should discuss your options with your graduate adviser and file the appropriate paperwork so that you will be able to complete the program at a later point in time. More generally, realize that The Graduate School's five-year window gives you plenty of time to consider your options.\nReturn to Top\nVisit the the McCormick School of Engineering website for more information.\n\"Computer science is underrated for the opportunity it gives to be creative, and you can iterate more quickly than almost any other discipline.

They were all eager to teach me everything and really embraced me as part of the team. It was amazing how quickly they brought me up to speed and taught me how everything worked. It felt like I was truly a member of the team.”\n“\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIt [co-op] exposed me to two different sides of my major and narrowed down what I want to do in my future career. I was able to experience both the research side of my major, biomedical engineering, and also the research and development for medical devices. I got to see two different doors. Essentially, that helped me narrow down what I want to do in the future.”\n“\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI built a lot of connections in the industry. It’s a lot easier to do that once you’re inside than from the outside. Having almost a year of experience comes in handy. You really build more meaningful connections in a co-op experience because they are really invested in watching you grow.”\n“\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBeing in a data analyst co-op helped me see what the role actually means and how to be responsible. I think that part is really important. Also, I connected with very amazing coworkers and supervisors.”\n“\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCo-ops presented a really interesting option as I started to look at internships, because you stay at a company longer. The projects you work on are bigger in scope and can last for months, rather than just 10 weeks.”\n“\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tParticipating in co-ops has helped me understand the meaning of my courses a lot better. It helped me see why what I was learning in school was important.”\nWe augment the analytical core of engineering with design, entrepreneurship, leadership, personal development, and unusual collaborations to imagine what's next and take the world in a whole new direction.Learn More\n• TueSep 23Grad Career Lab: Resume Strategies\n• WedSep 24Grad Career Lab: Resume Strategies\n• FriSep 26Northwestern 2025 Tech Career Fair\n• TueSep 30Grad Career Lab: Career Fair + Networking\n[CARD]\nCooperative Engineering Education Program (Co-op)Co-op is an educational program which allows engineering students to alternate periods of academic study with full-time periods of paid work experience related to their academic and professional goals.Explore Co-ops\n[CARD]\nInternshipsInternships offered by the Office of Career Development offer students opportunities to gain practical work experience with employers in industry, commerce, or government.Explore Internships\n[CARD]\nResearch ExperienceStudents who are interested in career paths in research and academia have the opportunity to engage in a formal engineering research experience, either at a university (including Northwestern University) or a government laboratory.Explore Research\n[CARD]\nService LearningThe Projects in Service Learning program offers students have the opportunity to volunteer their time and engineering skills for non-profit organizations.Explore Service Learning\n[CARD]\nConnect with McCormick career advisors, events, and resources\nUse McCormickConnect to view and sign up for ECD events and interviews, schedule appointments with your ECD career advisor, view job listings, and report co-op or internship positions for work-integrated learning.Explore McCormickConnect\n[CARD]\nLook for work and register for Northwestern career events\nHandshake is the central career services platform managed by Northwestern Career Advancement.

Thus, the admission process is highly selective and competitive. Details on the process are outlined in the sections below and in the Graduate Application FAQ.\nAdmissions FAQStart Your Application\nJump to a Section\nApplications for the 2025-2026 academic year become available on September 10 on the application website.\nThe deadline for PhD applicants is Sunday, December 1, 2024 (for Fall 2025). You can still apply after this deadline, up to December 15, 2024. However, be aware that applications are usually reviewed soon after the deadline, so late applications may not be processed as quickly. Most of the decisions are typically finalized by the end of March, but some decisions may be made as late as April 15.\nThe PhD Application Feedback Program aims to assist first-generation and underrepresented students with their applications to Computer Science PhD programs in the US. An advanced PhD student, postdoctoral fellow, or CS faculty volunteer will provide one round of feedback on an applicant's resume and statement of purpose (capacity limited). Volunteers may also arrange for a short 15 to 30-minute Zoom meeting to offer additional advice. Participation in the PhD Application Feedback Program does not guarantee admission to any program.\nTo participate in this year's PhD Application Feedback Program, please submit your application materials by November 4, 11:59 p.m. CST. Apply now\nApplications are accepted for Fall quarter only.\nThe deadline for application submission is July 21, 2025.\nReturn to Top\nThere are no paper application forms for either admission or financial aid.\nTo apply for admission to the CS department, go to The Graduate School (TGS) website, follow the link to \"Admission,” and then finally \"Apply Online\"\nReturn to Top\nTGS's online application form will ask you to select either the PhD or MS option for computer science. If you want a PhD, with or without a master's degree, select the PhD option. The MS option is for terminal master's only and does not constitute admission to further work toward a PhD.\nIt will also ask you to enter research area(s) among the research interest groups.\nIf you are applying for the PhD program, you will receive an email message asking you to provide additional information about your GPA and specific research interests. You will be asked to select your two or three top choices among the six research interest groups, based on your specific research interests. You may give more detail in your Statement of Purpose. For example, a student who would like to pursue research in \"wireless networks\" might select the Systems and Networking group.\nDisregard any blank sections you may see in the HTML view of your application after submission. Those were not required for the degree program you were applying to.\nIf you have submitted the required application materials, do not worry about the “Materials needed” flag. This is on be default and only turned off after we manually review the application and its attachments and determine if the English Language requirement has been met or waived. This may take a week or more during the busiest times. You will be contacted if any critical materials are missing.\nReturn to Top\nBefore you apply online, gather the following:\nPlease note that it is not required to send a hardcopy of your official transcripts. Instead, upload a scanned copy of it/them as PDFs, along with all the other supplementary materials, into your online application.\nNote that upon admission you may be required to provide the original transcript(s). An applicant may not be admitted without a complete application. All primary and supplemental materials must be submitted to render a decision to admit. Denies may be made due to incomplete applications.\nReturn to Top\nA typical applicant is expected to have a bachelor of science in electrical engineering, computer engineering, computer science, or a related discipline from a recognized institution. Prospective MS students with a minor in CS and a major in other areas (such as math, economics, etc.) are encouraged to apply. Highly qualified candidates with other academic backgrounds may also be considered.\nThe specific undergraduate preparation required for graduate study depends on the program and the area of specialization. An applicant who has insufficient undergraduate preparation in any particular area but is well-qualified in every other respect may be required to take certain undergraduate courses as soon as possible after enrolling at Northwestern. That student would be informed of such a requirement at the time of admission.​\nReturn to Top\nA current Northwestern University CS MS student can request a transfer from the MS program to the PhD program. Such a transfer request is only seriously considered if there is a CS faculty member who advocates the transfer and commits to financially supporting the student. That faculty member will help the student formally apply for the transfer, which will then be considered by the department. Students may formally apply for a transfer without a faculty advocate, but the chance of approval in this case is very low.\nReturn to Top\nMS and PhD applicants should apply to begin only in the fall quarter. Note that we only allow for fall admits to both programs. Winter and spring quarter admission requests by MS and PhD applicants will be automatically denied, in general.\nThe only mechanism for winter or spring quarter PhD admission involves the intervention of one of our faculty, who must agree to support the student in question as a research assistant for the remainder of the academic year. To explore this possibility, an applicant should contact individual professors listed in th department's faculty directory.\nYou can view a great deal of general information about requirements and policies on The Graduate School website. For more info, please contact the CS department graduate office.\nReturn to Top\nFor both MS and PhD students, we require:\nLearn more about English language requirements\nReturn to Top\nWe understand that proceeding with the application process for graduate studies is not an easy decision or something that should be considered lightly. To help you in making up your mind and give you some hints regarding the overall evaluation criteria, we provide a discussion of some of the relevant issues below.\nWe do receive applications with transcripts using different GPA scales (10.0, 100%, etc.) and we apply the adjusted criteria to such scales. Hence, applicants do not need to provide any conversions and should leave their GPAs in their institutions' standard scale. As another specific example, many of the universities from India have a \"class-based\" evaluation scheme, and we note that we will always give priority to \"First Class with Distinction\" applicants. The application process does allow you to write the \"self-reported\" GPA on the scale of 4.0; however, we will always use the transcripts during evaluation process.\nMaster's applicants: GRE scores are neither required nor considered in applications.\nPhD applicants: GRE scores are not required, but will be considered in applications if you wish to submit them.\nPlease keep in mind however that you will still need to meet the minimum requirements for English proficiency as stated above.\nPrimarily for PhD applicants, CS faculty interested in advising may conduct separate interviews for further informal assessment of applicants.\nRefer to requirements at Graduate School\nSee The Graduate School description of what is expected for the required Academic Statement and Personal Statement.\nFor PhD applicants, the Academic Statement carries extremely important weight, so the statement should be written in a clear and focused manner. Namely, upon reading it, an evaluator/faculty should get a crisp idea as to:\nStatements should provide a good balance between background, vision, and desiderata.\nExample: simply saying that you like Northwestern or you have a high esteem for the faculty in CS is not recommended.\nLastly, while this may not always be possible, it will be helpful if at least some parts of the recommendation letters can back up the claims made in the statement of purpose.\nIn the online application system, each applicant will be given the option to choose in order of preference among different Programs of Study in our department. Faculty examine applications in their respective areas; therefore, every applicant, especially for the PhD program, should carefully examine every faculty members research interests on our website. Furthermore, applicants will be asked to provide up to two names of specific faculty members whom they would like to study under. This is highly recommended and useful for identifying candidates to consider.\nA minimum of two letters is required, but three is highly recommended.\nWe will value all your achievements (e.g. awards received in competitions) and experiences (e.g. research projects, leadership). However, the best place to put them in a coherent manner is your resume. Ideally, some of these items should also be properly linked with the statement of purpose document.\nReturn to Top\nPlease consult our Graduate Admissions FAQ if you have more questions, or continue on to Financial Aid, Assistantships, & Fellowships.\nNorthwestern University does not make decisions related to admissions, including but not limited to financial aid and scholarships, based upon any category protected by the law. The University is committed to complying with all applicable laws. The University believes different perspectives, experiences, and backgrounds are critical to building a dynamic student body, and as such encourages all qualified applicants to apply.\nMS Admission Questions\n• Application Deadlines and Important Dates\n• How to Apply\n• Notes About the Online Application\n• Supplemental Materials\n• Who Should Apply\n• Who Should Not Apply\n• When to Apply\n• English-language Requirements\n• Tips (Important Info to Read Before You Begin Your Application)\n• More Information\n• The admission materials required by TGS.\n• Additional supporting materials include your resume and may include research papers, certificates, etc.\n• GREs will NOT be required for the 2024-2025 CS doctoral or masters program applications.\n• Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) score of 90 or better (IBT), or\n• International English Language Testing System (IELTS) score of 7.0 or better, or\n• Michigan English Test (MET) score of 54 for master's applicants or better and score of 61 or better for PhD applicants, or\n• An undergraduate degree or graduate degree from an accredited institution where the language of instruction is English.\n• Why is it that you would like to work in a particular major/specialization/topic and with a particular faculty as your adviser (for MS applicants this could be a project or thesis adviser)?\n• Why is it that a particular faculty should be interested in having you as an advisee?\n• Admissions FAQ\n• Engineering Home\n• CS Department\n• Academics\n• Graduate\n• Admissions\n• The Graduate School\n• Graduate Funding\n• International Office\n• Graduate Housing\n• Meet Our Faculty\n• Our Whole-Brain Engineering Philosophy",

Students will complete two courses: COMP_SCI 298: CS Research Track Program (fall) and COMP_SCI 398: Research Track Practicum (winter) and present their findings during a spring research showcase event.\nThe department maintains a list of research opportunities currently available to undergraduates. This list contains information about requirements for joining the lab and/or leading a project, as well as information on how to apply to join the lab. the list is updated periodically as research opportunities become available.\nTo learn more about the major research activities in the Department of Computer Science, you can also explore our various Research Areas:\nFor more information about research opportunities in the department, visit our groups and labs page and contact a professor with whom you would like to work.\nLearn more about undergraduate research opportunities at McCormick\nBefore joining a research lab you will need to build the background that is necessary for participating in the research of the lab. The most effective way to do so is through courses, which requires planning ahead what courses to take and when. The earliest you complete the series of courses that will give you a solid background for an area of research, the fastest you will be able to get involved in a research project and benefit from the research activity in the department.\nTo help you prepare for research, the department maintains a collection of accelerated course pathways. Each pathway targets a specific area of research and consists of one or two courses per quarter. Starting on a pathway during your freshman year will get your ready for a research project in the pathway's area during your sophomore year.\nUndergraduate students have the option to complete a senior thesis as a part of their undergraduate degree. The senior thesis is documentation of an attempt to contribute new knowledge to the general understanding of some problem of computer science.\nResearch Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) supplemental funding is available specifically for undergraduate researchers, and primary investigators routinely ask for this funding on National Science Foundation proposals.\nIn addition, undergraduate students can receive reimbursement for travel expenses to conferences when their papers are accepted.\nSara SoodAssociate Chair for Undergraduate EducationPhone: 847-491-5708 Email Sara\n• Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning\n• Computer Engineering (in collaboration with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering)\n• Vision and Graphics\n• Human-Computer Interaction and Information Visualization\n• Programming Languages\n• Robotics\n• Systems and Networking\n• Security and Privacy\n• Theory\n• Research Track\n• Senior Thesis\n• Engineering Home\n• CS Department\n• Academics\n• Undergraduate\n• Undergraduate Research\n• How To Apply\n• Undergraduate Admissions\n• Financial Aid\n• Housing\n• Visit Us\n• Our Whole-Brain Engineering Philosophy",

The classes described below can be taken on an individual basis to explore the field of computer science. Should you become more interested, consider pursuing a minor or major in Computer Science.\nThis is an introductory course on the fundamentals of computer programming recommended for students considering a CS major or minor. The course is appropriate for all students, regardless of whether they have a background in high school computer science.\nThis class is an opportunity for students to see what computer programming is all about, and (more importantly) to see whether students want to spend the next few years doing more of it. This course will include weekly programming projects, readings, a midterm, and final examinations. Class participation is not optional.\nThis course is an introduction to computer programming using Python and assumes no prior programming knowledge. COMP_SCI 110 is not part of the CS major and is the recommended entry point for non-CS majors interested in learning the fundamental constructs of computer programming along with skills and strategies to apply them in creative and useful ways.\nStudents will gain some experience writing programs, working with the command line, working with different kinds of data, and participating in several important programming practices (e.g. debugging, testing, and designing programs; reading technical documentation and sample code; installing and exploring third-party modules and APIs).\nLearn more about our degree programs:\nBachelor of Science in Computer Science\nBachelor of Arts in Computer Science through the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences\nBachelor of Science in Computer Engineering joint with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering\nMinor in Computer Science\nMachine Learning and Data Science Minor joint with the Department of Industrial Engineering and Management Sciences\nCombined BS/MS option through which students can earn both degrees simultaneously\nSara SoodAssociate Chair for Undergraduate EducationPhone: 847-491-5708 Email Sara\n• Engineering Home\n• CS Department\n• Academics\n• Undergraduate\n• Intro Courses\n• How To Apply\n• Undergraduate Admissions\n• Financial Aid\n• Housing\n• Visit Us\n• Our Whole-Brain Engineering Philosophy",
