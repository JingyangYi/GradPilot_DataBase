It offers students a chance to become part of the elite program of the Bavarian Graduate School of Computational Engineering (BGCE).\nCourse Homepage\nWinter semester: 01.02. – 31.05\nComputational Science and Engineering (CSE) is a rapidly developing field that brings together applied mathematics (especially numerical analysis), computer science, and scientific or engineering applications. CSE focuses on developing problem-solving methodologies and robust tools for numerical simulation. To understand phenomena and processes from science and engineering, we no longer need to depend only on theory and experiment, but can also use computations. Numerical simulations supplement experiments and can even allow the examination of systems and problems that would be too time-consuming, expensive, or dangerous (if possible at all) to study by experiment alone.\nThe high level of detail and realism in these simulations requires advanced skills in mathematical modeling, numerical analysis, efficient algorithms, computer architecture, software design and implementation, validation, and visualization of results. This program equips engineering, science, or mathematics graduates with the skills required for a successful professional or academic career in CSE.\nUpon graduating with a M.Sc. in Computational Science and Engineering, you possess a great portfolio of skills in the areas of Computer Science, Numerical Analysis, Scientific Computing as well as their relevant Applications, Methods and Techniques.\nComputer Science focuses on Advanced Programming, Computer Architecture and Networks, Fundamental Algorithms, Parallel Programming, Scientific Visualization, the Programming of Supercomputers and Patterns in Software Engineering.\nIn the area of Numerical Analysis, the core subjects offered are Numerical Programming and Parallel Numerics.\nYou have also gained theoretical as well as practical skills in scientific computing, and are capable of applying your theoretical knowledge in your individual focus area to questions of current research.\nGraduates of the master’s program in Computational Science and Engineering can look forward to an inspiring career. Considered an important and dynamic field, Computational Science and Engineering is an emerging discipline that extends into all fields from which it evolved – applied mathematics, engineering and science applications, high performance computing, and many more. Accordingly, job opportunities and career paths are diverse, constantly exploring new fields of application, and usually characterized by a high level of interdisciplinarity.\nThanks to their computational abilities, advanced programming skills and understanding of sophisticated models and algorithms, computational science and engineering graduates are high in demand to solve large-scale problems once thought to be unmanageable.\nThe Master’s in Computational Science and Engineering is a multidisciplinary program taught in English over four semesters. The first three semesters involve lectures, tutorials, and seminars, while the fourth semester is reserved for your master's thesis.\nThe program covers a wide range of subjects and research areas, including numerical analysis, computer science, scientific computing and diverse applications like computational physics, computational fluid dynamics, visualization, and many more. In order to ensure a broad spectrum of topics as well as excellent expertise in each field, the CSE program is offered in cooperation with seven TUM departments.\nAll of the program's mandatory modules are taught in English, but some modules offered within the application areas may be bilingual (German lectures and English course material, or vice versa) or conducted in German, thus giving a broader choice of application fields.\nRequired language skills for admission:\nYou need sufficient English language skills if you wish to apply for this program. Evidence of your language proficiency has to be submitted before the end of the application deadline. Learn more about recognized certificates and other ways to prove your English language skills.\nThis evidence of your language proficiency confirms that you comply with the minimum language requirements for admission to the program. Depending on the program and your individual background, it may be necessary for you to keep working on your language skills during your studies. Be sure to take a look at the services of our Language Center.\nLanguage of instruction:\nThe language of instruction for this program is English.\nThe tuition fees for international students from third countries for this degree program are 6,000 euros per semester.\nMany international students can have their fees waived or receive scholarships to finance them. You can find all information on waivers and scholarships here.\nPlease note: The semester fee as a contribution to the student union must be paid additionally. It varies depending on where you are studying. You can find all information on the semester fee here.\nMinimum requirements to apply for a Master's program at TUM are a recognized undergraduate degree (e.g. a Bachelor’s) and the successful completion of the aptitude assessment procedure. The aptitude assessment allows the TUM school to which you are applying to evaluate your individual talents and motivation for study.\nDuring the application period, you must apply through the TUMonline application portal and upload your application documents.\nHere you will find detailed information on the requirements for the documents you need to upload for application and admission to TUM.\nGenerally, applicants with a qualification for postgraduate studies (e.g. a Bachelor’s) obtained outside of Germany must have their documents reviewed in advance through uni-assist (Preliminary Documentation).\nWe may require additional documents depending on your educational background and your country of origin. Complete the online application to receive a comprehensive list of the required documents.\nWe may require additional documents depending on the type of educational background you earned and your country of origin.\nApplication period for winter semester: 01.01. – 31.05.\nInformation about applying for a higher subject semester\nDuring the application period, you must apply through the TUMonline application portal and upload your application documents. Please be aware that we can only process your application if you upload all required documents within the application period.\nWe will review your application as soon as it is complete. Please check your TUMonline account regularly, to see if we have any queries to your documents or if you have to amend one or more documents.\nAfter receiving admission, you will see in TUMonline which documents you have to submit for enrollment, and in which form.\nWe recommend that you submit the documents for enrollment as soon as possible after receiving admission. If individual documents are not available by then, you can submit them up to 5 weeks after the start of the lecture period. You will, however, only be enrolled once we have received all documents.\nYou can check the status of your application at any time in your TUMonline account.\nSelection takes place through an aptitude assessment procedure. The aptitude assessment is a two-part procedure after the submission of an official application to a program. In this procedure, the TUM school determines whether you meet the specific requirements for its Master’s degree program.\nIn the initial stages, the grades you obtained during your Bachelor’s program, as well as your written documents, will be evaluated using a point system. Depending on the amount of points accumulated, applicants are either immediately admitted, rejected, or invited to an admissions interview.\nQuestions about application and admission\nstudiumspam prevention@tum.de  +49 89 289 22245  Arcisstr. 21, Room 0144\nContact Hours\nGeneral Student Advising\nAppointments by arrangement in advance\nCSE Coordinators\ncoordinatorsspam prevention@cse.tum.de  +49 89 289 18630  Boltzmannstr. 3, Raum MI 02.05.057, 85748 Garching\n• Show convenient version of this site\n• Don't show this message again\n• Full Time\n• 4\n\t\t\t\tsemesters (fulltime)\n• 120 ECTS\n• Garching\n• Aptitude Assessment for Master\n• Winter Semester (October)\n• Student Fees:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t85.00 €\n• Tuition fees for international students\n• English\n• Degree program documentation for the master's program in Computational Science and Engineering (PDF, German)\n• Program structure & Overview of modules\n• Information on exams\n• Information on studying abroad\n• General Academic and Examination Regulations\n• Academic and Examination Regulations\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t(PDF 341 KB)\n• All regulations and legal framework concerning studies\n• Applying for a Master’s program: Application, admission requirements and more\n• Important information about your application from the TUM school or department\n• Degree Certificate and Diploma or Subject and Grade Transcript of Studies to Date\n• Proof of English Language Proficiency\n• Statement of purpose (Letter of Motivation)\n• Curricular Analysis\n• Complete and Current Résumé\n• Passport\n• Preliminary Documentation (VPD) if the qualification for graduate studies (e.g. a Bachelor’s) was obtained outside Germany)\n• Application for Enrollment (signed)\n• Degree Certificate and Diploma (authentic document)\n• Transcript of Records (authentic document)\n• Most Current Photo (as for ID)\n• Digital notification of your health insurance status from a German public health insurance provider (requested by applicant)\n• Aptitude Assessment for Master\n• Information on the Aptitude Assessment (German)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t(PDF 357 KB)\n[CARD]\nType of Study\n\t\t\n\nFull Time\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tStandard Duration of Studies\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\tsemesters (fulltime)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tCredits\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t120 ECTS\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tMain Locations\n\t\t\n\n\nGarching\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tApplication Period\n\t\t\nWinter semester: 01.02. – 31.05\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAdmission Category\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nAptitude Assessment for Master\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tStart of Degree Program\n\t\t\n\nWinter Semester (October)\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tCosts\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tStudent Fees:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t85.00 €\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTuition fees for international students\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n            Required Language Proficiency\n        \n\n\nEnglish\n[CARD]\nComputational Science and Engineering (CSE) is a rapidly developing field that brings together applied mathematics (especially numerical analysis), computer science, and scientific or engineering applications.

To do this, you need a credit transfer report.\nIn any case, be sure to contact your departmental student academic advisor before applying to a higher subject semester (Fachsemester). You can find the respective contact person in the search field at the bottom of this page.\nThe recognition process depends on your previous course of study:\nIf you apply for a degree program at TUM and have already completed courses in an identical or related program, your previous study periods will be officially recognized and you will be automatically assigned to the corresponding semester at TUM. After enrolling, you must apply for the recognition of your previously earned credits at your department.\nIf you apply for a degree program at TUM and have already completed courses in another, non-related program, you can make an application to have these courses recognized. If courses or previously earned credits are recognized to a certain amount, you will be placed in a higher subject semester (Fachsemester) of the degree program at TUM.\nThe recognition of credits is defined by the Bavarian University Law and the General Academic and Examination Regulations of TUM.\nPeriods of study from identical or related degree programs will be officially recognized. This means that at TUM you will be enrolled in the semester corresponding your previous study times. After your enrollment at TUM, you additionally have to apply for the recognition of your previously earned credits at your school.\nCredits from other, non-related degree programs can only be recognized if there is no essential difference between the acquired learning outcomes and those required in your TUM degree program. This can only be assessed after an in-depth review at the school upon application.\nStudy periods from identical or related degree programs will be recognized automatically. At TUM you will be enrolled in the semester corresponding to your previous study times. After your enrollment, you additionally have to apply for the recognition of your previously earned credits at your school. Please make sure to contact your departmental academic student advisor early on! You can search for the corresponding contact in the right margin column under “Departmental Student Advising”.\nIf you apply for a degree program at TUM and have already completed courses in another, non-related program, there are two different application processes to a higher subject semester (Fachsemester): the upstream and the downstream process. Please check the list below for the relevant process concerning your application.\nThe upstream process starts with a mandatory advising session at the school before the online application. There, you will discuss your previously earned credits with a representative of the school. You fill in the application form to a higher subject semester (Fachsemester) during the advising session. With the signature of the school, the application form turns into a credit transfer report. You can then apply online, and submit the credit transfer report together with the other application documents.\nThe downstream process starts with you applying directly via TUMonline. You fill in the application for the credit transfer report yourself and upload it together with the module descriptions and the grading system (not necessary if the German grading system was used) as one PDF-document during the online application. The relevant school then processes your application and decides whether sufficient credits can be recognized to place you in a higher subject semester (Fachsemester). Please contact the responsible departmental student advisor in advance, who will also be able to tell you the application deadlines.\nImportant: The credit transfer report should not be confused with the official procedure for recognizing previously earned credits, which can only be initiated once you have actually enrolled. The credit transfer report is always preliminary (except for programs with restricted admission) and the result may be changed after the official recognition process.\nLearn more about the recognition of previously earned credits\nPlease note: If you need to provide a Preliminary Documentation (VPD) from uni-assist for your application, please still apply for it for the first subject semester (Fachsemester).\nIn this list you will see how your school handles the recognition of credits. Be sure to contact the departmental student academic advisor of your desired program in any case.\nPlease consult with the contact persons for M.Sc. Radiation Biology and M.Sc. Biomedical Neuroscience.\nStudents of Medicine can find all information on how to apply at www.tum.de/en/studies/application/medical-studies/medicine-clinical-work.\nYou will have to submit\nYou have to submit these documents to the Admissions and Enrollment Office by the end of the application deadline for the desired program to the school for application and admission, just like the rest of your application documents. Please contact the responsible departmental student advisors as early as possible; they will also be able to tell you the application deadlines.\nImportant: Enrollment at TUM in a higher subject semester (Fachsemester) is not possible without the credit transfer report! Make sure to contact your departmental student academic advisor early on.\nFor degree programs with restricted admission (numerus clausus), the credit transfer report has to be completed by the end of the application period, even if it is a downstream process.

You can search for the corresponding contact in the right margin column under “Departmental Student Advising”.\nIf you apply for a degree program at TUM and have already completed courses in another, non-related program, there are two different application processes to a higher subject semester (Fachsemester): the upstream and the downstream process. Please check the list below for the relevant process concerning your application. \nThe upstream process starts with a mandatory advising session at the school before the online application. There, you will discuss your previously earned credits with a representative of the school. You fill in the application form to a higher subject semester (Fachsemester) during the advising session. With the signature of the school, the application form turns into a credit transfer report. You can then apply online, and submit the credit transfer report together with the other application documents. \nThe downstream process starts with you applying directly via TUMonline. You fill in the application for the credit transfer report yourself and upload it together with the module descriptions and the grading system (not necessary if the German grading system was used) as one PDF-document during the online application. The relevant school then processes your application and decides whether sufficient credits can be recognized to place you in a higher subject semester (Fachsemester). Please contact the responsible departmental student advisor in advance, who will also be able to tell you the application deadlines.\nImportant: The credit transfer report should not be confused with the official procedure for recognizing previously earned credits, which can only be initiated once you have actually enrolled. The credit transfer report is always preliminary (except for programs with restricted admission) and the result may be changed after the official recognition process. \nLearn more about the recognition of previously earned credits\nPlease note: If you need to provide a Preliminary Documentation (VPD) from uni-assist for your application, please still apply for it for the first subject semester (Fachsemester).\n[CARD]\nIn this list you will see how your school handles the recognition of credits.

CSE focuses on developing problem-solving methodologies and robust tools for numerical simulation. To understand phenomena and processes in science and engineering, we no longer have to rely solely on theories and experiments, but can also use computations. Numerical simulations can complement experiments and can even enable the study of systems and problems that would be too time-consuming, too expensive, or too dangerous (if possible at all) using experiments alone.\nThe high level of detail and realism of these simulations requires advanced skills in mathematical modeling, numerical analysis, efficient algorithms, computer architecture, software design and implementation, as well as validation and visualization of results. This program equips engineering, science, or mathematics graduates with the skills needed for a successful professional or academic career in CSE.\nFor more details:\nType of Study: Full-time\nStandard Duration of Studies: 4 Semesters\nCredits: 120 ECTS\nMain Locations: Garching\nStart of Degree Program: Winter Semester\nLanguage of Instruction: English\nCosts: semester fee, tuition fees for international students from non-EU countries\nProfessional Profile: Informatics\nThe Master’s program in Computational Science and Engineering is a multidisciplinary program where the first three semesters focus on lectures, tutorials, and seminars, and the fourth semester is reserved for the Master's thesis.\nThe program covers a wide range of subjects and research areas, including numerical analysis, computer science, scientific computing and various applications such as computational physics, computational fluid dynamics, visualization, and many more. To ensure a broad range of topics as well as excellent expertise in each area, the CSE program is offered in cooperation with several TUM departments across three TUM schools (CIT, NAT, and ED).\nAll mandatory modules of the program are taught in English, but some modules within the application areas may be offered bilingually (German lectures and English course material, or vice versa) or be conducted in German, which would allow a broader choice of application areas.\nWith the degree in M.Sc. in Computational Science and Engineering, you will have a comprehensive portfolio of skills in computer science, numerical analysis, scientific computing, and their relevant applications, methods, and techniques.\nThe Computer Science curriculum includes the core subjects Advanced Programming and Parallel Programming, as well as a choice between Computer Architecture and Networks, Basic Algorithms, Scientific Visualization, and Patterns in Software Engineering.\nIn Numerical Analysis, the focus is on Numerical Programming and Numerical Algorithms for High Performance Computing.\nIn addition, you will have acquired both theoretical and practical skills in scientific computing and will be able to apply your theoretical knowledge to current research questions in your individual area of focus.\nGraduates of the Master's program in Computational Science and Engineering can look forward to inspiring careers in this important and dynamic field. Computational Science and Engineering is an emerging discipline that spans all the fields from which it evolved – applied mathematics, engineering and science applications, high-performance computing, and many more. Consequently, the employment opportunities and career paths available to graduates of the program are diverse, constantly exploring new areas of application, and typically characterized by a high degree of interdisciplinarity.\nThanks to their computational skills, advanced programming skills, and understanding of sophisticated models and algorithms, graduates in Computational Science and Engineering are in demand to solve large-scale problems that were once considered unsolvable.\nPlease be aware that starting from Winter Semester 2024/25, tuition fees will be charged for students from third countries (outside the European Economic Area). Merit- and need-based scholarships/waivers for these fees will, however, be available. For more information, please refer to: www.tum.de/en/studies/fees/tuition\nThe program is open to students with a bachelor's or master's degree in a science or engineering discipline. Graduates in Computer Science, Applied Mathematics or similar areas can also apply, if they followed a suitably interdisciplinary study program.\nPlease note that CSE is not a computer science program, and students who wish to pursue such a program are not encouraged to apply to CSE. If you are interested in computer science or computer engineering, the Informatics Master's program is for you. The same is true if your primary interest is Robotics or Machine Learning, as these other programs would likely be a better fit for you.\nIf you have a degree in a computer-related or mathematical discipline, you will need to demonstrate sufficient expertise in an engineering or science subject. This can be accomplished, for example, by completing an appropriate minor.\nIn addition, you will have to demonstrate the following skills\nThe aptitude test assessment the M.Sc. Computational Science and Engineering is a two-stage process in which we assess your qualifications with regard to the special qualitative requirements of this Master's program. Depending on the results of the first stage, you may be accepted directly, rejected directly, or invited to a telephone interview for the second stage of the selection process.\nWinter semester: 1 February – 31 May\nNote: International applicants are advised to apply early (e.g. by 31 March) to avoid delays in visa procedures and other formal processes. You can still apply by the usual deadline, but risk missing introductory events (if further steps take longer).\nYou have to apply for the Master's degree via TUMonline. After you have created your account in TUMonline, please enter the requested personal data and information about your education, and upload the required documents. The application is completely electronic.\nProspective students with a Bachelor's degree from outside Germany must request a preliminary examination documentation from uni-assist (VPD) in advance. This also applies to EU candidates!\nOnly in case of admission you will have to submit some additional documents as certified copies for enrollment.\nApplication for a Master's program - step by step\nGeneral application information portal\nThe following documents have to be submitted for the application (the required documents may vary depending on the applicant):\nRequired admission documents for some applicants:\nOptional admission documents:\nThe following documents are not mandatory but help us to get a better impression of the applicant:\nInternational applicants:\nAttention: If you did not obtain your Bachelor's degree in a German University, you have to upload a preliminary documentation from uni-assist (VPD). Note that this also applies to EU/EEA applicants! To get the VPD, you must send the required documents (some as notarized copies!) to uni-assist via post! Uni-assist still needs the documents in paper. As the issuance of the VPD usually takes around 4 weeks (but is known to take longer at times!), we highly recommend sending the necessary documents to uni-assist very early. More information on Preliminary Documentation (VPD) by uni-assist.\nAlso, candidates from specific countries are subject to additional requirements (as indicated above). For more information, check this page.\nPlease check the requirements for Notarization, especially for translations!Special requirements for documents apply to certain countries.\nThe admissions office checks whether your uploaded documents are complete and correct. If this is the case, the department can view your application and forward it to the admissions committee. The admissions committee decides whether your application will be admitted, rejected, or forwarded to the second stage of the aptitude assessment.\nFor your convenience, a checklist of all documents that are required to apply for CSE can be found here. Please use it, and do not forget any mandatory documents, because this hinders the processing of your application (i.e., it will not be forwarded to the admission committee until complete).\nWe have also created a detailed application guide that should answer the most common questions. The guide can be downloaded here. Please read it carefully.\nNOTE: All fields in the forms provided are digitally fillable, except for the signature fields. If the fields do not display properly or behave unexpectedly (values disappear or are duplicated), please download the file again using a different browser: Firefox is known to work, while there are problems with Chromium-based browsers.\nIf you have any trouble, please check our FAQs.\nApplicants who have not acquired their qualification for postgraduate studies (usually Bachelor) in a German institution must apply for a preliminary documentation (VPD) at uni-assist, in addition to the TUM application. Note that this requirement therefore applies to non-German EU/EEA applicants too.\nWhich documents have to be submitted to uni-assist?\nYou do not have to submit a complete application for a specific program to uni-assist, you only have to apply for the general preliminary documentation (VPD).\nAn application for a VPD via uni-assist alone does not qualify as an application for a degree program at TUM.\nApplicants with a Degree from Bangladesh, China, India, Iran or Pakistan have to submit a GRE (General) Test. We have defined required minimum scores, lower scores will not be accepted.\nThe required scores are:\nInstitution Code: 7806, Department: 5199 (\"all other departments\").\nFor Applicants from India:\nAs an applicant from India, you can submit a scorecard of the Indian GATE test (in an engineering field!) as an alternative if you are not from an IIT. The minimum qualifying score for the relevant year is required. Students from an IIT can directly upload their transcript in the application portal instead of GRE or GATE.\nApplicants with an undergraduate degree from China, India and Vietnam have to submit a certificate from the German Evaluation Center (APS).\nThe program is open to students who have earned a Bachelor's or Master's degree in one of the following disciplines:\nIf you have a degree in a computer-related or mathematical discipline, you must demonstrate sufficient knowledge in an engineering or science subject. This can be done, for example, by taking the appropriate subject as a minor.\nIn addition, you will need to prove you have the following skills:\nSolid basic knowledge in mathematics is indispensable for participation in the CSE Master's program. You should be able to demonstrate good knowledge in the topics taught in the mathematics courses of a German Bachelor in Engineering, i.e. linear algebra and integral and vector calculus, in the best case also numerics and stochastics.\nBesides the solid basic knowledge in mathematics, skills in a modern (object-oriented) programming language (e.g., C++, Java, Python, Fortran, Julia, Rust, etc.) are needed. These need to be demonstrated by courses taken as part of your previous degree program(s). You may also point out respective experience in your CV or via additional certificates.\nDepending on your specific course of study, you should also have solid skills in engineering fundamentals (technical mechanics, materials science, circuit theory, etc.) and/or natural sciences (physics, chemistry, biophysics, etc.), typically within the first 4-5 semesters of your studies, as well as advanced knowledge in the specific area of specialization corresponding to your course of study (generally, courses from the latter semesters). This could, for instance, comprise: thermodynamics, heat/mass transfer, mechanical processes, hydro-mechanics, thermal processes, reaction engineering, power engineering, control systems, communications engineering, sensor technology, theoretical physics, nuclear physics, quantum physics, statistical mechanics, biotechnology, organic chemistry, etc.\nPlease have a look at the bachelor programs at TUM and the corresponding number of ECTS in mathematical, programming, fundamentals and course-specific subjects:\nIf you graduated from a different program, please compare with the program which is closest to your program in terms of competences. As a rule of thumb, you should roughly have at least 25 ECTS in mathematics, 10 ECTS in programming, 50 ECTS in fundamentals, and 30 ECTS in your specialization. In any case, make sure to list all relevant courses in the curricular analysis document!\nThe assessment process for CSE is described in detail in the program-specific Academic and Examination Regulations (FPSO). A brief summary of this process is provided here for convenience.\nAssessment runs in two stages:\nStage 1: We assess your application documents based on the following criteria:\n≥55 points → Admission (✓)40–54 points → Proceed to Stage 2<40 points → Rejection (✗)\nStage 2: You'll be invited to an admission interview where we will ask about your motivation, background, previous experience, etc. (max. 45 points)\nThe scores from (*) and stage 2 are then added together:\n≥60 points → Admission (✓)<60 points → Rejection (✗)\nOnline application and submission of required documents\nFebruary 1 – March 31: recommended application deadline for applicants who need a visaFebruary 1 – May 31: compulsory application deadline\nNo submission of missing application documents after the official application deadline will be accepted!\nTime frame for interviews: April – September\nStart of program (lecture period)Winter semester: October 2024\nCheck here for exact dates.\nAll important information for the start of the program will be covered in the Informatics-wide orientation program.\nFor the successful completion of the Master's program in Computational Science and Engineering, 120 credits are required:\nDetailed information can be found below. For more information, see Degree Program Contents.\nList of required modules\nTo complete the CSE program, you must attend 49 ECTS of elective courses. The area of elective modules is split into 4 parts:\nA minimum number of ECTS must be obtained from each of the first three sections: 10 for Computer Science, 16 for Applied Mathematics, and 8 from a single catalog in section D. The remaining (up to 15) ECTS can be covered by elective modules from any section or catalog.\nThus, the above can be summarized as follows:\nYou must earn a total of at least 49 ECTS from elective modules, subject to the following rules.\nOverview of the elective modules\nThe advanced practical course (lab) is a mandatory module in which CSE students choose a practical lab course with a topic suitable for CSE. Students then usually work in groups on a larger project. Such a lab course has 10 ECTS and provides a large amount of practical and social skills.\nRegistration for practical courses typically follows the matching process. Read more about this under \"Course registration\".\nThe Seminar Scientific Computing is a special type of module, different from usual lectures or lab courses: It involves studying a selected topic with the individual guide of a TUM researcher. Students are then usually asked to write a scientific report and give a talk for the rest of the seminar participants. The grade is often determined by both the report and the talk.\nRegistration for seminar courses typically follows the matching process. Read more about this under \"Course registration\"\nRegistration for courses is usually done via TUMOnline. There you can look up lectures, tutor/exercise groups and exams – and register. Information about TUMOnline can be found here. Please note that registering for a lecture does not automatically mean registering for the corresponding tutor group, exercise group or exam. The same applies to retakes of exams: Each process is completely independent of the others. This means that you have to register separately in order to participate in the tutor group or the exam. Especially for exam registration, a late registration is not possible!\nPlease note that the registration modalities for certain courses might be slightly different: Seminars and lab courses, for example, may require participation in the matching process. In addition, a mandatory kickoff session is often offered. This usually takes place at the end of the semester prior to the semester in which the course is offered. This means that if you plan to attend a seminar in the summer 24 or winter 24/25 semester, you should find out how to register for the seminar and plan your studies one month before the end of the class period of the winter 23/24 or summer semester 24 respectively. If you miss the kickoff session, it may no longer be possible to register for the course or you may already be missing important information. In any case, please contact the course organizer directly instead of us, since we play no role in the matching process.\nThe Bavarian Graduate School of Computational Engineering (BGCE) is an association of three master’s programs:\nThe BGCE Honors Track, an elite program within the Bavarian Elite Network, offers additional courses to the most capable and dedicated students in each of the partner's degree programs. The Honors Track program aims to enhance both the academic training and personal skills of the selected students. The additional effort, in addition to outstanding performance in the regular master's program, is rewarded with excellent networking opportunities and the designation \"with honors,\" a hallmark of academic excellence.\nThe following documents contain the regulations for obtaining the \"Master of Science\" with honors degree:\nDetailed information can be found under Examinations.\nThe following regulations apply to all students:\nThe applicable version will depend on when you started:\nPlease note that the German versions of each set of regulations are the official documents; only the German text is legally binding. Where available, English translations of the regulations are provided for your convenience.\nFor the full list of examination regulations, please check Statutes & Regulations on tum.de.\nIt is possible to transfer credits from your previous studies (or from an exchange program) to your CSE degree plan. Recognition is regulated by APSO §16. There are three types of recognition:\nThe following information holds true for the first type of recognition. If you want to transfer examination results according to point two or three, please see below.\nIt is only possible to apply for a recognition during the first year of your CSE studies.\nTo obtain a recognition, you should submit the following four documents:\nIn the application form, please specify which CSE modules you would like to get recognized. You should also indicate which previous examination results you would like to be considered. It is possible to combine several previous examinations to fulfill the requirements of one CSE module. It is also possible to apply for more than just one module recognition. Please submit a form for each CSE module you wish to obtain recognition for.\nThe most important documents are the descriptions of the examinations from your previous studies. These should be as detailed possible to ensure that the contents of the examinations (lecture, exercise, seminar, practical course, etc.) cover all the contents of the CSE module. If your former university does not provide such a document, you will have to write the description yourself. You should sign the document to confirm that the description is accurate. The more detailed the description is, the greater the chances that it will be approved.\nTo prove that you actually passed the examination you want to get recognized for CSE, you must provide a transcript of records that includes the title of the exam, the scope of the course (amount of credits and/or duration) and the grade you received in the exam. The transcript must be either the original or a certified copy.\nTo transfer your previous grade into the German grading system, we need a grading table. This grading table must provide at least the following information: best possible grade, worst possible grade, and minimum grade to pass the examination.\nFill out the application form completely. Provide all required documents listed above and submit them to the CSE coordinators. To get an acceptance or rejection as soon as possible, please submit the application within the first four weeks of the winter term.\nAfter checking the formal requirements for the documents, they will be forwarded to the lecturers responsible for the respecitve module. They will check whether the content and scope of your previous examinations cover the content of the TUM module.\nYou will be informed by the secretary of CSE about the result and the transferred grade.\nFinally, you can decide whether to accept the recognition or not, e.g. to get a better grade in the TUM module. Once you have accepted the recognition, you cannot retake the TUM module exam to improve the transferred grade.\nThe recognition should be discussed individually with the CSE coordinators before the planned stay. Otherwise, chances are that the modules taken might not be recognized for the CSE.\nFree/additional courses (not used in the previous study's curriculum) or mandatory CSE modules (which have already been passed) can be transferred 1:1, meaning that you transfer a module from the former study program at TUM into the same module from the CSE program. In this case, please only fill out the application form for recognition.\nPlease be aware that CSE has its own examination board and, as such, some regulations differ from other Informatics' Programs. Most importantly, registration, submission, and (when applicable) extensions are processed via the CSE Coordinators and NOT via the Servicebüro Studium (SB-S-IN).\nThe master's thesis should preferably be started after all other program courses have been completed, but this is not a must. However, if the number of missing credits is too high, registration can and will be declined. As a policy, a person at TUM always defines the topic officially, but you can conduct your thesis in a variety of settings and get advice from people outside TUM:\nIn the last two cases, you will have to make sure that you still find an examiner at TUM from one of the CSE-related schools (formerly, one of the 7 related departments):\nThey will process your registration form and grade your thesis. In such a setting, often an external person acts as an assistant advisor/supervisor.\nThe CSE program coordinators often receive thesis offers from institutes at universities, various companies, or former CSE students. External offers for theses are usually sent by email, and/or posted at the bulletin board in front of the chair.\nEach thesis must be examined by one (or two) professor(s) (with “Prof.” or “PD” in their title), at least one of whom must be a faculty member at TUM. If you wish to complete your thesis at an external company, please make sure to find suitable examiners in time. Past students have experienced that it can be difficult to find professors willing to act as examiners for the master's thesis if they did not propose the topic.\nThe master's thesis should be written in English. The Examination Board may accept another language (specifically, German), but a summary in English must be included in that case. The summary should not exceed one page (15–20 lines are sufficient).\nNeed help writing in English? The English Writing Center offers free one-on-one English writing consultation to all members of the TUM community. This is a great offer that can improve the quality of your final thesis. Take a look at their website and feel free to book an appointment!\nFor a general overview of all formalities regarding the master's thesis, refer to this information. In particular, note that you must be enrolled throughout the working time of the thesis, up to the moment you submit (see thesis).\nThe aforementioned portal also includes a collection of tips and tricks regarding theses.\nThesis registration defines the topic and the intended start date, and should be submitted as soon as the topic and schedule are decided: This helps narrow the content of the project and sets a deadline for submission. We highly recommend that you submit an abstract of the thesis before officially registering for a topic, in order to ensure that the topic is appropriate for CSE. This is especially important if the thesis will be written at an external university, a company, or a non-CSE chair at TUM. Only topics that are related to CSE will be accepted!\nAs of the 15th of January 2024, theses are handled via the Koinon-School Portal to unify and digitize processes at the School of CIT, as well as ensuring that all involved parties are properly informed of any updates in the status of the thesis from registration through submission and final grading.\nFor consistency, we use the terms Supervisor (Betreuer in German) -- sometimes formerly referred to as advisor, and Examiner (Prüfer in German), corresponding to the evaluating Prof. or PD -- sometimes formerly referred to as supervisor.\nTo register for your master's thesis, your supervisor will need to enter your registration on the portal up to two weeks before the official starting date at the earliest (and max. two weeks after start at the latest). You will then be informed via email about the entry, which you have to confirm is correct. This includes theses examined by professors in other departments.\nIf there are issues with this workflow, please contact us and send your thesis proposal to the Examination Board (via email or in person to the secretary of the CSE examination board) using this registration form. (If you have two TUM examiners, please use this form instead.) The form ensures that the Examiner(s) agree(s) with supervising the thesis, as we will have to register you manually (in place of the supervisor).\nThe master's thesis must be submitted no later than six months after the start date.\nNote: Please make sure in advance that the chosen topic can be handled within the required timeframe. This is especially important if you plan to write your thesis at another university or an external institution, as they may be used to having more time to complete a thesis project.\nThe use of a proper typesetting system like LaTeX is strongly recommended. Please refer to the thesis guidelines and rules for form and delivery while you are working on the thesis. Since these thesis guidelines hold for theses of the Depts. of CS and CE programs, make sure you adapt them for CSE. Most importantly, ensure that all relevant information appears in the title pages, and make sure to include the signed Declaration of Own Work.\nAn unofficial template that fulfills all formal requirements for CSE can be found here (provided by Walter Simson). Feel free to use templates from other departments (particularly if writing a thesis with them), but make sure to adopt changes to conform to the CSE requirements!\nSubmission will now take place digitally via the Koinon-Portal. The deadline includes the specified day: i.e., deadline applies at 23:59 CE(S)T. Most importantly, make sure to indicate when your submission is final!\nAfter you submit your thesis, the Examiner(s) will receive a grading request. The examiner(s) usually need a few weeks for reviewing and grading. When having more than one examiner, the thesis grade is calculated by averaging the value of the two grades given by the examiners.\nCSE regulations before Winter Semester 2024/25 do not require thesis presentations, but some examiners choose to make them mandatory. Students starting from Winter Semester 2024/25 do have a mandatory presentation. If you are required to present your thesis, the examiner(s) will determine the presentation format, and you will be responsible for finding a date and room for the presentation. You are welcome to use the SCCS Colloquium for this purpose.\nPlease note: The submission date of your thesis is the official last date of your thesis work. Even if your presentation takes place after this date, the submission date will still be used for official purposes.\nIf you are unable to meet the submission deadline for any reason outside your control (i.e. access to resources/facilities, software/hardware failure, medical conditions, ...), you can request an extension adding appropriate documentation supporting your issues on the Koinon-Portal as well. Your examiner will be able to add a comment as well to confirm agreement with extensions for reasons other than health-related requests.\nPlease note that requesting additional time to improve results or polishing the work is not a valid reason for extension! Results deviating from expectations are, up to a point, also something which should be considered during topic definition, and therefore usually not a valid reason for extending the working time.\nIn general, if you are ill and prevented from working on the thesis, the working period will be paused according to the received medical certification. Please refer to the following link describing what the medical note must include in order to be considered valid.\nPlease send any extension request as soon as issues arise, and at least one week before the deadline, so that the extension can be processed in a timely manner. In addition, you should check, well in advance of the submission deadline, whether any circumstances that demand an extension have occurred.\nAfter successfully completing the course requirements and master’s thesis, you will graduate with a Master of Science (M.Sc.) degree and begin your professional life.

CSE focuses on developing problem-solving methodologies and robust tools for numerical simulation. To understand phenomena and processes in science and engineering, we no longer have to rely solely on theories and experiments, but can also use computations. Numerical simulations can complement experiments and can even enable the study of systems and problems that would be too time-consuming, too expensive, or too dangerous (if possible at all) using experiments alone.\nThe high level of detail and realism of these simulations requires advanced skills in mathematical modeling, numerical analysis, efficient algorithms, computer architecture, software design and implementation, as well as validation and visualization of results. This program equips engineering, science, or mathematics graduates with the skills needed for a successful professional or academic career in CSE.\nFor more details: The talk on \"Computational Science Education at the Technical University of Munich\" by the CSE program director Prof. Hans-Joachim Bungartz (from 2016) provides a broader perspective on the CSE study program.

To ensure a broad range of topics as well as excellent expertise in each area, the CSE program is offered in cooperation with several TUM departments across three TUM schools (CIT, NAT, and ED).\nAll mandatory modules of the program are taught in English, but some modules within the application areas may be offered bilingually (German lectures and English course material, or vice versa) or be conducted in German, which would allow a broader choice of application areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat further Expertise and Skills will I acquire?\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nWith the degree in M.Sc. in Computational Science and Engineering, you will have a comprehensive portfolio of skills in computer science, numerical analysis, scientific computing, and their relevant applications, methods, and techniques.\nThe Computer Science curriculum includes the core subjects Advanced Programming and Parallel Programming, as well as a choice between Computer Architecture and Networks, Basic Algorithms, Scientific Visualization, and Patterns in Software Engineering.\nIn Numerical Analysis, the focus is on Numerical Programming and Numerical Algorithms for High Performance Computing.\nIn addition, you will have acquired both theoretical and practical skills in scientific computing and will be able to apply your theoretical knowledge to current research questions in your individual area of focus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat Career Opportunities do I have afterwards?\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nGraduates of the Master's program in Computational Science and Engineering can look forward to inspiring careers in this important and dynamic field. Computational Science and Engineering is an emerging discipline that spans all the fields from which it evolved – applied mathematics, engineering and science applications, high-performance computing, and many more. Consequently, the employment opportunities and career paths available to graduates of the program are diverse, constantly exploring new areas of application, and typically characterized by a high degree of interdisciplinarity.\nThanks to their computational skills, advanced programming skills, and understanding of sophisticated models and algorithms, graduates in Computational Science and Engineering are in demand to solve large-scale problems that were once considered unsolvable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tDisclaimer: University semester fees\n\t\t\t\nPlease be aware that starting from Winter Semester 2024/25, tuition fees will be charged for students from third countries (outside the European Economic Area). Merit- and need-based scholarships/waivers for these fees will, however, be available. For more information, please refer to: www.tum.de/en/studies/fees/tuition\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tApplication and Admission\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nPartitioning of the surface of a hammered shark\n\n\n\nThe program is open to students with a bachelor's or master's degree in a science or engineering discipline. Graduates in Computer Science, Applied Mathematics or similar areas can also apply, if they followed a suitably interdisciplinary study program.\nPlease note that CSE is not a computer science program, and students who wish to pursue such a program are not encouraged to apply to CSE. If you are interested in computer science or computer engineering, the Informatics Master's program is for you. The same is true if your primary interest is Robotics or Machine Learning, as these other programs would likely be a better fit for you.\nIf you have a degree in a computer-related or mathematical discipline, you will need to demonstrate sufficient expertise in an engineering or science subject. This can be accomplished, for example, by completing an appropriate minor.\nIn addition, you will have to demonstrate the following skills A solid understanding of mathematics at an advanced level (see \"Solid basic knowledge of mathematics\" below). Knowledge of a modern programming language, e.g. C++, Java, Python, Fortran (see \"Solid basic programming skills\" below) Very good English language skills (see here) The aptitude test assessment the M.Sc. Computational Science and Engineering is a two-stage process in which we assess your qualifications with regard to the special qualitative requirements of this Master's program. Depending on the results of the first stage, you may be accepted directly, rejected directly, or invited to a telephone interview for the second stage of the selection process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tApplication Periods\n\t\t\t\nWinter semester: 1 February – 31 May\nNote: International applicants are advised to apply early (e.g. by 31 March) to avoid delays in visa procedures and other formal processes. You can still apply by the usual deadline, but risk missing introductory events (if further steps take longer).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHow do I apply?\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have to apply for the Master's degree via TUMonline. After you have created your account in TUMonline, please enter the requested personal data and information about your education, and upload the required documents. The application is completely electronic.\nProspective students with a Bachelor's degree from outside Germany must request a preliminary examination documentation from uni-assist (VPD) in advance. This also applies to EU candidates!\nOnly in case of admission you will have to submit some additional documents as certified copies for enrollment.\nApplication for a Master's program - step by step\nGeneral application information portal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnline Application at TUM | A TUMonline Tutorial\n\n                    \n                    \n                    Durch Klicken erklären Sie sich mit der Datenschutzerklärung von Google und unserer Datenschutzerklärung einverstanden.\n                    \n                        Mehr Informationen\n\n\n\nEinmalig aktivieren\nDauerhaft aktivieren\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWhich Documents do I need to submit with my Application?\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nThe following documents have to be submitted for the application (the required documents may vary depending on the applicant):A personal statement (letter of motivation) explaining why you have chosen this particular Master’s program and TUM specifically. Please use this form.Analysis of Curriculum. Please use this form.Module descriptions for the courses listed in your transcript and/or analysis of curriculum.Your CV/résumé (Europass and other formats are accepted)Bachelor's degree certificate, including a list of courses and grades OR an official transcript of records.

This means that EU/EEA applicants also need to submit this!APS certificate for applicants with a Bachelor's from China, Vietnam or India (as part of your preliminary documentation and later on for enrollment)Optional admission documents:\nThe following documents are not mandatory but help us to get a better impression of the applicant:Up to two letters of recommendation. Please use this form.A statement certified by your university to confirm your ranking on your former program  (e.g. 3rd best student in a class of 50 graduates)Certificates from professional training or additional qualifications related to the program (e.g. participation in research competitions, internships, etc.)Description of the grading system of your former university (appended to your transcript)Certified copy of university entrance qualification (appended to your additional qualifications)International applicants:\nAttention: If you did not obtain your Bachelor's degree in a German University, you have to upload a preliminary documentation from uni-assist (VPD). Note that this also applies to EU/EEA applicants! To get the VPD, you must send the required documents (some as notarized copies!) to uni-assist via post! Uni-assist still needs the documents in paper. As the issuance of the VPD usually takes around 4 weeks (but is known to take longer at times!), we highly recommend sending the necessary documents to uni-assist very early. More information on Preliminary Documentation (VPD) by uni-assist.\nAlso, candidates from specific countries are subject to additional requirements (as indicated above). For more information, check this page.\nPlease check the requirements for Notarization, especially for translations!Special requirements for documents apply to certain countries.\nThe admissions office checks whether your uploaded documents are complete and correct. If this is the case, the department can view your application and forward it to the admissions committee. The admissions committee decides whether your application will be admitted, rejected, or forwarded to the second stage of the aptitude assessment.\nFor your convenience, a checklist of all documents that are required to apply for CSE can be found here. Please use it, and do not forget any mandatory documents, because this hinders the processing of your application (i.e., it will not be forwarded to the admission committee until complete).\nWe have also created a detailed application guide that should answer the most common questions. The guide can be downloaded here. Please read it carefully.\nNOTE: All fields in the forms provided are digitally fillable, except for the signature fields. If the fields do not display properly or behave unexpectedly (values disappear or are duplicated), please download the file again using a different browser: Firefox is known to work, while there are problems with Chromium-based browsers.\nIf you have any trouble, please check our FAQs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat do I have to consider if I come from abroad? (VPD, GRE, APS)?\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nPreliminary documentation from uni-assist (VPD)\nApplicants who have not acquired their qualification for postgraduate studies (usually Bachelor) in a German institution must apply for a preliminary documentation (VPD) at uni-assist, in addition to the TUM application. Note that this requirement therefore applies to non-German EU/EEA applicants too. \nWhich documents have to be submitted to uni-assist?Completed application form for VPD (see Downloads)a copy of your degree certificate (if available)a copy of your Transcript of Recordsa translation, if the original documents are not in German or Englishif required: Certificate of the German Academic Evaluation Center (APS)You do not have to submit a complete application for a specific program to uni-assist, you only have to apply for the general preliminary documentation (VPD).\nAn application for a VPD via uni-assist alone does not qualify as an application for a degree program at TUM.\nGRE and GATE\nApplicants with a Degree from Bangladesh, China, India, Iran or Pakistan have to submit a GRE (General) Test. We have defined required minimum scores, lower scores will not be accepted.\nThe required scores are:Verbal reasoning: (will not be taken into account anymore)Numerical reasoning: 164 (effective 1 September 2022)Analytical writing: 4.0 (effective 1 September 2022)Institution Code: 7806, Department: 5199 (\"all other departments\").\nFor Applicants from India:\nAs an applicant from India, you can submit a scorecard of the Indian GATE test (in an engineering field!) as an alternative if you are not from an IIT. The minimum qualifying score for the relevant year is required. Students from an IIT can directly upload their transcript in the application portal instead of GRE or GATE.\nCertificate from the German Evaluation Center (Akademischen Prüfstelle, APS)\nApplicants with an undergraduate degree from China, India and Vietnam have to submit a certificate from the German Evaluation Center (APS).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tQualification Requirements and Assessment Process\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nThe program is open to students who have earned a Bachelor's or Master's degree in one of the following disciplines:Engineering (e.g. mechanical, civil, electrical, etc.)Science (e.g. physics, biology, chemistry, etc.)Informatics / computer science (be aware that CSE is not Computer Science, M.Sc. Informatics)Applied mathematicsan equivalent subjectIf you have a degree in a computer-related or mathematical discipline, you must demonstrate sufficient knowledge in an engineering or science subject. This can be done, for example, by taking the appropriate subject as a minor.\nIn addition, you will need to prove you have the following skills:\nSolid basic knowledge in mathematics\nSolid basic knowledge in mathematics is indispensable for participation in the CSE Master's program. You should be able to demonstrate good knowledge in the topics taught in the mathematics courses of a German Bachelor in Engineering, i.e. linear algebra and integral and vector calculus, in the best case also numerics and stochastics.\nSolid basic programming skills\nBesides the solid basic knowledge in mathematics, skills in a modern (object-oriented) programming language (e.g., C++, Java, Python, Fortran, Julia, Rust, etc.) are needed. These need to be demonstrated by courses taken as part of your previous degree program(s). You may also point out respective experience in your CV or via additional certificates.\nSolid fundamentals and subject-specific knowledge in engineering and/or natural sciences\nDepending on your specific course of study, you should also have solid skills in engineering fundamentals (technical mechanics, materials science, circuit theory, etc.) and/or natural sciences (physics, chemistry, biophysics, etc.), typically within the first 4-5 semesters of your studies, as well as advanced knowledge in the specific area of specialization corresponding to your course of study (generally, courses from the latter semesters). This could, for instance, comprise: thermodynamics, heat/mass transfer, mechanical processes, hydro-mechanics, thermal processes, reaction engineering, power engineering, control systems, communications engineering, sensor technology, theoretical physics, nuclear physics, quantum physics, statistical mechanics, biotechnology, organic chemistry, etc.\nPlease have a look at the bachelor programs at TUM and the corresponding number of ECTS in mathematical, programming, fundamentals and course-specific subjects:Mechanical EngineeringCivil EngineeringElectrical and Computer EngineeringPhysicsBiochemistryIf you graduated from a different program, please compare with the program which is closest to your program in terms of competences. As a rule of thumb, you should roughly have at least 25 ECTS in mathematics, 10 ECTS in programming, 50 ECTS in fundamentals, and 30 ECTS in your specialization. In any case, make sure to list all relevant courses in the curricular analysis document!\nAssessment Process\nThe assessment process for CSE is described in detail in the program-specific Academic and Examination Regulations (FPSO). A brief summary of this process is provided here for convenience.\nAssessment runs in two stages:\nStage 1: We assess your application documents based on the following criteria:Academic background and relevant competencies (max. 40 points) (*):Solid basic knowledge in mathematics (10 points)Solid basic programming skills (10 points)Solid fundamentals and subject-specific knowledge in engineering and/or natural sciencesFundamentals (10 points)Subject-specific knowledge (10 points)Grade Point Average (max. 15 points) (*)Motivational Letter (plus CV and additional documents) (max. 25 points)≥55 points → Admission (✓)40–54 points → Proceed to Stage 2<40 points → Rejection (✗)\nStage 2: You'll be invited to an admission interview where we will ask about your motivation, background, previous experience, etc. (max. 45 points)\nThe scores from (*) and stage 2 are then added together:\n≥60 points → Admission (✓)<60 points → Rejection (✗)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTimetable and Deadlines\n\t\t\t\nOnline application and submission of required documents\nFebruary 1 – March 31: recommended application deadline for applicants who need a visaFebruary 1 – May 31: compulsory application deadline\nNo submission of missing application documents after the official application deadline will be accepted!\nTime frame for interviews: April – September\nStart of program (lecture period)Winter semester: October 2024\nCheck here for exact dates. \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tDuring your Studies\n\t\t\t\nAll important information for the start of the program will be covered in the Informatics-wide orientation program.\nFor the successful completion of the Master's program in Computational Science and Engineering, 120 credits are required: Lectures, exercises, and practical courses from required and elective modules (90 Credits) Master's Thesis (30 Credits) Detailed information can be found below. For more information, see Degree Program Contents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRequired Modules\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n Computer Science, required (Section A): 10 Credits Scientific Computing (Section C): 31 Credits \tThis includes a seminar (5 ECTS) and a practical course (10 ECTS) which can be chosen according to your interests.   List of required modules\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tElective Modules\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nTo complete the CSE program, you must attend 49 ECTS of elective courses. The area of elective modules is split into 4 parts: Computer science – electives (section A) Applied mathematics (section B) Application areas of CSE (section D). This section is further split into 6 different catalogs Other electives (section E) A minimum number of ECTS must be obtained from each of the first three sections: 10 for Computer Science, 16 for Applied Mathematics, and 8 from a single catalog in section D. The remaining (up to 15) ECTS can be covered by elective modules from any section or catalog.\nThus, the above can be summarized as follows:\nYou must earn a total of at least 49 ECTS from elective modules, subject to the following rules. You must earn at least 10 ECTS from the section A electives. You must earn at least 16 ECTS from the section B electives. You must earn at least 8 ECTS from one D catalog. Remaining ECTS (up to 15) can be earned from any section or catalog. Overview of the elective modules\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAdvanced Practical Course CSE\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nThe advanced practical course (lab) is a mandatory module in which CSE students choose a practical lab course with a topic suitable for CSE. Students then usually work in groups on a larger project. Such a lab course has 10 ECTS and provides a large amount of practical and social skills.\nRegistration for practical courses typically follows the matching process. Read more about this under \"Course registration\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCSE Seminar Scientific Computing \n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nThe Seminar Scientific Computing is a special type of module, different from usual lectures or lab courses: It involves studying a selected topic with the individual guide of a TUM researcher. Students are then usually asked to write a scientific report and give a talk for the rest of the seminar participants. The grade is often determined by both the report and the talk.\nRegistration for seminar courses typically follows the matching process. Read more about this under \"Course registration\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCourse & Exam Registration\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nRegistration for courses is usually done via TUMOnline. There you can look up lectures, tutor/exercise groups and exams – and register. Information about TUMOnline can be found here. Please note that registering for a lecture does not automatically mean registering for the corresponding tutor group, exercise group or exam. The same applies to retakes of exams: Each process is completely independent of the others. This means that you have to register separately in order to participate in the tutor group or the exam. Especially for exam registration, a late registration is not possible!\nPlease note that the registration modalities for certain courses might be slightly different: Seminars and lab courses, for example, may require participation in the matching process. In addition, a mandatory kickoff session is often offered. This usually takes place at the end of the semester prior to the semester in which the course is offered. This means that if you plan to attend a seminar in the summer 24 or winter 24/25 semester, you should find out how to register for the seminar and plan your studies one month before the end of the class period of the winter 23/24 or summer semester 24 respectively. If you miss the kickoff session, it may no longer be possible to register for the course or you may already be missing important information. In any case, please contact the course organizer directly instead of us, since we play no role in the matching process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCSE-specific Processes\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHonors Program\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nThe Bavarian Graduate School of Computational Engineering (BGCE) is an association of three master’s programs:Computational Science and Engineering (CSE, i.e., this program; taught at TUM)Computational Mechanics (COME, taught at TUM)Computational Engineering (CE) (at University Erlangen-Nuremberg)The BGCE Honors Track, an elite program within the Bavarian Elite Network, offers additional courses to the most capable and dedicated students in each of the partner's degree programs. The Honors Track program aims to enhance both the academic training and personal skills of the selected students. The additional effort, in addition to outstanding performance in the regular master's program, is rewarded with excellent networking opportunities and the designation \"with honors,\" a hallmark of academic excellence. \nThe following documents contain the regulations for obtaining the \"Master of Science\" with honors degree: Valid since...GermanEnglishExamination Regulations (FPSO)May 02, 2019PDF-Examination Regulations (FPSO)Apr 07, 2016PDF-Examination Regulations (FPSO)Aug 23, 2012PDF-Examination Regulations (FPSO)Apr 07, 2005PDF-The examination regulations from 2019 apply to students who started the Honor's Program in 2019 or later.The examination regulations from 2016 apply to students who started the Honor's Program in 2017 or later.The examination regulations from 2012 apply to students who started the Honor's Program in 2013 or later.The examination regulations from 2005 apply to students who started the Honor's Program in 2012 or earlier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tExaminations and Regulations\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nDetailed information can be found under Examinations.\nThe following regulations apply to all students:The General Examination and Study Regulations of TUM (Allgemeine Prüfungs- und Studienordnung, APSO - latest update from Feb. 13, 2024, latest full version from Aug. 08, 2022)The program-specific Academic and Examination Regulations (Fachprüfungs- und Studienordnung, FPSO - latest version from Feb. 19, 2024)The applicable version will depend on when you started:starting WS 2024/25: PDFafter WS 2021/22: PDFafter WS 2017/18: PDFafter WS 2012/13: PDFPlease note that the German versions of each set of regulations are the official documents; only the German text is legally binding. Where available, English translations of the regulations are provided for your convenience.\nFor the full list of examination regulations, please check Statutes & Regulations on tum.de.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRecognitions\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nIt is possible to transfer credits from your previous studies (or from an exchange program) to your CSE degree plan. Recognition is regulated by APSO §16. There are three types of recognition: Recognition of examinations taken at a higher education institution abroad, e.g. from your previous studies. Recognition of examinations taken during a stay abroad during your CSE studies. Consecutive recognition of examinations taken during a Bachelor's or Master's program at TUM. The following information holds true for the first type of recognition. If you want to transfer examination results according to point two or three, please see below.Regulations for recognition (from previous studies)\nIt is only possible to apply for a recognition during the first year of your CSE studies.\nDocuments for recognitionTo obtain a recognition, you should submit the following four documents: The application form for recognition. Please complete it and sign it. Detailed descriptions for the content of each examination from your previous degree program (ideally, an official course syllabus). A Transcript of Records verifying that you have successfully taken the exam and listing the grade you received in the exam. A grading table specifying the maximum possible grade and the minimum passing grade for the course. This will be used to transfer your grade into the German grading system. In the application form, please specify which CSE modules you would like to get recognized. You should also indicate which previous examination results you would like to be considered. It is possible to combine several previous examinations to fulfill the requirements of one CSE module. It is also possible to apply for more than just one module recognition. Please submit a form for each CSE module you wish to obtain recognition for.\nThe most important documents are the descriptions of the examinations from your previous studies. These should be as detailed possible to ensure that the contents of the examinations (lecture, exercise, seminar, practical course, etc.) cover all the contents of the CSE module. If your former university does not provide such a document, you will have to write the description yourself. You should sign the document to confirm that the description is accurate. The more detailed the description is, the greater the chances that it will be approved.\nTo prove that you actually passed the examination you want to get recognized for CSE, you must provide a transcript of records that includes the title of the exam, the scope of the course (amount of credits and/or duration) and the grade you received in the exam. The transcript must be either the original or a certified copy.\nTo transfer your previous grade into the German grading system, we need a grading table. This grading table must provide at least the following information: best possible grade, worst possible grade, and minimum grade to pass the examination.\nProcess of Recognition  Fill out the application form completely. Provide all required documents listed above and submit them to the CSE coordinators. To get an acceptance or rejection as soon as possible, please submit the application within the first four weeks of the winter term.   After checking the formal requirements for the documents, they will be forwarded to the lecturers responsible for the respecitve module. They will check whether the content and scope of your previous examinations cover the content of the TUM module.   You will be informed by the secretary of CSE about the result and the transferred grade.   Finally, you can decide whether to accept the recognition or not, e.g. to get a better grade in the TUM module. Once you have accepted the recognition, you cannot retake the TUM module exam to improve the transferred grade.  Regulations for recognition (from a stay abroad)\nThe recognition should be discussed individually with the CSE coordinators before the planned stay. Otherwise, chances are that the modules taken might not be recognized for the CSE.\nRegulations for recognition (from another study at TUM)\nFree/additional courses (not used in the previous study's curriculum) or mandatory CSE modules (which have already been passed) can be transferred 1:1, meaning that you transfer a module from the former study program at TUM into the same module from the CSE program. In this case, please only fill out the application form for recognition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThesis\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nPlease be aware that CSE has its own examination board and, as such, some regulations differ from other Informatics' Programs. Most importantly, registration, submission, and (when applicable) extensions are processed via the CSE Coordinators and NOT via the Servicebüro Studium (SB-S-IN).\nThe master's thesis should preferably be started after all other program courses have been completed, but this is not a must. However, if the number of missing credits is too high, registration can and will be declined. As a policy, a person at TUM always defines the topic officially, but you can conduct your thesis in a variety of settings and get advice from people outside TUM:Under the supervision of a TUM chairThis is the most common choice for CSE students. Visit the website where TUM thesis offers are published to have a first idea of what topics exist. However, not all thesis offers are posted on this website, and not all offers on the page apply to CSE! Another option is to visit the websites of the research groups that interest you (or the lecturers/tutors of your courses) and contact them directly: It never hurts to ask!At another university or research instituteVisit the university's or institute's website to search for a topic of interest.At a companyMany of our students start their thesis at a company where they have worked as an intern or a Werkstudent, for example.In the last two cases, you will have to make sure that you still find an examiner at TUM from one of the CSE-related schools (formerly, one of the 7 related departments):TUM School of Computation, Information, and Technology (CIT): comprising the former departments of Informatics (IN), Mathematics (MA), and Electrical and Computer Engineering (EI)TUM School of Engineering and Design (ED): comprising the former departments of Mechanical Engineering (MW), and Civil, Geo and Environmental Engineering (BGU), andTUM School of Natural Sciences (NAT): comprising the former departments of Physics (PH) and Chemistry (CH).They will process your registration form and grade your thesis. In such a setting, often an external person acts as an assistant advisor/supervisor.\nThe CSE program coordinators often receive thesis offers from institutes at universities, various companies, or former CSE students. External offers for theses are usually sent by email, and/or posted at the bulletin board in front of the chair.\nEach thesis must be examined by one (or two) professor(s) (with “Prof.” or “PD” in their title), at least one of whom must be a faculty member at TUM. If you wish to complete your thesis at an external company, please make sure to find suitable examiners in time. Past students have experienced that it can be difficult to find professors willing to act as examiners for the master's thesis if they did not propose the topic.\nThe master's thesis should be written in English. The Examination Board may accept another language (specifically, German), but a summary in English must be included in that case. The summary should not exceed one page (15–20 lines are sufficient).\nNeed help writing in English? The English Writing Center offers free one-on-one English writing consultation to all members of the TUM community. This is a great offer that can improve the quality of your final thesis. Take a look at their website and feel free to book an appointment!\nFor a general overview of all formalities regarding the master's thesis, refer to this information. In particular, note that you must be enrolled throughout the working time of the thesis, up to the moment you submit (see thesis).\nThe aforementioned portal also includes a collection of tips and tricks regarding theses.\nThesis Registration\nThesis registration defines the topic and the intended start date, and should be submitted as soon as the topic and schedule are decided: This helps narrow the content of the project and sets a deadline for submission. We highly recommend that you submit an abstract of the thesis before officially registering for a topic, in order to ensure that the topic is appropriate for CSE. This is especially important if the thesis will be written at an external university, a company, or a non-CSE chair at TUM. Only topics that are related to CSE will be accepted!\nAs of the 15th of January 2024, theses are handled via the Koinon-School Portal to unify and digitize processes at the School of CIT, as well as ensuring that all involved parties are properly informed of any updates in the status of the thesis from registration through submission and final grading.\nFor consistency, we use the terms Supervisor (Betreuer in German) -- sometimes formerly referred to as advisor, and Examiner (Prüfer in German), corresponding to the evaluating Prof. or PD -- sometimes formerly referred to as supervisor.\nTo register for your master's thesis, your supervisor will need to enter your registration on the portal up to two weeks before the official starting date at the earliest (and max. two weeks after start at the latest). You will then be informed via email about the entry, which you have to confirm is correct. This includes theses examined by professors in other departments.\nIf there are issues with this workflow, please contact us and send your thesis proposal to the Examination Board (via email or in person to the secretary of the CSE examination board) using this registration form. (If you have two TUM examiners, please use this form instead.) The form ensures that the Examiner(s) agree(s) with supervising the thesis, as we will have to register you manually (in place of the supervisor).\nSubmitting your Master's Thesis\nSubmission Deadline\nThe master's thesis must be submitted no later than six months after the start date.\nNote: Please make sure in advance that the chosen topic can be handled within the required timeframe. This is especially important if you plan to write your thesis at another university or an external institution, as they may be used to having more time to complete a thesis project.\nSubmission Requirements\nThe use of a proper typesetting system like LaTeX is strongly recommended. Please refer to the thesis guidelines and rules for form and delivery while you are working on the thesis. Since these thesis guidelines hold for theses of the Depts. of CS and CE programs, make sure you adapt them for CSE. Most importantly, ensure that all relevant information appears in the title pages, and make sure to include the signed Declaration of Own Work. \nAn unofficial template that fulfills all formal requirements for CSE can be found here (provided by Walter Simson). Feel free to use templates from other departments (particularly if writing a thesis with them), but make sure to adopt changes to conform to the CSE requirements!\nSubmission will now take place digitally via the Koinon-Portal. The deadline includes the specified day: i.e., deadline applies at 23:59 CE(S)T. Most importantly, make sure to indicate when your submission is final!\nThesis Grading\nAfter you submit your thesis, the Examiner(s) will receive a grading request. The examiner(s) usually need a few weeks for reviewing and grading. When having more than one examiner, the thesis grade is calculated by averaging the value of the two grades given by the examiners.\nThesis Presentation\nCSE regulations before Winter Semester 2024/25 do not require thesis presentations, but some examiners choose to make them mandatory. Students starting from Winter Semester 2024/25 do have a mandatory presentation. If you are required to present your thesis, the examiner(s) will determine the presentation format, and you will be responsible for finding a date and room for the presentation. You are welcome to use the SCCS Colloquium for this purpose.\nPlease note: The submission date of your thesis is the official last date of your thesis work. Even if your presentation takes place after this date, the submission date will still be used for official purposes.\nExtension of deadline\nIf you are unable to meet the submission deadline for any reason outside your control (i.e. access to resources/facilities, software/hardware failure, medical conditions, ...), you can request an extension adding appropriate documentation supporting your issues on the Koinon-Portal as well. Your examiner will be able to add a comment as well to confirm agreement with extensions for reasons other than health-related requests.\nPlease note that requesting additional time to improve results or polishing the work is not a valid reason for extension! Results deviating from expectations are, up to a point, also something which should be considered during topic definition, and therefore usually not a valid reason for extending the working time.\nIn general, if you are ill and prevented from working on the thesis, the working period will be paused according to the received medical certification. Please refer to the following link describing what the medical note must include in order to be considered valid.\nPlease send any extension request as soon as issues arise, and at least one week before the deadline, so that the extension can be processed in a timely manner. In addition, you should check, well in advance of the submission deadline, whether any circumstances that demand an extension have occurred.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGraduation\n\t\t\t\nAfter successfully completing the course requirements and master’s thesis, you will graduate with a Master of Science (M.Sc.) degree and begin your professional life.

Please note that registering for a lecture does not automatically mean registering for the corresponding tutor group, exercise group or exam. The same applies to retakes of exams: Each process is completely independent of the others. This means that you have to register separately in order to participate in the tutor group or the exam. Especially for exam registration, a late registration is not possible!\nPlease note that the registration modalities for certain courses might be slightly different: Seminars and lab courses, for example, may require participation in the matching process. In addition, a mandatory kickoff session is often offered. This usually takes place at the end of the semester prior to the semester in which the course is offered. This means that if you plan to attend a seminar in the summer 24 or winter 24/25 semester, you should find out how to register for the seminar and plan your studies one month before the end of the class period of the winter 23/24 or summer semester 24 respectively. If you miss the kickoff session, it may no longer be possible to register for the course or you may already be missing important information. In any case, please contact the course organizer directly instead of us, since we play no role in the matching process.\nCourse & Exam Registration\nRegistration for courses is usually done via TUMOnline.

In addition, a mandatory kickoff session is often offered. This usually takes place at the end of the semester prior to the semester in which the course is offered. This means that if you plan to attend a seminar in the summer 24 or winter 24/25 semester, you should find out how to register for the seminar and plan your studies one month before the end of the class period of the winter 23/24 or summer semester 24 respectively. If you miss the kickoff session, it may no longer be possible to register for the course or you may already be missing important information. In any case, please contact the course organizer directly instead of us, since we play no role in the matching process.\nHonors Program\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nThe Bavarian Graduate School of Computational Engineering (BGCE) is an association of three master’s programs:Computational Science and Engineering (CSE, i.e., this program; taught at TUM)Computational Mechanics (COME, taught at TUM)Computational Engineering (CE) (at University Erlangen-Nuremberg)The BGCE Honors Track, an elite program within the Bavarian Elite Network, offers additional courses to the most capable and dedicated students in each of the partner's degree programs.

Recognition is regulated by APSO §16. There are three types of recognition: Recognition of examinations taken at a higher education institution abroad, e.g. from your previous studies. Recognition of examinations taken during a stay abroad during your CSE studies. Consecutive recognition of examinations taken during a Bachelor's or Master's program at TUM. The following information holds true for the first type of recognition. If you want to transfer examination results according to point two or three, please see below.Regulations for recognition (from previous studies)\nIt is only possible to apply for a recognition during the first year of your CSE studies.\nDocuments for recognitionTo obtain a recognition, you should submit the following four documents: The application form for recognition. Please complete it and sign it. Detailed descriptions for the content of each examination from your previous degree program (ideally, an official course syllabus). A Transcript of Records verifying that you have successfully taken the exam and listing the grade you received in the exam. A grading table specifying the maximum possible grade and the minimum passing grade for the course. This will be used to transfer your grade into the German grading system. In the application form, please specify which CSE modules you would like to get recognized. You should also indicate which previous examination results you would like to be considered. It is possible to combine several previous examinations to fulfill the requirements of one CSE module. It is also possible to apply for more than just one module recognition. Please submit a form for each CSE module you wish to obtain recognition for.\nThe most important documents are the descriptions of the examinations from your previous studies. These should be as detailed possible to ensure that the contents of the examinations (lecture, exercise, seminar, practical course, etc.) cover all the contents of the CSE module. If your former university does not provide such a document, you will have to write the description yourself. You should sign the document to confirm that the description is accurate. The more detailed the description is, the greater the chances that it will be approved.\nTo prove that you actually passed the examination you want to get recognized for CSE, you must provide a transcript of records that includes the title of the exam, the scope of the course (amount of credits and/or duration) and the grade you received in the exam. The transcript must be either the original or a certified copy.\nTo transfer your previous grade into the German grading system, we need a grading table. This grading table must provide at least the following information: best possible grade, worst possible grade, and minimum grade to pass the examination.\nProcess of Recognition  Fill out the application form completely. Provide all required documents listed above and submit them to the CSE coordinators. To get an acceptance or rejection as soon as possible, please submit the application within the first four weeks of the winter term.   After checking the formal requirements for the documents, they will be forwarded to the lecturers responsible for the respecitve module. They will check whether the content and scope of your previous examinations cover the content of the TUM module.   You will be informed by the secretary of CSE about the result and the transferred grade.   Finally, you can decide whether to accept the recognition or not, e.g. to get a better grade in the TUM module. Once you have accepted the recognition, you cannot retake the TUM module exam to improve the transferred grade.  Regulations for recognition (from a stay abroad)\nThe recognition should be discussed individually with the CSE coordinators before the planned stay. Otherwise, chances are that the modules taken might not be recognized for the CSE.\nRegulations for recognition (from another study at TUM)\nFree/additional courses (not used in the previous study's curriculum) or mandatory CSE modules (which have already been passed) can be transferred 1:1, meaning that you transfer a module from the former study program at TUM into the same module from the CSE program. In this case, please only fill out the application form for recognition.\nRecognitions\nIt is possible to transfer credits from your previous studies (or from an exchange program) to your CSE degree plan.

Most importantly, registration, submission, and (when applicable) extensions are processed via the CSE Coordinators and NOT via the Servicebüro Studium (SB-S-IN).\nThe master's thesis should preferably be started after all other program courses have been completed, but this is not a must. However, if the number of missing credits is too high, registration can and will be declined. As a policy, a person at TUM always defines the topic officially, but you can conduct your thesis in a variety of settings and get advice from people outside TUM:Under the supervision of a TUM chairThis is the most common choice for CSE students. Visit the website where TUM thesis offers are published to have a first idea of what topics exist. However, not all thesis offers are posted on this website, and not all offers on the page apply to CSE! Another option is to visit the websites of the research groups that interest you (or the lecturers/tutors of your courses) and contact them directly: It never hurts to ask!At another university or research instituteVisit the university's or institute's website to search for a topic of interest.At a companyMany of our students start their thesis at a company where they have worked as an intern or a Werkstudent, for example.In the last two cases, you will have to make sure that you still find an examiner at TUM from one of the CSE-related schools (formerly, one of the 7 related departments):TUM School of Computation, Information, and Technology (CIT): comprising the former departments of Informatics (IN), Mathematics (MA), and Electrical and Computer Engineering (EI)TUM School of Engineering and Design (ED): comprising the former departments of Mechanical Engineering (MW), and Civil, Geo and Environmental Engineering (BGU), andTUM School of Natural Sciences (NAT): comprising the former departments of Physics (PH) and Chemistry (CH).They will process your registration form and grade your thesis. In such a setting, often an external person acts as an assistant advisor/supervisor.\nThe CSE program coordinators often receive thesis offers from institutes at universities, various companies, or former CSE students. External offers for theses are usually sent by email, and/or posted at the bulletin board in front of the chair.\nEach thesis must be examined by one (or two) professor(s) (with “Prof.” or “PD” in their title), at least one of whom must be a faculty member at TUM. If you wish to complete your thesis at an external company, please make sure to find suitable examiners in time. Past students have experienced that it can be difficult to find professors willing to act as examiners for the master's thesis if they did not propose the topic.\nThe master's thesis should be written in English. The Examination Board may accept another language (specifically, German), but a summary in English must be included in that case. The summary should not exceed one page (15–20 lines are sufficient).\nNeed help writing in English? The English Writing Center offers free one-on-one English writing consultation to all members of the TUM community. This is a great offer that can improve the quality of your final thesis. Take a look at their website and feel free to book an appointment!\nFor a general overview of all formalities regarding the master's thesis, refer to this information. In particular, note that you must be enrolled throughout the working time of the thesis, up to the moment you submit (see thesis).\nThe aforementioned portal also includes a collection of tips and tricks regarding theses.\nThesis Registration\nThesis registration defines the topic and the intended start date, and should be submitted as soon as the topic and schedule are decided: This helps narrow the content of the project and sets a deadline for submission. We highly recommend that you submit an abstract of the thesis before officially registering for a topic, in order to ensure that the topic is appropriate for CSE. This is especially important if the thesis will be written at an external university, a company, or a non-CSE chair at TUM. Only topics that are related to CSE will be accepted!\nAs of the 15th of January 2024, theses are handled via the Koinon-School Portal to unify and digitize processes at the School of CIT, as well as ensuring that all involved parties are properly informed of any updates in the status of the thesis from registration through submission and final grading.\nFor consistency, we use the terms Supervisor (Betreuer in German) -- sometimes formerly referred to as advisor, and Examiner (Prüfer in German), corresponding to the evaluating Prof. or PD -- sometimes formerly referred to as supervisor.\nTo register for your master's thesis, your supervisor will need to enter your registration on the portal up to two weeks before the official starting date at the earliest (and max. two weeks after start at the latest). You will then be informed via email about the entry, which you have to confirm is correct. This includes theses examined by professors in other departments.\nIf there are issues with this workflow, please contact us and send your thesis proposal to the Examination Board (via email or in person to the secretary of the CSE examination board) using this registration form. (If you have two TUM examiners, please use this form instead.) The form ensures that the Examiner(s) agree(s) with supervising the thesis, as we will have to register you manually (in place of the supervisor).\nSubmitting your Master's Thesis\nSubmission Deadline\nThe master's thesis must be submitted no later than six months after the start date.\nNote: Please make sure in advance that the chosen topic can be handled within the required timeframe. This is especially important if you plan to write your thesis at another university or an external institution, as they may be used to having more time to complete a thesis project.\nSubmission Requirements\nThe use of a proper typesetting system like LaTeX is strongly recommended. Please refer to the thesis guidelines and rules for form and delivery while you are working on the thesis. Since these thesis guidelines hold for theses of the Depts. of CS and CE programs, make sure you adapt them for CSE. Most importantly, ensure that all relevant information appears in the title pages, and make sure to include the signed Declaration of Own Work. \nAn unofficial template that fulfills all formal requirements for CSE can be found here (provided by Walter Simson). Feel free to use templates from other departments (particularly if writing a thesis with them), but make sure to adopt changes to conform to the CSE requirements!\nSubmission will now take place digitally via the Koinon-Portal. The deadline includes the specified day: i.e., deadline applies at 23:59 CE(S)T. Most importantly, make sure to indicate when your submission is final!\nThesis Grading\nAfter you submit your thesis, the Examiner(s) will receive a grading request. The examiner(s) usually need a few weeks for reviewing and grading. When having more than one examiner, the thesis grade is calculated by averaging the value of the two grades given by the examiners.\nThesis Presentation\nCSE regulations before Winter Semester 2024/25 do not require thesis presentations, but some examiners choose to make them mandatory. Students starting from Winter Semester 2024/25 do have a mandatory presentation. If you are required to present your thesis, the examiner(s) will determine the presentation format, and you will be responsible for finding a date and room for the presentation. You are welcome to use the SCCS Colloquium for this purpose.\nPlease note: The submission date of your thesis is the official last date of your thesis work. Even if your presentation takes place after this date, the submission date will still be used for official purposes.\nExtension of deadline\nIf you are unable to meet the submission deadline for any reason outside your control (i.e. access to resources/facilities, software/hardware failure, medical conditions, ...), you can request an extension adding appropriate documentation supporting your issues on the Koinon-Portal as well. Your examiner will be able to add a comment as well to confirm agreement with extensions for reasons other than health-related requests.\nPlease note that requesting additional time to improve results or polishing the work is not a valid reason for extension! Results deviating from expectations are, up to a point, also something which should be considered during topic definition, and therefore usually not a valid reason for extending the working time.\nIn general, if you are ill and prevented from working on the thesis, the working period will be paused according to the received medical certification. Please refer to the following link describing what the medical note must include in order to be considered valid.\nPlease send any extension request as soon as issues arise, and at least one week before the deadline, so that the extension can be processed in a timely manner. In addition, you should check, well in advance of the submission deadline, whether any circumstances that demand an extension have occurred.\nThesis\nPlease be aware that CSE has its own examination board and, as such, some regulations differ from other Informatics' Programs.

There you can look up lectures, tutor/exercise groups and exams – and register. Information about TUMOnline can be found here. Please note that registering for a lecture does not automatically mean registering for the corresponding tutor group, exercise group or exam. The same applies to retakes of exams: Each process is completely independent of the others. This means that you have to register separately in order to participate in the tutor group or the exam. Especially for exam registration, a late registration is not possible!\nPlease note that the registration modalities for certain courses might be slightly different: Seminars and lab courses, for example, may require participation in the matching process. In addition, a mandatory kickoff session is often offered. This usually takes place at the end of the semester prior to the semester in which the course is offered. This means that if you plan to attend a seminar in the summer 24 or winter 24/25 semester, you should find out how to register for the seminar and plan your studies one month before the end of the class period of the winter 23/24 or summer semester 24 respectively. If you miss the kickoff session, it may no longer be possible to register for the course or you may already be missing important information. In any case, please contact the course organizer directly instead of us, since we play no role in the matching process.\nCourse & Exam Registration\nRegistration for courses is usually done via TUMOnline.

Recognition is regulated by APSO §16. There are three types of recognition: Recognition of examinations taken at a higher education institution abroad, e.g. from your previous studies. Recognition of examinations taken during a stay abroad during your CSE studies. Consecutive recognition of examinations taken during a Bachelor's or Master's program at TUM. The following information holds true for the first type of recognition. If you want to transfer examination results according to point two or three, please see below.Regulations for recognition (from previous studies)\nIt is only possible to apply for a recognition during the first year of your CSE studies.\nDocuments for recognitionTo obtain a recognition, you should submit the following four documents: The application form for recognition. Please complete it and sign it. Detailed descriptions for the content of each examination from your previous degree program (ideally, an official course syllabus). A Transcript of Records verifying that you have successfully taken the exam and listing the grade you received in the exam. A grading table specifying the maximum possible grade and the minimum passing grade for the course. This will be used to transfer your grade into the German grading system. In the application form, please specify which CSE modules you would like to get recognized. You should also indicate which previous examination results you would like to be considered. It is possible to combine several previous examinations to fulfill the requirements of one CSE module. It is also possible to apply for more than just one module recognition. Please submit a form for each CSE module you wish to obtain recognition for.\nThe most important documents are the descriptions of the examinations from your previous studies. These should be as detailed possible to ensure that the contents of the examinations (lecture, exercise, seminar, practical course, etc.) cover all the contents of the CSE module. If your former university does not provide such a document, you will have to write the description yourself. You should sign the document to confirm that the description is accurate. The more detailed the description is, the greater the chances that it will be approved.\nTo prove that you actually passed the examination you want to get recognized for CSE, you must provide a transcript of records that includes the title of the exam, the scope of the course (amount of credits and/or duration) and the grade you received in the exam. The transcript must be either the original or a certified copy.\nTo transfer your previous grade into the German grading system, we need a grading table. This grading table must provide at least the following information: best possible grade, worst possible grade, and minimum grade to pass the examination.\nProcess of Recognition  Fill out the application form completely. Provide all required documents listed above and submit them to the CSE coordinators. To get an acceptance or rejection as soon as possible, please submit the application within the first four weeks of the winter term.   After checking the formal requirements for the documents, they will be forwarded to the lecturers responsible for the respecitve module. They will check whether the content and scope of your previous examinations cover the content of the TUM module.   You will be informed by the secretary of CSE about the result and the transferred grade.   Finally, you can decide whether to accept the recognition or not, e.g. to get a better grade in the TUM module. Once you have accepted the recognition, you cannot retake the TUM module exam to improve the transferred grade.  Regulations for recognition (from a stay abroad)\nThe recognition should be discussed individually with the CSE coordinators before the planned stay. Otherwise, chances are that the modules taken might not be recognized for the CSE.\nRegulations for recognition (from another study at TUM)\nFree/additional courses (not used in the previous study's curriculum) or mandatory CSE modules (which have already been passed) can be transferred 1:1, meaning that you transfer a module from the former study program at TUM into the same module from the CSE program. In this case, please only fill out the application form for recognition.\nRecognitions\nIt is possible to transfer credits from your previous studies (or from an exchange program) to your CSE degree plan.

Most importantly, registration, submission, and (when applicable) extensions are processed via the CSE Coordinators and NOT via the Servicebüro Studium (SB-S-IN).\nThe master's thesis should preferably be started after all other program courses have been completed, but this is not a must. However, if the number of missing credits is too high, registration can and will be declined. As a policy, a person at TUM always defines the topic officially, but you can conduct your thesis in a variety of settings and get advice from people outside TUM:Under the supervision of a TUM chairThis is the most common choice for CSE students. Visit the website where TUM thesis offers are published to have a first idea of what topics exist. However, not all thesis offers are posted on this website, and not all offers on the page apply to CSE! Another option is to visit the websites of the research groups that interest you (or the lecturers/tutors of your courses) and contact them directly: It never hurts to ask!At another university or research instituteVisit the university's or institute's website to search for a topic of interest.At a companyMany of our students start their thesis at a company where they have worked as an intern or a Werkstudent, for example.In the last two cases, you will have to make sure that you still find an examiner at TUM from one of the CSE-related schools (formerly, one of the 7 related departments):TUM School of Computation, Information, and Technology (CIT): comprising the former departments of Informatics (IN), Mathematics (MA), and Electrical and Computer Engineering (EI)TUM School of Engineering and Design (ED): comprising the former departments of Mechanical Engineering (MW), and Civil, Geo and Environmental Engineering (BGU), andTUM School of Natural Sciences (NAT): comprising the former departments of Physics (PH) and Chemistry (CH).They will process your registration form and grade your thesis. In such a setting, often an external person acts as an assistant advisor/supervisor.\nThe CSE program coordinators often receive thesis offers from institutes at universities, various companies, or former CSE students. External offers for theses are usually sent by email, and/or posted at the bulletin board in front of the chair.\nEach thesis must be examined by one (or two) professor(s) (with “Prof.” or “PD” in their title), at least one of whom must be a faculty member at TUM. If you wish to complete your thesis at an external company, please make sure to find suitable examiners in time. Past students have experienced that it can be difficult to find professors willing to act as examiners for the master's thesis if they did not propose the topic.\nThe master's thesis should be written in English. The Examination Board may accept another language (specifically, German), but a summary in English must be included in that case. The summary should not exceed one page (15–20 lines are sufficient).\nNeed help writing in English? The English Writing Center offers free one-on-one English writing consultation to all members of the TUM community. This is a great offer that can improve the quality of your final thesis. Take a look at their website and feel free to book an appointment!\nFor a general overview of all formalities regarding the master's thesis, refer to this information. In particular, note that you must be enrolled throughout the working time of the thesis, up to the moment you submit (see thesis).\nThe aforementioned portal also includes a collection of tips and tricks regarding theses.\nThesis Registration\nThesis registration defines the topic and the intended start date, and should be submitted as soon as the topic and schedule are decided: This helps narrow the content of the project and sets a deadline for submission. We highly recommend that you submit an abstract of the thesis before officially registering for a topic, in order to ensure that the topic is appropriate for CSE. This is especially important if the thesis will be written at an external university, a company, or a non-CSE chair at TUM. Only topics that are related to CSE will be accepted!\nAs of the 15th of January 2024, theses are handled via the Koinon-School Portal to unify and digitize processes at the School of CIT, as well as ensuring that all involved parties are properly informed of any updates in the status of the thesis from registration through submission and final grading.\nFor consistency, we use the terms Supervisor (Betreuer in German) -- sometimes formerly referred to as advisor, and Examiner (Prüfer in German), corresponding to the evaluating Prof. or PD -- sometimes formerly referred to as supervisor.\nTo register for your master's thesis, your supervisor will need to enter your registration on the portal up to two weeks before the official starting date at the earliest (and max. two weeks after start at the latest). You will then be informed via email about the entry, which you have to confirm is correct. This includes theses examined by professors in other departments.\nIf there are issues with this workflow, please contact us and send your thesis proposal to the Examination Board (via email or in person to the secretary of the CSE examination board) using this registration form. (If you have two TUM examiners, please use this form instead.) The form ensures that the Examiner(s) agree(s) with supervising the thesis, as we will have to register you manually (in place of the supervisor).\nSubmitting your Master's Thesis\nSubmission Deadline\nThe master's thesis must be submitted no later than six months after the start date.\nNote: Please make sure in advance that the chosen topic can be handled within the required timeframe. This is especially important if you plan to write your thesis at another university or an external institution, as they may be used to having more time to complete a thesis project.\nSubmission Requirements\nThe use of a proper typesetting system like LaTeX is strongly recommended. Please refer to the thesis guidelines and rules for form and delivery while you are working on the thesis. Since these thesis guidelines hold for theses of the Depts. of CS and CE programs, make sure you adapt them for CSE. Most importantly, ensure that all relevant information appears in the title pages, and make sure to include the signed Declaration of Own Work. \nAn unofficial template that fulfills all formal requirements for CSE can be found here (provided by Walter Simson). Feel free to use templates from other departments (particularly if writing a thesis with them), but make sure to adopt changes to conform to the CSE requirements!\nSubmission will now take place digitally via the Koinon-Portal. The deadline includes the specified day: i.e., deadline applies at 23:59 CE(S)T. Most importantly, make sure to indicate when your submission is final!\nThesis Grading\nAfter you submit your thesis, the Examiner(s) will receive a grading request. The examiner(s) usually need a few weeks for reviewing and grading. When having more than one examiner, the thesis grade is calculated by averaging the value of the two grades given by the examiners.\nThesis Presentation\nCSE regulations before Winter Semester 2024/25 do not require thesis presentations, but some examiners choose to make them mandatory. Students starting from Winter Semester 2024/25 do have a mandatory presentation. If you are required to present your thesis, the examiner(s) will determine the presentation format, and you will be responsible for finding a date and room for the presentation. You are welcome to use the SCCS Colloquium for this purpose.\nPlease note: The submission date of your thesis is the official last date of your thesis work. Even if your presentation takes place after this date, the submission date will still be used for official purposes.\nExtension of deadline\nIf you are unable to meet the submission deadline for any reason outside your control (i.e. access to resources/facilities, software/hardware failure, medical conditions, ...), you can request an extension adding appropriate documentation supporting your issues on the Koinon-Portal as well. Your examiner will be able to add a comment as well to confirm agreement with extensions for reasons other than health-related requests.\nPlease note that requesting additional time to improve results or polishing the work is not a valid reason for extension! Results deviating from expectations are, up to a point, also something which should be considered during topic definition, and therefore usually not a valid reason for extending the working time.\nIn general, if you are ill and prevented from working on the thesis, the working period will be paused according to the received medical certification. Please refer to the following link describing what the medical note must include in order to be considered valid.\nPlease send any extension request as soon as issues arise, and at least one week before the deadline, so that the extension can be processed in a timely manner. In addition, you should check, well in advance of the submission deadline, whether any circumstances that demand an extension have occurred.\nThesis\nPlease be aware that CSE has its own examination board and, as such, some regulations differ from other Informatics' Programs.

      "content": "[HEADING] Master's Degree Programs at TUM\nTUM offers over 100 master’s degree programs from a variety of fields. Find out here what master’s programs there are and how to apply.\nMaster’s degree programs are graduate studies. That means, you have to complete an undergraduate degree to qualify, for example a bachelor’s degree program.\nDepending on the program, TUM awards the following master’s degrees: Master of Science (M.Sc.), Master of Arts (M.A.), Master of Business Administration (MBA), Master of Education (M.Ed.) and Master of Science with honors (M.Sc. with honors). As a rule, students with master's degrees are entitled to pursue a doctorate.\nIf you have completed your studies outside of Germany and would now like to know what options you have with your degree with respect to master's degree programs in germany, the anabin-database can provide orientation.\nA master's program can build on an undergraduate degree or it can be used to pursue a new field of study. In either case, these are referred to as consecutive master’s programs. Other master’s programs are particularly aimed at prospective students with professional experience. These are referred to as continuing education master’s programs. Contact the Student Advisory Office to learn how the TUM bachelor's programs align with the TUM master's programs or visit Master’s Day, which takes place annually.\nView Master's Degree Programs at TUM\nConsecutive master’s programs are often structured on a bachelor's program of the same name. They are designed to deepen and expand the knowledge acquired during the undergraduate program. TUM offers at least one consecutive master's program for each bachelor's program.\nSome master's programs are not structured on the basis of specific bachelor's programs. Instead, they can be pursued by students who hold bachelor's degrees from a range of different fields. While these programs require certain fundamental knowledge, this can be acquired through various bachelor's programs.  Example: TUM graduates with a Bachelor's in mechanical engineering can apply for a Master's in aerospace, mechanical engineering or robotics, cognition, intelligence, to name a few.\nAs a rule, continuing education master’s programs require candidates to have at least one year of work experience. In some cases, the programs may be attended while holding gainful employment. Duration of studies varies accordingly. Special tuition fees also apply.  Example: Students with a Bachelor's or undergraduate degree in electrical engineering and information technology have the option of pursuing continuing education master's programs like an Executive MBA.\nTUM also offers double degree programs. Double degree programs give you the opportunity to receive a degree from both TUM and one of its partner universities.\nHere you will find further information on double degree programs.\nMaster degree programs are subject to a two-step aptitude assessment procedure. Once an application has been received, the first step involves evaluating the application documents based on a point system.

You can find a detailed list of the documents you need to upload in your TUMonline account in your application status. If you are unsure about individual documents, please visit our glossary of documents.\nUsually, documents are considered authentic if they bear the signature and seal of the issuing official body (school management, exam management, etc.), alternatively a digital seal, a verification code, or a QR code for online verification.\nMachine-generated documents without a signature, seal, or digital seal/verification code are not sufficient.\nPlease always upload all pages of a document, including the back pages, if they contain information (seals, annotations, etc.).\nIt is not required to upload notarized copies of the documents for admission or enrollment. It is sufficient that the documents are authentic, i.e. bear the signature and seal of the issuing official body, alternatively a digital seal, a verification code, or a QR code for online verification.\nYou can therefore upload the originals of your diplomas and certificates, as long as they meet these requirements.\nImportant: For documents issued in China, Georgia or Iran please note the special rules explained below.\nAll documents that must be uploaded for application and enrollment must be in German or English. Documents that were originally issued in German or English do not need to be translated.\nDocuments issued in another language must be translated by a sworn translator and authenticated with an official seal.\nIf the document is in a language other than German or English, please upload the authentic document in the original language and the translation by a sworn translator as a joint PDF.\nFor documents to be verified, they must contain a verification code or PIN and a link to the verification website. This must be an official website of the issuing institution that can be accessed in German or English.\nThe entire content of the document must be verifiable online on the website.\nPlease check in advance that the verification website works and that the entire content of the document is reproduced. It is not sufficient if, for example, only a confirmation of the date of issue is displayed.\nFor some documents, you must contact the responsible institution (the test provider, the university, etc.) to have TUM approved for verification.\nIf digital verification does not work, the document must be uploaded with a signature and seal from the issuing institution.\nA digital seal is an electronic proof of the authenticity of a document affixed by the issuing authority or institution.\nThe digital seal must be verifiable online and clearly identify the issuing authority. The information on the seal must be available online in German or English.\nIf the digital seal cannot be verified, the document must be uploaded with a signature and seal of the issuing institution.\nPlease note: Digital seals are often linked to the PDF file and become invalid if the file is changed. Please upload the PDF file unchanged.\nIf you are unable to upload authentic documents required for admission or enrollment by the deadline, your application cannot be considered and must be rejected for the semester in question for formal reasons.\nIf we have any doubts about the authenticity of your documents, you will be asked by e-mail to come to the Service Desk of the Admissions and Enrollment department in person and present the original documents. Please do not come to the Service Desk unless you are asked to do so by e-mail.\nPlease note: In this case, the documents must be submitted in person; it is not possible to send them by post.

On this page you'll find everything you need to know when it comes to proving your language skills.\nCourses at TUM are offered in two languages of instruction: German and English. There are degree programs in which all courses are offered either entirely in German or in English. In some degree programs, you can or must take courses or modules in both German and English. Depending on the degree program and the focus of your studies, you will therefore need different language skills.\nThe options listed here are sufficient to comply with the minimum language requirements needed for admission. Depending on the program and your individual background it may, however, be necessary for you to keep working on your language skills during your studies. Be sure to check out the services of our Language Center.\nFor information on what credentials you need to provide when applying for a specific degree program, please see our degree program pages.\nNot sure what to use as proof of your language skills when applying? Our Language Skill Navigator can help you narrow down your options.\nGood command of German is an important prerequisite to successfully complete your studies at TUM. Proof of sufficient German language skills must be submitted before the end of the application period for all degree programs whose language of instruction is German.\nApplicants holding a German university entrance qualification do not require verification of their German language skills. German citizens with an international higher education entrance qualification who have spent at least two school years at a German-speaking school may submit two annual school certificates of this school as proof of their German language proficiency.\nPlease also note the information on the requirements of the Standing Conference of the Ministers of Education in Germany (KMK) regarding proof of German language proficiency. A list of certificates recognized as proof of German language proficiency can be found in the KMK’s framework regulations (pdf, German, 391 KB).\nMore information for exchange students is available at TUM Global & Alumni Office.\nApplicants who have not obtained their higher education entrance qualification at a German-speaking institution are required to have sufficient German language skills to be able to complete their studies at a German university (linguistic study ability).\nWhen applying for degree programs requiring proof of sufficient German skills for admission, you may submit the following certificates:\nA DSH passed with an overall result of at least DSH-2 is considered proof of linguistic study ability for admission or enrollment to all degree programs and degrees.\nOnly for the bachelor degree programs Aerospace and Information Engineering also DSH-1 (or higher).\nThe German language diploma of the Permanent Conference of the Ministers for Education and Cultural Affairs – Second Level (= DSD II): It is sufficient to have reached Level B 2 in all four sections.\nOnly for the bachelor degree programs Aerospace and Information Engineering also DSD I (or higher).\nPassed the telc Deutsch C1 Hochschule.\nOnly for the bachelor degree programs Aerospace and Information Engineering also telc Deutsch A2 (or higher).\nTest of German as a foreign language for foreign students (TestDaF) with a result that demonstrates having reached level 4 in all sections.\nOnly for the bachelor degree programs Aerospace and Information Engineering also level 3 in all sections (or higher).\nPassed a Goethe Certificate C2.\nOnly for the bachelor degree programs Aerospace and Information Engineering also Goethe Certificate A2 (or higher).\nPassed Österreichisches Sprachdiplom C2.\nOnly for the bachelor degree programs Aerospace and Information Engineering also ÖSD Certificate A2 (or higher).\nPlease note that the certificates mentioned here only meet the formal minimum requirements. To study successfully, we strongly recommend that you expand and deepen your language skills during your studies.\nIn some cases, an alternative form of proof of language proficiency may be submitted in place of a language certificate. Please refer to the Academic and Examination Regulations of your degree program (FPSO) for specific details.\nCertificate of an aptitude test that proves the ability of foreign applicants to take up higher education studies in Germany (qualification assessment examination).\nA certificate from a European School is accepted as proof of German language proficiency only with a successful completion of an examination in German as a first language (L1) or second language (L2).\nA diploma from a German-language educational institution in Germany or abroad.\nPlease note: If you wish to submit a diploma/degree certificate of an academic degree (e.g. a bachelor's with German as language of instruction) as proof of your language skills, you need to submit this document to the online application form.

in the winter semester of 2024/25.\nOn this page, you can find out who these tuition fees apply to and how TUM uses them to improve studying and teaching for all students.\nFrom the winter semester 2024/25, tuition fees for international students from third countries will only be charged for newly enrolled students in Bachelor's and Master's degree programs.\nAs a leading international university, the Technical University of Munich is committed to offering our talented students the best possible conditions to develop their skills and personalities. Every year, more and more young people from all over the world place their trust in the opportunities that TUM offers them for their future. We want to continue to live up to this trust and give our students access to outstanding education and training.\nTo achieve this, it is essential to offer not only outstanding personalities in research and teaching, but also the highest standards of infrastructure, equipment, study areas, management, and support for our students. Within Germany and the EU, there are mechanisms and agreements in place that allow the financing of studies from public funds. In order to enable international students from third countries who are not part of this education system to study at TUM, we charge fees for international students from third countries. These fees benefit all students by ensuring sustainable and excellent study and learning conditions.\nAll international students from third countries must pay tuition fees from winter semester 2024/25 if they enroll in a new degree program at TUM.\nThe following groups are exempt from tuition fees:\nFamily members of EU citizens with the right of permanent residence\nPersons with an established domestic connection, regardless of their citizenship. Established domestic connection means\nYou have lived in Germany for a total of at least 5 years before starting your studies and were regularly employed or\nat least one parent has been in Germany for a total of at least 3 years during the last 6 years and was regularly employed.\nStudents with disabilities\nForeign nationals with a residence permit\nStudents seeking asylum who are nationals of a country with a special protection quota can have their tuition fees for international students from third countries waived on application. Further information can be found on the site on scholarships and waivers.  \tPlease note: Persons entitled to asylum and recognized refugees are not automatically exempt from the obligation to pay tuition fees based on this status. However, if they are not exempt from the obligation to pay fees due to an established domestic connection, you can apply for a waiver due to social reaseons, which will be considered favorably. Further information can be found on the site on scholarships and waivers.\nStudents in the following programs are also exempt from tuition fees:\nPlease note: Different regulations continue to apply for executive degree programs.\nThere are opportunities for particularly high-achieving or needy students to receive a scholarship or apply for a waiver of fees.\nTo get an initial assessment of whether you are subject to tuition fees, you can use the tuition compass.\nThe tuition fees usually amount to\nYou can find a list with the fees for each program here.\nIf you are enrolled in two degree programs at the same time (parallel studies), tuition fees apply for both programs.\nIrrespective of the tuition fees, the semester fees must also be paid.\nThe tuition fees for international students from third countries will be charged from winter semester 2024/25 for new enrollment in a degree program at TUM.\nAll students who are already enrolled in a degree program at TUM before winter semester 2024/25 do not have to pay tuition fees for their further studies in this degree program.\nThe payment deadline for first-time enrollment for the summer semester is March 15, for the winter semester September 15.\nThe payment deadline for re-enrollment for the summer semester is February 15, for the winter semester August 15.\nYour transfer will appear in your TUMonline contribution account within approximately 5 business days. Your enrollment will not take place until payment has been received.\nThe total amount to be transferred is displayed in your TUMonline account, i.e. the sum of the semester fee and the tuition fees. Please pay this total amount in a single transfer to the following bank account:\nPayment recipient:\nFor payments from outside the SEPA area, please check with your bank if bank charges apply. Please indicate that all bank charges are to be paid by the remitter, including charges from intermediary institutions.  To do this, please inform your bank to select ‘OUR’ for the details of charges.\nPlease note: Payment in installments is not possible.\nInternational students who are subject to tuition fees are exempt from paying tuition fees during their leave of absence semester. The exemption is granted with the approval of the leave of absence.\nPlease apply for a leave of absence for the following semester as early as possible, i.e. by August 15 for the winter semester and by February 15 for the summer semester.\nAs soon as the leave of absence is approved, only the semester fee will be shown as outstanding in TUMonline and you can transfer it.\nHere you can find all information on applying for a leave of absence.\nIf you disenroll within five weeks of the start of lectures, tuition fees already paid will be refunded. If you disenroll later, a refund is unfortunately not possible.\nIf you have already paid the tuition fees and then get awarded a waiver scholarship, the tuition fee will be reimbursed for the semester in which the waiver scholarship becomes effective.\nIf you have completed a Bachelor’s degree at a German university, you are generally not required to pay tuition fees for international students from third countries for a Master’s degree.

      "content": "Admission to degree programs at TUM is handled in several different ways. This page provides an overview of the admission procedures.\nBe sure to inform yourself about the details of the procedure for a specific program in the academic and examination regulations or the regulations on the aptitude assessment or aptitude recommendation.\nApplicants will be granted admission to a program with unrestricted admission when\nCertain programs require that an internship be completed before the start of studies. When applying for a Master's program, the applicant's Bachelor's degree will be checked to confirm that it is accredited. This is especially true if the applicant is transferring from another university.\nUnrestricted degree programs\nFirst, the applicant’s grade point average and subject-specific grades will be evaluated using a point system. Which grades are evaluated and how they are weighted depends on the applicant’s chosen degree program. Each program has a set of statutes that define the formula to be used. Depending on the degree program and the amount of points accumulated, applicants are either immediately admitted or invited to an admissions interview or written test carried out by the school. The interview or test helps determine if the applicant is capable of successfully completing the desired degree program. For certain programs, the interview or written test is also intended to determine whether the necessary language requirements are met. For some programs, applicants below a certain point threshold may be rejected without an interview or written test.\nPlease note: In contrast to the Numerus Clausus programs, the number of spots available (capacity limit) is not fixed. We accept all applicants we feel are qualified. As such, no lotteries will be held after final selections have been made, and there will be no list of alternatives for unsuccessful applicants to claim unwanted spots.\nDegree programs subject to aptitude assessment\nOur Aptitude recommendation supports students in choosing the degree program best suited to their interests and abilities.\nFirst, the applicant’s grade point average and subject-specific grades will be evaluated using a point system. Which grades are evaluated and how they are weighted depends on the applicant’s chosen degree program. Each program has a set of statues that defines the formula to be used. Depending on the amount of points accumulated, applicants are either immediately admitted or invited to a  mandatory, 20 minute interview carried out by the school. The interview helps determine if the applicant is capable of successfully completing the desired course of study. There is no written test.\nThe result of the interview determines whether the applicant receives a recommendation for the degree program. The purpose of the recommendation is to help students select the right program – it is, however, no mandatory requirement for admission.\nNC degree programs have a fixed number of spots available, awarded primarily based on the applicant's grade point average and the amount of time the student has been waiting for a spot. This amount of time is defined as the number of semesters that have elapsed since completion of secondary studies and in which the applicant has not been admitted to a German university. Periods in which the applicant audited classes or studied abroad also count as waiting time. Applicants who are not admitted are automatically put on an alternatives list. These students may be admitted at a later date in the event a spot is not accepted by another student.\nNC program eligibility will be based solely on the results of the past years. The grade point average of the last person to have been admitted constitutes the current NC standard. Since the number of applicants and their criteria (grades, waiting time, etc.) are unpredictable, it is still possible to apply with a lower grade point average than the current NC grades.\nDegree programs with restricted admission\nPlease note: The application and admission for NC programs is coordinated via the dialogue-oriented service procedure.\nIn the initial stage of this procedure, the grades you obtained during your Bachelor’s program, as well as your written documents, will be evaluated using a point system.\nFor some degree programs, the first stage of the aptitude assessment differs for applicants who have obtained their Bachelor’s degree in a country outside the scope of the “Lisbon Convention”: They have to take an online test. You can find out whether this applies to your desired degree program on the respective program page in the section “How do I apply?”.\nDepending on the number of points accumulated, applicants are either immediately admitted, rejected, or invited to a 20 minute admissions interview carried out by the school. In some cases interviews by telephone or video for international students are common. The interview helps determine if the applicant is capable of successfully completing the desired course of study. For some programs offered by the TUM School of Engineering and Design and the TUM School of Management a written test or the assessment of your academic qualification and your essay replace the interview.\nLecture period, lecture-free days, or enrollment periods – all semester dates and deadlines at a glance.\n+49 89 289 22245  Monday to Friday, 9:00 a.m. – 12:00 p.m.   studiumspam prevention@tum.de Please observe the e-mail etiquette.\nFind all the info on our services here.\nPersonal advising sessions with General Student Advising by appointment.\nCampus Munich, Arcisstraße 21, Room 0144, 80333 München\nMonday, Wednesday, Friday: 9 a.m. – 12 p.m.\nTuesday and Thursday, 1 p.m. – 4 p.m. (Student Information only)\n• Show convenient version of this site\n• Don't show this message again\n• Unrestricted degree programs\n• Aptitude assessment for Bachelor’s degree programs\n• Aptitude recommendation (SOV) for Bachelor’s degree applicants\n• Restricted degree programs (Numerus Clausus, NC)\n• Aptitude assessment for Master’s degree applicants\n• the online application was submitted in time and complete with all required documents,\n• and your documents have been reviewed.\n[CARD]\nDates and Deadlines\nDates and Deadlines\n\n\nLecture period, lecture-free days, or enrollment periods – all semester dates and deadlines at a glance.\n[CARD]\nDates and Deadlines\nDates and Deadlines\n[CARD]\nDates and Deadlines\n[CARD]\nLecture period, lecture-free days, or enrollment periods – all semester dates and deadlines at a glance.\n[CARD]\nStudent Advising and Information Services\nStudent Advising and Information Services\n\n\n +49 89 289 22245  Monday to Friday, 9:00 a.m. – 12:00 p.m.   studiumspam prevention@tum.de Please observe the e-mail etiquette.\nFind all the info on our services here.\nPersonal advising sessions with General Student Advising by appointment.\n[CARD]\nStudent Advising and Information Services\nStudent Advising and Information Services\n[CARD]\nStudent Advising and Information Services\n[CARD]\n+49 89 289 22245  Monday to Friday, 9:00 a.m. – 12:00 p.m.   studiumspam prevention@tum.de Please observe the e-mail etiquette.\nFind all the info on our services here.\nPersonal advising sessions with General Student Advising by appointment.\n[CARD]\nService Desk\nService Desk\n\n\n Campus Munich, Arcisstraße 21, Room 0144, 80333 München\nMonday, Wednesday, Friday: 9 a.m. – 12 p.m.\nTuesday and Thursday, 1 p.m. – 4 p.m. (Student Information only)\n[CARD]\nService Desk\nService Desk\n[CARD]\nService Desk\n[CARD]\nCampus Munich, Arcisstraße 21, Room 0144, 80333 München\nMonday, Wednesday, Friday: 9 a.m. – 12 p.m.\nTuesday and Thursday, 1 p.m. – 4 p.m. (Student Information only)",
