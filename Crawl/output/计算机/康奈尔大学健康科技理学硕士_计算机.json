Established jointly by Cornell University and the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, our mission is to transform key industries through technological innovation, deep-tech startups, and uniquely skilled talent.\nCornell Tech and the Jacobs Technion-Cornell Institute stand with our Technion colleagues and their families in these difficult times.\nOur faculty and students are unafraid to break with convention. We support experimentation in flexible, cross-disciplinary hubs instead of traditional academic departments.\nInterdisciplinary, domain-focused programs equip students to transform industries where technology’s impact is most positively felt.\nThrough programs that tackle application domains in depth, our students and postdocs enter the workforce with expanded opportunities to lead teams and start companies in fast-growing industries.\nBy bringing together two world-class institutions, we dramatically expand the scope of international collaborations between top-notch students and faculty.\nThis first-of-its-kind degree, developed with input from Twitter, Facebook, Google, and The New York Times, educates a new generation to realize the full utility of connective media and constantly innovate new ways to develop and interact with it. By building new technologies to connect people, students explore the social theory behind their technology and learn to ask questions of it.\nIn this pioneering degree program, students build the digital health technologies that will transform healthcare. In addition to gaining unparalleled industry insight, students learn to apply machine learning, data science, and other emerging tools to change the way healthcare is delivered and experienced.\nIn our newest two-year program, you will acquire two world-class tech credentials as you find ways to make cities smarter, more sustainable, and more livable. In addition, your living laboratory will be New York City—the ultimate urban ecosystem and the perfect place to build unparalleled connections.\nRunway ushers recent PhDs in digital technology fields through a paradigm shift: from an academic mindset to an entrepreneurial outlook. With an impressive package that includes a salary, research budget, housing allowance, space and more, postdocs get a bit of “runway” to launch their startup companies.\nThe Urban Tech Hub of the Jacobs Technion-Cornell Institute at Cornell Tech is a new venture in New York City that generates applied research, fosters an expanding tech ecosystem, and cultivates the next generation of leaders in urban technology.\nThe Ruch Collaboration Grants incentivize faculty at Cornell and the Technion to collaborate on proposals to the National Science Foundation, the US-Israel Binational Foundation, and other agencies.\nThe Ruch Faculty Exchange Program increases faculty collaboration between the Cornell campuses and the Technion by funding travel for joint research projects and workshops that span both campuses.\nTechnion students can apply for funding to live in New York City and work hands-on with Cornell Tech faculty. The program connects Jacobs Institute faculty seeking short-term research assistance with talented students from the Technion.\nThis 10-day academic and cultural trip offers students an opportunity to learn about the growing economy of innovation in Israel. Coursework focuses on Israel’s established startup ecosystem, as well as development for real-time application in a design-led workshop.\nThe Jacobs Institute encourages Technion faculty to spend sabbatical time on the Cornell Tech campus collaborating with Cornell Tech-based faculty.

While each program has a different subject matter focus, all provide a strong technical foundation, which in conjunction with the Studio curriculum, equips Cornell Tech’s graduates to pursue a variety of engineering and analytical roles, many at the junction of technology and business. Overall, Cornell Tech’s technical program graduates who sought full-time employment achieved an 89% employment rate within three months of graduation.\nProspective students should note that past employment rates are not indicative or predictive of future outcomes.\nNote: n- indicates the total number of technical program graduates each year; Other paths — graduates returning to their pre-program employer, pursuing fellowships and/or other personal, non-degree related interests, continuing their education (e.g., medical school or PhD), or international students returning to their home country.\nThe majority of Technical programs graduates accepted roles such as software developer, data scientist, data analyst, or data engineer. Examples of companies that hired students in 2024 included Amazon, Bloomberg, Bytedance, Google, Intuit, Microsoft, Oracle, TikTok, Verizon, and others.\nThe total compensation at tech companies, where the majority of technical programs graduates accepted roles, depends on the stage of the company’s life cycle, the amount of equity granted (and its value) as well as years and relevance of professional experiences of a graduate. In 2024, the median salary was $135,000. In most cases, in addition to salary offers included equity, sign-on, year-end, or performance bonuses and relocation allowance (where applicable).\nMaster of Engineering in Computer Science\nMaster of Engineering in Operations Research and Information Engineering\nMaster of Engineering in Electrical and Computer Engineering\nJacobs Technion-Cornell Dual MS Degrees – Connective Media Concentration\nJacobs Technion-Cornell Dual MS Degrees – Health Tech Concentration\nJacobs Technion-Cornell Dual MS Degrees – Urban Tech Concentration\nNote: n- indicates the total number of technical program graduates each year; Other paths — graduates returning to their pre-program employer, pursuing fellowships and/or other personal, non-degree related interests, continuing their education (e.g., medical school or PhD), or international students returning to their home country. Percentages may not add up to 100% due to rounding.\nMost of the students in the two-year programs take advantage of summer internships between their first and second years.\nCompanies that hired Jacobs students for summer internships in 2024 included Amazon, Google, Geico, Genentech, Memorial Sloan Kettering, TikTok, Weill Cornell Medicine, and others. The majority of the internship roles were in the areas of software development and data analysis.\nThe Johnson Cornell Tech MBA is a STEM-designated degree for OPT applications by international students. In 2024, 73% of the graduates sought full-time employment and 8% started their own businesses.\nNote: n- indicates the total number of Johnson Cornell Tech MBA graduates each year; Other paths — graduates returning to their pre-MBA employer, pursuing fellowships and/or other personal, non-degree related interests or continuing their education (e.g., medical school or PhD).\nConsistent with the prior years, the majority of accepted jobs in the class of 2024 were with mature companies or startups, mainly in the technology sector. Examples of 2024 employers include Amazon, BCG, C3.ai, NBC Universal, SAP, and Walmart.\nNote: Percentages may not add up to 100% due to rounding.\nNote: The above numbers include all graduates in each cohort regardless of their post-graduation paths.\nThe median base salary for 2024 graduates seeking jobs (73% of the class) was $152,000. As most students accepted jobs with tech companies, a significant portion of the annual compensation is represented by equity, the value of which compresses salary relative to offers with no equity component.\nEach year, the Cornell Tech LLM carefully selects a small group of lawyers dedicated to meeting the needs of tech and tech-dependent industries in a business-focused and holistic fashion. At nine months past graduation, over 94% of reporting graduates from all years who sought employment were employed. 95% of our Class of 2024 are employed or continuing their education five months after graduation.\nCornell Tech graduates have accepted offers from large law firms like Orrick, Paul Weiss, Ropes & Gray, White & Case, Greenberg Traurig, Gibson Dunn & Crutcher, and Sullivan & Cromwell, as well as smaller innovative firms that serve the startup community like Farrell Fritz, J&O Law, Brand Counsel, and Renno & Co. Those choosing to practice law in-house have joined established companies like McKinsey, Sotheby’s, Travelers, LG, X, IBM, AECOM, and Meta as well as emerging companies like Akoya, Traackr, Bryter, Paxos, UiPath, and DailyPay. Our graduates are also impacting the startup economy worldwide through work at The World Bank and the International Finance Corporation. Some of our graduates are teaching and pursuing graduate degrees in law programs around the world, and others are informing policy as fellows with foundations like NewAmerica. We even have alumni working in government to establish their nations as tech leaders.\nShould you have an interest in learning more about the paths taken by our graduates, please contact Cornell Tech Admissions at admissions@tech.cornell.edu and we will connect you with someone who can share more information.\n• Career Outcomes\n• For Current and Prospective Students\n• For Employers\n• Master of Engineering in Computer Science\n• Master of Engineering in Electrical and Computer Engineering\n• Master of Engineering in Operations Research and Information Engineering\n• Jacobs Technion-Cornell Dual MS Degrees – Connective Media Concentration\n• Jacobs Technion-Cornell Dual MS Degrees – Health Tech Concentration\n• Jacobs Technion-Cornell Dual MS Degrees – Urban Tech Concentration\n• Johnson Cornell Tech MBA\n• Master of Laws (LLM) in Law, Technology, and Entrepreneurship\n[GRID_TABLE]\nCareer Outcomes\nCareer Outcomes\nFor Current and Prospective Students\nFor Current and Prospective Students\nFor Employers\nFor Employers\n[CARD]\nLearn more about Technical programs:\nLearn more about Technical programs:\n\nMaster of Engineering in Computer Science\nMaster of Engineering in Electrical and Computer Engineering\nMaster of Engineering in Operations Research and Information Engineering\nJacobs Technion-Cornell Dual MS Degrees – Connective Media Concentration\nJacobs Technion-Cornell Dual MS Degrees – Health Tech Concentration\nJacobs Technion-Cornell Dual MS Degrees – Urban Tech Concentration\n[CARD]\nLearn more about Technical programs:\n[CARD]\nMaster of Engineering in Computer Science\nMaster of Engineering in Electrical and Computer Engineering\nMaster of Engineering in Operations Research and Information Engineering\nJacobs Technion-Cornell Dual MS Degrees – Connective Media Concentration\nJacobs Technion-Cornell Dual MS Degrees – Health Tech Concentration\nJacobs Technion-Cornell Dual MS Degrees – Urban Tech Concentration\n[CARD]\n2024 Career Outcomes by Program\n2024 Career Outcomes by Program\nMaster of Engineering in Computer Science\n[CARD]\n2024 Career Outcomes by Program\n[CARD]\nMaster of Engineering in Computer Science\n[CARD]\n2024 Career Outcomes by Program\n2024 Career Outcomes by Program\nMaster of Engineering in Operations Research and Information Engineering\n[CARD]\nMaster of Engineering in Operations Research and Information Engineering\n[CARD]\n2024 Career Outcomes by Program\n2024 Career Outcomes by Program\nMaster of Engineering in Electrical and Computer Engineering\n[CARD]\nMaster of Engineering in Electrical and Computer Engineering\n[CARD]\n2024 Career Outcomes by Program\n2024 Career Outcomes by Program\nJacobs Technion-Cornell Dual MS Degrees – Connective Media Concentration\n[CARD]\nJacobs Technion-Cornell Dual MS Degrees – Connective Media Concentration\n[CARD]\n2024 Career Outcomes by Program\n2024 Career Outcomes by Program\nJacobs Technion-Cornell Dual MS Degrees – Health Tech Concentration\n[CARD]\nJacobs Technion-Cornell Dual MS Degrees – Health Tech Concentration\n[CARD]\n2024 Career Outcomes by Program\n2024 Career Outcomes by Program\nJacobs Technion-Cornell Dual MS Degrees – Urban Tech Concentration\n[CARD]\nJacobs Technion-Cornell Dual MS Degrees – Urban Tech Concentration\n[CARD]\nLearn more about the JCT MBA program:\nLearn more about the JCT MBA program:\n\nJohnson Cornell Tech MBA\n[CARD]\nLearn more about the JCT MBA program:\n[CARD]\nJohnson Cornell Tech MBA\n[CARD]\nLearn more about the LLM program:\nLearn more about the LLM program:\n\nMaster of Laws (LLM) in Law, Technology, and Entrepreneurship\n[CARD]\nLearn more about the LLM program:\n[CARD]\nMaster of Laws (LLM) in Law, Technology, and Entrepreneurship",

We often hear students say that working with their team was the most rewarding, life-changing part of their Cornell Tech experience.\nDownload Transcript\nDevelop a new tech solution to answer a challenge posed by organizations like Amazon, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and the New York Times. Then, choose whether you want to develop your own startup and pitch it to investors or develop a new tech product with a major company like Samsung, Mastercard or E*Trade. Whichever track you choose, you can also round out your focus with a wide selection of Studio electives.\nOur faculty and practitioners include professors, patent-holders, former executives, founders, venture capitalists, and all types of visiting practitioners from New York City’s technology community.  Thanks to the convening power of a university like Cornell, experts are eager to come to campus to advise and critique our students’ work in the Studio.\nThe Cornell Tech Studio experience isn’t a simulation of the product development process; it is the development process. It puts you in dialogue with some of the industry’s foremost thought leaders and prepares you to hit the ground running with real product management experience.\nThe Studio culture encourages sharing, critiquing and celebrating innovative ideas. Events like Open Studio, Studio Sprints, and Student-Led Scrums foster creativity, teamwork, and close interaction with leaders from New York City’s technology and startup communities.\nOur programs are driven by the project-based, cross-functional collaborations that define how the most innovative ideas and successful companies are brought into being.\n• Studio Curriculum

Students are responsible for paying all fees for such evaluations and making arrangements with the credential evaluation company to send and receive their documents. Applicants who attended a foreign institution that has an affiliation with a U.S. Based institution are exempt from this. NYU Shanghai and Abu Dhabi are two examples of institutions that fit this criteria.\n• Transcripts: International applicants must provide a certified English translation of transcripts if the original language is not English. Successful international applicants will have received a baccalaureate degree from a college or university of recognized standing.

      "content": "[HEADING] FAQs\n[HEADING] What differentiates Runway?\n[HEADING] Applying to Runway\n[HEADING] Investment, Equity and Intellectual Property Rights\n[HEADING] International Applicants\nWhat is the difference between Runway and the typical accelerator or incubator?\nThe Runway Postdoc Program accepts Ph. D.s with deep technological expertise. It transitions them from academia to the business world by providing classes and workshops on entrepreneurship, mentors, financial support, and time. While other programs immediately groom their startups for investment and often conclude after several months, Runway lasts a year, with a possible one-year extension. We don’t expect our Startup Postdocs to arrive with already-incorporated companies or employees, although that’s not a problem.\nHoused within the Jacobs Technion-Cornell Institute at Cornell Tech, the program is a unique nexus of three university campuses: Cornell Tech, Cornell University, and Technion–Israel Institute of Technology, a global leader in startup innovation. It taps resources from all three campuses.\nRunway capitalizes on Cornell’s longstanding roots in New York City: a 50,000-person alumni network, the Weill Cornell Medical College, and numerous other universities are located here.\nAnd thanks to our location in the business capital of the world, Startup Postdocs team up with top-notch business mentors.\nWhat are the program's benefits and perks?\nAll Startup Postdocs receive a salary, research grant, housing allowance, workspace on campus, use of IP registration, and many other benefits found here.\nIs housing provided?\nNo, housing is not provided.\nWhat happens at Runway? What’s a typical day like?\nThere are no “typical” days. You’ll have some scheduled classes and events, but for the most part, you’ll be building your startup. Some days, you’ll work on campus, doing consumer and market research or developing your product. Other days, you’ll meet your mentors, consultants, or potential customers to assess your product market fit. Or you’ll sort through resumes and interview potential employees.\nHow can I ensure my startup is progressing at a decent pace?\nNo worries — we’ve established a schedule of goals to keep you organized. The first 3 months are dedicated to entrepreneurship and business training. We will work with you on your pitch and business plan, and you will get a chance to present it to investors and get feedback. In the following months, we will keep an ongoing mentorship and support you with Scrum meetings and individual advice and assistance, as well as introductions and office hours with Investors and Mentors from the NYC ecosystem.\nWhat if I’m still “taxiing” down the “Runway” after a year? If I need more time to launch my business, can I apply for an extension at Runway?\nYes, we grant one-year extensions to Startup Postdocs who have proven their entrepreneurial prowess. We consider extensions for those who have started to form a team, gathered initial investor traction and identified a strong market for their businesses, but perhaps require more time for product development, discovering clients, or strengthening a team. The Runway leadership team and external advisors ultimately decide who gets to stay.\nWhat are you looking for in an ideal candidate?\nMy idea is not directly related to my PhD thesis. Is that OK?\nYes, as long as you apply the knowledge of deep technology you mastered in graduate school.\nCan I apply for Runway if I’ve established my startup and it is already getting some traction?\nIf you need Runway’s educational and institutional support, you should still consider applying.\nAm I allowed to bring in co-founders or employees?\nYou are allowed to bring in team members — but the program’s benefits flow to you solely, the co-founder with the Ph.D.\nDo I need to move to New York City to join the program?\nYou can only reap the benefits of Runway, the Cornell Tech campus, and the rich local startup ecosystem if you’re living in New York City. Of course, we expect you’ll travel during the program to attend conferences and meet with customers, investors, vendors, etc.\nDo I need to submit a business plan with my application?\nNo, we evaluate our applications based on other criteria.\nWhen is the application deadline, and when are acceptances announced?\nApplication deadline is Feb 15, and accepted applicants are announced on April 15th. Found out more application information here.\nI'm visiting New York City. Can I come check out Runway?\nWe’re happy to host you on campus! Please let us know about your upcoming visit and if our team is available we’ll be happy to host you.\nCan I retain my right to my intellectual property if I join Runway?\nYes, you will get a royalty-free, exclusive, and perpetual license from the Jacobs Institute, essentially under the condition that you use your IP.\nHow much funding do Runway companies receive?\nPlease see our Benefits and Perks page.\nWhat is the financial model of Runway?\nUnlike many accelerators and incubators, Runway exists within a not-for-profit organization. Part of the Jacobs Technion-Cornell Institute’s mission is to devise new approaches to commercializing university technology and strategies for collaboration between companies and universities. That’s the role of Runway at the Jacobs Institute, and our Startup Postdocs are helping us fulfill it. At the moment, donations from generous supporters are funding the program.\nWhat control am I giving up by granting equity to the Jacobs Technion-Cornell Institute?\nNone. It is your business. We’re here to help you and your company succeed. Jacobs Technion-Cornell Institute will have equity shares in the company (typically around 8.5%), but no major decision-making provisions.\nHow can my business get funded after Runway ends?\nJacobs Technion-Cornell Institute and Cornell Tech faculty and staff will introduce you to angel investors, venture capitalists and other investors in New York City and beyond. We’ll also invite investors to the Cornell Tech campus several times during the program, including for Open Studio — our version of a demo day — to celebrate and present the current crop of startups across the Cornell Tech campus.\nDo I need to be a U.S. citizen to apply?\nNo. If you join Runway, expect a mini United Nations of PhD startups. We already have entrepreneurs from France, India, Israel, Brazil, Singapore, Netherlands, Iran, Canada, Lithuania, Germany, and of course, the United States.\nCan Runway get me a visa?\nThe Jacobs Technion-Cornell Institute will provide you with the forms to apply for a J-1, O1, or another appropriate visa for your duration in the Runway program.\nDo I need to incorporate my company in the U.S. to participate in Runway?\nYes, your company must be incorporated in the U.S. to be a credible partner for investors, customers, and employees and to protect your rights.\nCan you help my co-founder obtain a visa as well?\nOnly the Startup Postdoc is entitled to a visa. Your non-citizen founders or employees must be legally present in the U.S. to work for your company.\n• Master's Programs

To generate innovation and innovative leaders, we had to rethink graduate tech education itself. So our programs reflect the flexibility, technical depth and cross-fertilization of ideas and disciplines the digital age demands.\nOur PhD candidates pursue leading-edge tech research with guidance from faculty members in their respective fields. More broadly they have the opportunity to interact with the entire Cornell Tech campus to add business and entrepreneurial perspectives to their work.\nThe Runway Startup Postdocs Program is part business school, part research institution, and part startup incubator. Based at the Jacobs Technion-Cornell Institute, Runway ushers recent PhDs in digital technology fields from an academic mindset to an entrepreneurial outlook.\n• Master's Programs

It is a year-long immersion in innovation, creativity and new business development that will have you learning side-by-side with designers, engineers and business students. Working together in teams, you’ll create new products for existing businesses in the Product Studio and develop your own new business in the Startup Studio or work inside businesses or organizations in PiTech Studio or BigCo Studio. You will dive into studying law and building the transactional skills that emerging technology companies need in practitioner-led courses designed specifically for this program. You will also have ample opportunity to network with the vibrant community of investors, business leaders and entrepreneurial faculty members that only a city like New York and a university like Cornell can provide.\nCornell Tech prepared me to work and communicate smoothly with engineers and business people, which is one of the most important skills a lawyer should adopt when dealing with tech clients.\nThe two-semester Cornell Tech LLM will not by itself qualify most foreign-trained lawyers to sit for the New York State bar examination.* Students who require additional training to qualify to sit for the New York State bar examination may apply for the Cornell Tech LLM three-semester option.** After completing Fall and Spring terms at Cornell Tech three-semester students will spend an additional Fall term at Cornell Law School in Ithaca, New York. There students will have access to classes which meet the subject matter requirements set forth by the New York Board of Law Examiners.\n*Requirements vary according to educational background, and bar examination requirements change often. We cannot counsel individual applicants regarding these requirements prior to their admittance into the program. We recommend students who earned their law degree outside of the US review the New York State rules at https://www.nybarexam.org/foreign/foreignlegaleducation.htm.\n**The three-semester option requires an additional tuition payment. For the 2021-22 academic year 2-term tuition is $70,188 and 3-term tuition is $105,300.\nFeatured course\nProfessor of the Practice\nMatthew D’Amore is a Professor of Practice at Cornell Tech and in the Law School at Cornell University.

Recent LLM graduates work for firms and companies such as Allen & Overy, Buhler Duggal & Henry, ClassPass, Datalogue, and FastCase.\nCornell Tech was founded to advance technology as a means to a better quality of life for all communities in New York City, across the nation, and around the world. Our best work results in ethical, inclusive, accessible technology for all users, especially the underserved and underrepresented. Vital to that mission is building a diverse, equitable, and inclusive community of students, faculty, and staff. We seek to build things with — not just for — real people and believe in the power of participation and representation.\nIn Studio, you’ll create real products and technology solutions for organizations like Uber and the Robin Hood Foundation. You’ll also develop your own startup concept, and maybe even take the concept to market.\nThis program enables young lawyers to hit the ground running and provide value to their employers and to their clients, literally from day one.\nPartner, Dentons\nThe Master of Laws in Law, Technology and Entrepreneurship is for practicing attorneys or recent law graduates who want to further hone their legal and leadership skills in the heart of New York City’s ever-evolving technology and entrepreneurship ecosystem. Whether your law degree is from the U.S. or law school outside the U.S., if you have a law degree and are seeking to enhance your technology law knowledge and practice, we welcome your application.\nInternational students: Please note that the Cornell Tech LLM is not STEM-designated.\nView application deadlines and requirements.\nLearn more about program costs for the current academic year.\nCornell  University Financial Aid can provide more information about funding options for your program.\nResidents of The House at Cornell Tech enjoy high-end amenities and fully furnished apartments with a modern aesthetic.

Led by faculty who are actively shaping the future of Big Data, you’ll master the intricacies of optimal decision-making and machine learning. In parallel with your academic technical courses, you will also complete Studio courses—an essential component of every Cornell Tech program. These courses focus on preparing you for innovation within major tech companies or entrepreneurship within startup ventures. In cross-disciplinary teams, you’ll work with business, law, and other Cornell Tech students to create your own startup as well as develop usable solutions for real corporations. In the process, you’ll develop the business savvy and communication skills—as well as peerless technical know-how—that have made previous graduates prime recruiting targets of companies like Google, Facebook, and numerous startups.\nCornell Tech gave me the skills and confidence I needed to pursue a career in product management and data-driven decision making.”\nCornell Tech’s ORIE Masters is ideal for students with a passion for using data-derived insights to shape business decisions. The technical requirements are that you have completed one course on linear algebra, one course on intermediate-level probability and statistics, one course on calculus, and one course on programming before applying.\nCornell Tech offers another Masters degree in Data Science & Decision Analytics (DSDA). As is the case with all Masters programs at Cornell Tech, both ORIE and DSDA programs have an entrepreneurial focus, but ORIE emphasizes the intersection of optimization, machine learning and probabilistic analysis with business, whereas DSDA emphasizes the intersection of optimization, machine learning and probabilistic analysis with computing.\nA Master of Engineering in Operations Research and Information Engineering is also offered on Cornell’s Ithaca campus, with a focus on building operations research-related math and engineering skills, rather than Cornell Tech’s more entrepreneurial approach to developing mathematical modeling skills to inform business decisions. Learn more.\nIndividuals who are interested in the Financial Engineering Concentration and Cornell Financial Engineering Manhattan (CFEM) will need to apply to the Ithaca-based Operations Research program and should visit https://www.orie.cornell.edu/orie/cfem to learn more.\nUnlike the Ithaca-based ORIE Masters program, Cornell Tech does not offer a third semester option for their ORIE Masters students.\nTechnical Topics Covered\nOptimization Methods\nProbabilistic Analysis\nMachine Learning\nData Science\nModeling Under Uncertainty\nStudio Topics Covered\nEntrepreneurship\nIntellectual Property\nLaw for Non-Lawyers\nLeadership for Digital Transformation\nProduct Management\nStartup Funding & Pitching\nView the curriculum\nFeatured course\nHoward and Eleanor Morgan Professor\nGraduates of the ORIE program go off to careers in:\nAnd work in industries including:\nFor more information on employment outcomes visit our Career Management webpage\nA Master of Engineering in Operations Research and Information Engineering (ORIE) is also offered on Cornell’s Ithaca campus, with a focus on building traditional math, scientific, and engineering skills, rather than Cornell Tech’s more data-driven approach to teaching mathematical and modeling skills to inform strategic decisions.\nExperience the Cornell Tech culture with a visit to our NYC campus.\nCornell Tech’s employers include a wide range of mostly tech companies such as Google, Amazon, Facebook, Uber, Microsoft, Bloomberg, Datadog, Intersection, Oscar Health, ZocDoc and many others.\nCornell Tech was founded to advance technology as a means to a better quality of life for all communities in New York City, across the nation, and around the world. Our best work results in ethical, inclusive, accessible technology for all users, especially the underserved and underrepresented. Vital to that mission is building a diverse, equitable, and inclusive community of students, faculty, and staff. We seek to build things with — not just for — real people and believe in the power of participation and representation.\nLearn about on-campus housing options and living on Roosevelt Island.\n•

Study at the Ivy League level and acquire two leading degrees. And live in the heart of the ultimate urban ecosystem: New York City. Learn to apply machine learning, data science, human-computer interaction, and product design to the social, economic and technical challenges of a city in this transformational program. Our first-of-its-kind curriculum challenges you with the rigor of a computer science core, a firm grounding in how cities work and room to test your biggest ideas by building real products in the Studio.\nThe Jacobs Technion-Cornell Dual Master’s Degrees in Urban Tech provides students from a variety of undergraduate backgrounds a common view of how cities work and vocabulary for thinking of cities as systems of systems. Building on this foundation, the curriculum offers opportunities to specialize in digital technology areas that will impact the parts of cities they are passionate about, like urban mobility, data-supported resource management, proptech, smart cities, and many other topics related to today’s urban environment. The Urban Tech program affords students the ability to study, create, and deploy a variety of forms of urban tech, with a focus on using digital-related technology to make cities stronger, fairer, more livable, and more resilient.\nNo two Urban Tech students are alike, except for one thing: a deeply held belief in the possibilities tech holds for improving human lives in cities. You’ll study with renowned faculty from Cornell Tech, Cornell University, and the Technion. You’ll work in a collaborative setting with smart people experimenting with different disciplines and exploring their own potential. Then, you’ll present your work to experts from the larger New York tech community to test its viability. The freedom to study outside your technical area and the “radical collaboration” you’ll experience with students from every other Cornell Tech degree program will help you build strong ties that will serve you throughout your career.\nA defining characteristic of urban areas is density – of built structures, people, vehicles, businesses, and a broad array of resources.  With this concentration comes enormous numbers of connections between the elements.  As a result, modern cities are immensely complex interlocking systems of systems, yielding many challenges – and unique opportunities.\nUrban Tech is the development and deployment of technology that helps residents, workers, and governments manage density and transform it into an advantage for all who live in, work in, and visit cities.  In some cases, it is technology that is used exclusively in dense urban areas, like mass transportation, “smart” skyscrapers, and optimized surge traffic pricing.  In others, it is technology that is used broadly but has a substantial role and unique challenges in the city, like autonomous vehicles, broadband networks, and efficient package delivery.\nExperiment with applied machine learning, human-computer interaction, algorithms, data structures and more in rigorous computer science and engineering courses.\nComplement your tech skills with an understanding of cities as complex systems of systems, urban data, urban design strategies and case studies, behavioral economics, social theory, and more.\nPractice leadership, product design, startup management and other skills on teams with MBA, law, and engineering students in this required component of all Cornell Tech programs.\nTechnical Topics\nUrban Tech Topics\nStudio Topics\nThe two-semester Specialization Project gives you the opportunity to take a deep dive into a topic of your choosing, honing specialized skills, implementing novel prototypes, analyzing complex data sets, or pursuing user-centered design studies.\nYou will complete the project requirement in one of two ways:\nAnchor Course + Self-Directed Project\nFaculty-Directed Independent Study\n* Approved anchor course list available per program\n** Projects may be done independently or with partner(s).\nStephen M.

Our recent graduates have found full-time employment with leading companies such as Amazon-Fresh, CARMERA, Convergent Energy and Power, Uber, WeWork, Zillow and others. A number of graduates start their own ventures.\nCornell Tech was founded to advance technology as a means to a better quality of life for all communities in New York City, across the nation, and around the world. Our best work results in ethical, inclusive, accessible technology for all users, especially the underserved and underrepresented.\nVital to that mission is building a diverse, equitable, and inclusive community of students, faculty, and staff. We seek to build things with — not just for — real people and believe in the power of participation and representation.\nThe Jacobs Institute co-hosted “A New Day for the MTA,” a recent conference with the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) of New York City to explore solutions to an aging transit system that moves 8.6 million people a day. The conference continued Cornel Tech’s partnership with the MTA to incorporate emerging technology for the sustainability of the entire transit system.\nWith its central location in the heart of New York City, Cornell Tech provides its students with exceptional access to the city’s vibrant and growing tech sector and an immersive, authentic urban living experience. On-campus housing is available at The House at Cornell Tech, the first residential high-rise built to Passive House standards. In fact, the Cornell Tech campus is one of the most environmentally friendly and energy-efficient campuses in the world — and just one subway stop from Midtown.\nThe Jacobs Institute fosters radical experimentation at the intersection of research, education, and entrepreneurship. Established jointly by Cornell University and the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, our mission is to transform key industries through technological innovation, deep-tech startups, and uniquely skilled talent.\nWe welcome ambitious students who have a fascination with people-driven technologies and a strong entrepreneurial spirit — and an abiding passion for the future of our cities. A formal academic background in computer science or engineering is not required, but ideal candidates will have strong quantitative skills and/or programming experience with an interest in the urban environment. We are looking for tech-savvy urban planners, architects and policy experts; and statisticians, engineers and computer scientists who are passionate about applications in urban settings.\nWe will take into account personal or professional experience in mathematics, economics, physical sciences or other quantitative disciplines. Essentially, your application should demonstrate somehow that you will be able to successfully complete the computer science component of the curriculum, as well as your interest in the human and social aspects of it. It should also show us where your desire to meld technology with urban systems comes from.\nWe especially welcome female applicants and encourage women considering the program to visit our Women in Technology & Entrepreneurship in New York initiative for information on fellowships and other types of support.\nView application deadlines and requirements.\nFind info on program costs for the current academic year.\nVisit the Cornell University site to learn about financial aid opportunities.\nExplore the stunning campus of Cornell Tech on Roosevelt Island, in the heart of New York City.\nEmployers in the urban tech ecosystem are frustrated with the typical urban planning or compsci graduate because they can’t work across disciplines or across systems. We’ve heard a clear need for candidates who can offer deep expertise in tech and a broad-based systems perspective — as well as hands-on work experience. Graduates of this program will be positioned to land better jobs in ‘cooler’ places and get to points of responsibility much more quickly than if they came out of a traditional degree program.”\nCo-Director and Professor\nThe concentration in Urban Tech will welcome its inaugural class in Fall 2020. The concentration is the result of a collaboration between the Jacobs Technion-Cornell Institute, the College of Architecture, Art and Planning, the Faculty of Computing and Information Science, and Cornell Engineering.\nThough the Urban Tech concentration is new, the focus on developing emerging urban tech tools is not new at Cornell Tech. More than a dozen teams of graduate students are currently working on Urban Tech projects in the Product Studio course, where students across Cornell Tech’s seven masters programs tackle real-life challenges posed by businesses and organizations.\nIn partnership with ARUP, the MTA, the New York City Mayor’s Office, the City of Holyoke and many more organizations, students are already developing new technologies in response to questions such as: “how might cities reduce gas consumption and greenhouse gas emissions as we move towards a renewable future?”; “how might we improve access to transportation for people with special needs?”; and “how might we enhance safety for domestic violence survivors in their homes and communities?”\nThe degree program is part of The Jacobs Institute’s new Urban Tech Hub, which will also include applied research and startups. The Urban Tech Hub was established in part thanks to the Julis Rabinowitz Family, who provided support for the necessary research and scoping to ensure the hub was meeting industry needs.\nRead the

broad array of resources.  With this concentration comes enormous numbers of connections between the elements.  As a result, modern cities are immensely complex interlocking systems of systems, yielding many challenges – and unique opportunities.\nUrban Tech is the development and deployment of technology that helps residents, workers, and governments manage density and transform it into an advantage for all who live in, work in, and visit cities.  In some cases, it is technology that is used exclusively in dense urban areas, like mass transportation, “smart” skyscrapers, and optimized surge traffic pricing.  In others, it is technology that is used broadly but has a substantial role and unique challenges in the city, like autonomous vehicles, broadband networks, and efficient package delivery.\n[CARD]\nWhat Is Urban Tech?\n[CARD]\nA defining characteristic of urban areas is density – of built structures, people, vehicles, businesses, and a broad array of resources.  With

Successful connective media platforms—such as iOS, Facebook, Reddit, The New York Times, and Uber—merge social science, information science, computer science, and engineering to change not just the way society uses technology, but the very fabric of society itself. Look at Facebook, for instance: is it a communication tool, is it an information tool, is it media? It is changing the way that we behave as a society: the way we act, the way we get information, the way we diffuse information, the way we shape our views and our culture. Connective media devices, apps, and networked systems are an important and increasingly necessary part of how we work, learn, shop, communicate—even drive. Everything has changed and will continue to change because of this convergence.”\nNote: Mor Naaman was founder of Connective Media and its first director.\nHow is this program different from a human-computer interaction (HCI) program?\n“The requirements of the Connective Media program are much more technical than those of HCI programs. You can finish an HCI program without knowing how to program, but to complete this program you must acquire deep technical skills in computer science and engineering. Students can also take advanced technical courses in areas like machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing that are not available in most HCI programs.”\nWhat makes this program the first of its kind?\n“Many new computer science-based programs touch a domain like public health or industrial design or human-computer interaction (HCI), but they don’t go into the technical depth that this programs does. This program gives students a breadth of knowledge in a domain, the social aspect of computing, and also challenges students to go deeper into technology and advanced computer science areas such as applied machine learning, data mining, signal processing, natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, cryptography, cybersecurity, and blockchain, among others.”\nWhat’s an example of how I could apply what I learn in the program?\n“Recently, a Connective Media graduate that went to work at Twitter got in touch. He sent me a direct message on Twitter excitedly, saying, ‘Today we used something in our product that we learned in your course.’ I said, ‘What is it?’ He said, ‘It’s the strength of weak ties theory by Granovetter.’ This is dating back to the 1970s when Granovetter first articulated this social theory, which we covered in class. The graduate used the theory for the (very well-known) social media company they work for while developing a machine learning algorithm to rank social content. At the highest levels of technology, it’s not uncommon to encounter sophisticated thinking like this and it gave me satisfaction to know we’re preparing leaders who can think this way.”\nWhat kinds of careers do Connective Media graduates enter?\n“We’ve had students go on to take engineering roles, data science,  product roles, and even design roles in companies, startups, and others. Our career management services are bar none and will really work hard to help you find a role that matches your interests and talents. Our students end up as interns, then full time employees, in companies like Amazon, Google, Facebook, eBay, Bloomberg, and other companies large and small. The degree definitely opens doors, though you might have to explain a bit what the title means! It can be a conversation starter.”\nWhat can I expect to walk away with when I complete the program?\n“Part of what makes this degree more exciting is the project work and teamwork that happens throughout your time here. Every semester essentially, you’ll have one significant project that you’re working on, whether it’s a project for Studio in the first semester or the Specialization Project in semesters two and three or the Startup Studio project in semester four. When these all align, which happens often but not always, you will have a very strong portfolio that allows you to become a real expert in a certain area.”\nCornell Tech offers best-in-class career management services to set you up for success after graduation.

Cornell Tech’s Master’s in Decision Science and Decision Analytics (DSDA) will provide you the tools to understand the data-to-algorithms-to-decisions pipeline by drawing from tools in machine learning, optimization and statistics.\nCornell Tech’s DSDA Masters allows you to develop a theoretical and practical understanding of the data-to-models-to-decisions pipeline in entrepreneurial environments by drawing from tools in machine learning, optimization and statistics. After going through the program, you will be able to develop and deploy algorithms to drive the decisions of online business such as e-retailers, ride-sharing systems and ad exchanges. Working with the faculty that are world leaders in optimization, statistics, causal analysis and machine learning, as well as being immersed in the tech start-up community of New York City, you will get comfortable with analyzing data, building decision models that turn data into decisions and deploying these models at large scale. In parallel with your academic technical courses, you will also complete Studio courses – an essential component of every Cornell Tech program that allow you to solve real business problems faced by tech companies and launch your own startups. During the course of Studio courses, you will work in cross-disciplinary teams with students in computers science, electrical engineering, business and law programs to study all facets of the problem you are focusing on.\nWho Should Apply?\nCornell Tech’s DSDA Masters is ideal for students with a passion for data analysis that create insights to drive business decisions. The technical requirements are that you have completed one course on linear algebra, one course on intermediate-level probability and statistics, one course on calculus, and one course on programming before applying. Cornell Tech offers another Masters degree in Operations Research and Information Engineering (ORIE). As is the case with all Masters programs at Cornell Tech, both DSDA and ORIE programs have an entrepreneurial focus, but DSDA emphasizes the intersection of optimization, machine learning and probabilistic analysis with computing, whereas ORIE emphasizes the intersection of optimization, machine learning and probabilistic analysis with business.\nTechnical Topics Covered\nStudio Topics

Now available part-time for applicants with flexible schedules it offers an immersion in innovation, creativity and new business development that will have you learning side-by-side with designers, engineers and business students. Working together in teams, you’ll create new products for existing businesses in the Product Studio and develop your own new business in the Startup Studio or work inside businesses or organizations in PiTech Studio or BigCo Studio. You will dive into studying law and building the transactional skills that emerging technology companies need in practitioner-led courses designed specifically for this program. You will also have ample opportunity to network with the vibrant community of investors, business leaders and entrepreneurial faculty members that only a city like New York and a university like Cornell can provide.\nCornell Tech prepared me to work and communicate smoothly with engineers and business people, which is one of the most important skills a lawyer should adopt when dealing with tech clients.”\nThe part-time path is a different way to take our rigorous Tech LLM Program, and therefore contains the exact curriculum requirements as the full-time program. The only difference is that students taking the part-time option can complete their coursework over 2 years, doing 8-9 credits per semester for a total of 33 credits. The program is fully in-person for both part- and full-time students.\nThe part-time Tech LLM allows students to participate fully in the Tech LLM curriculum while attending only two to three days per week. Classes are mostly offered during the day (with a few electives at night), so the program is best for those with flexible schedules who can take two days per week to engage in studies to advance their career.\nStudents should expect their two-year curriculum to proceed generally as follows:\nYear 1 - Fall: Take classes on Monday and Wednesday\nRequired (all offered day time on Monday and/or Wednesday)\nYear 1 - Spring: Take classes on Monday and Wednesday\nYear 2 - Fall: Take classes on Tuesday and Thursday\nRequired (all offered day time on Tuesday and/or Thursday)\nYear 2 - Spring: Take classes on Tuesday and Thursday\nSample Electives [offerings will vary year to year]\nThe part-time Cornell Tech LLM will not by itself qualify most foreign-trained lawyers to sit for the New York State bar examination.* In addition, students in the part-time program are not eligible for F-1 or J-1 visa sponsorship. Students who require additional training to qualify to sit for the New York State bar examination are encouraged to apply for the full-time Cornell Tech LLM three-semester option. The Cornell Tech LLM is not STEM-Designated.\n*Requirements vary according to educational background, and bar examination requirements change often. We cannot counsel individual applicants regarding these requirements prior to their admittance into the program. We recommend students who earned their law degree outside of the US review the New York State rules at https://www.nybarexam.org/foreign/foreignlegaleducation.htm.\nFeatured course\nProfessor of the Practice\nMatthew D’Amore is a Professor of Practice at Cornell Tech and in the Law School at Cornell University.
