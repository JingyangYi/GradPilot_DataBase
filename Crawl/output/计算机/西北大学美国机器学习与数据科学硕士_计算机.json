It is a really cutting-edge program, in that you're learning some of the most recent trends and techniques that are out there, and it's really exciting.”\n“\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI visited quite a few schools, but the Master of Science in Analytics* program was by far the most appealing because of its great reputation, its small class size, the curriculum's mix of mathematics, programming, and the business skill set needed.”\n“\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe program checked all of the boxes. The faculty consists of the best and brightest in their respective field, and many of them provide masterclasses in instruction. Without the engineering know-how I gained in MSiA*, I wouldn't be nearly as comfortable with this line of work.”\n“\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThat experience gave me the confidence to look at any new framework, tool, or technology from the perspective of an experienced student who knows he can attain mastery over another wave of disruptive technology as long as he shows the same discipline and passion”\n“\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI really wanted to study in a program that embraced me applying my data science skills to real-life problems. The hands-on approach of the program was a plus to me. Real-industry projects give you the opportunity to reinforce what has been learned in class, but also to challenge yourself, develop your curiosity, and go beyond your capabilities”\nUnique program features\nWhile many programs focus on just one aspect of analytics like modeling or data mining, our program provides students with a rigorous course of study in all three areas of analytics: predictive (forecasting), descriptive (business intelligence and data mining), and prescriptive (optimization and simulation).\nEach course in the program builds upon previous courses and is complemented by case studies, team projects, and guest speakers from industry, ensuring an academic experience that’s grounded in business reality. This holistic approach prepares graduates to solve data-centric, complex business challenges through the lens of experience.\nDeep dive into our comprehensive and applied curriculum.
