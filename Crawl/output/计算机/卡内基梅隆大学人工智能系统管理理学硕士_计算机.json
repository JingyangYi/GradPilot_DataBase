This course lists a prerequisite, but some students have been successful without the formal prerequisite course if they possess the equivalent experience in a high-level programming language such as C, C++, or Java. PARKLAND COLLEGEAt Parkland College, the following class has been pre-approved as a prerequisite programming course for admission to Heinz College:CSC 140 Computer Science I (Java) FOOTHILL COLLEGEAt Foothill College, the following class has been pre-approved as a prerequisite programming course for admission to Heinz College:C S 1A Object-Oriented Programming Methodologies in JavaC S 2A Object-Oriented Programming Methodologies in C++Excelsior CollegeAt Excelsior College, the following class has been pre-approved as a prerequisite programming course for admission to Heinz College:IT210 Object Oriented ProgrammingNote that you may enroll in the 8 or 15 week sections. Both section types offer the same content, with the 8-week long courses covering the material at a faster pace.Carnegie Mellon University (Current CMU Students Only)At Carnegie Mellon University, the following classes have been pre-approved as a prerequisite programming course for admission to Heinz College:17-214: Principles of Software Construction: Objects, Design, and Concurrency15-121: Introduction to Data StructuresNote that prerequisite courses may be required and students should consult with their advisor prior to registering for the course.\nCourse Descriptions for Quantitative Preparation\n            \n\n\n\nStudents admitted to the AIM program are required to have undergraduate coursework in calculus and statistics prior to their first semester at Heinz College. You can meet this requirement by completing college-level courses with a grade of B or higher covering these topics.Students may want to consider enrolling in prerequisite coursework prior to applying for admission. Taking a calculus and/or statistics course is a great way to show the Admissions Committee you are proactively preparing for graduate school and fulfilling the prerequisites for enrollment.Prospective students who want to complete the prerequisite quantitative courses for admission to Heinz College should consider the descriptions below when looking for suitable classes in calculus and/or statistics.CALCULUSIdentify a college-level course that covers basic concepts including limits, derivatives, definite and indefinite integrals. At a minimum, the course should develop methods for application of those concepts to problems like curve sketching, related rates, linear and quadratic approximations, and maximum/minimum problems. STATISTICSIdentify an introductory, college-level course in probability/statistics. An appropriate course would be designed for students with very little or no background in statistics. At the conclusion of the course, students should have the basic tools for analyzing data and outcomes involving probabilistic circumstances. Topics should include probability and probability tables, conditional probability, Bayes' Rule, random variables and expected value, and a basic understanding of normal distribution and hypothesis testing.\nCarnegie Mellon University\n            \n\n\n\nReview our accelerated master's program info sheet for detailed information on the AIM Accelerated Master's Program for Carnegie Mellon University undergraduate students.\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\n    Didn't find what you were looking for on this page?

Object-oriented programming (OOP) has become a must-have technique in today’s high-tech software development jobs. \nIn this intermediate course, students will use Python to explore OOP techniques including: encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance. The material is introduced and explained through the development of graphical user interface elements and, in a fun way, by building highly approachable, simple computer games. The Python language, because of its simple syntax, makes the implementation of OOP very clear. To build interactivity, we will use the well-known Pygame extension to introduce event-driven programs. \nAlong the way, you will gain an intermediate level of understanding of the Python language.

The foundations of nursing practice include the care of culturally diverse patients experiencing health problems related to discomfort, pain, and sensory impairment. Growth and development and its relationship to health, injury prevention, illness, and continuity of care in a variety of settings are studied. Chronic illness, disability, and end of life needs, as well as pertinent ethical, legal, and regulatory requirements and the standards of professional nursing practice are addressed. Concepts and theories from the natural and social sciences are applied while caring for patients and families across the lifespan.\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\n• How many credits can I transfer?\n• How much is tuition?\n• How do I apply?\n• How do I request a transcript online?\n• How do I submit the TEAS test results?\n• What is OneTranscript and how does it work?\n• Is my employer an Excelsior University Partner?\n• Sitemap\n• Technical Help\n• Accessibility Statement\n[HTML_TABLE]\nPrerequisites | Credit Hours | Syllabus\nNone | 3 hours | View Sample\n[HTML_TABLE]\nTerm Dates\nTerm & Duration\nEmpty | Term & Duration\nEmpty | Empty\nSeptember 1, 2025 to October 26, 2025 | Fall I - 8 week | \nOctober 27, 2025 to December 21, 2025 | Fall II - 8 week | \nJanuary 5, 2026 to March 1, 2026 | Spring I - 8 week | \nMarch 2, 2026 to April 26, 2026 | Spring II - 8 week | \nMay 4, 2026 to June 28, 2026 | Summer I - 8 week | \nJune 29, 2026 to August 23, 2026 | Summer II - 8 week |\n[HTML_TABLE]\nPrerequisites | Credit Hours | Syllabus\nACC 211 Financial Accounting | 3 hours | View Sample\n[HTML_TABLE]\nPrerequisites | Credit Hours | Syllabus\nACC211 Financial Accounting and ACC212 Managerial Accounting | 3 hours | View Sample\n[HTML_TABLE]\nTerm Dates\nTerm & Duration\nEmpty | Term & Duration\nEmpty | Empty\nSeptember 1, 2025 to October 26, 2025 | Fall I - 8 week |\n[HTML_TABLE]\nPrerequisites | Credit Hours | Syllabus\nACC314 Intermediate Accounting I | 3 hours | View Sample\n[HTML_TABLE]\nTerm Dates\nTerm & Duration\nEmpty | Term & Duration\nEmpty | Empty\nOctober 27, 2025 to December 21, 2025 | Fall II - 8 week |\n[HTML_TABLE]\nPrerequisites | Credit Hours | Syllabus\nACC212 Managerial;

Management guru, W. Edwards Deming, once said all  management is prediction of future results  (Wood & Wood, 2005). If we do not know how to estimate the impacts of decisions on future outcomes, we limit ourselves to guessing with our gut instead of applying a real analysis based on data science (Bonabeau, 2003). In this course, students will learn how to develop Excel statistical and decision models and create basic data visualizations, which will help students become data savvy and provide them with essential Excel skills, both of which are necessary to be competitive in a professional work environment. It will include a review of important statistical methods; use of time series for forecasting; application of regression analysis; aspects of decision theory including model building, linear optimization, simulation, optimization with and without risk and uncertainty; and methods to effectively communicate the results and rationales to management in tables and using graphs. The course also includes use of Tableau to create more effective data visualizations and data stories. Students will install Tableau on their computer a 1-year free Tableau Student license.\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\nCredit Hours\nSyllabus\n\n\nBUS233 Business Statistics or BUS231 Business Data Literacy\n3 hours\nView Sample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerm Dates\nTerm & Duration\nEmpty\n\n\n\nSeptember 1, 2025 to October 26, 2025\nFall I - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nOctober 27, 2025 to December 21, 2025\nFall II - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 5, 2026 to March 1, 2026\nSpring I - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nMarch 2, 2026 to April 26, 2026\nSpring II - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nMay 4, 2026 to June 28, 2026\nSummer I - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nJune 29, 2026 to August 23, 2026\nSummer II - 8 week\n\n\n\nRegister\nAdmitted and Enrolled Students\nIf you're enrolled in a degree program at Excelsior, you need your academic advisor's approval before registering for courses.\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\n\nNon-matriculated and Visiting Students\nIf you're a non-matriculated student, you can register anytime.\nREGISTER\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBUS435\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternational Business    Upper, 3 cr.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription \nIn this course, we'll examine and analyze global business in its historical, theoretical, environmental, and functional dimensions.

Distributed workforces use a variety of telecommunication networks and tools to establish connectivity as well as provide organizational policies and procedures, email​, and interactive meetings. Distributed teams encompass organizations that (1) offer flexible work arrangements and whose employees work out of home offices rather than on-site​; and (2) have employees who are geographically distant. Employers have acknowledged that managing distributed employees is different than managing employees on-site, noting ​that it is difficult to keep employees engaged and connected. Thus, distributed workplaces have created challenges to organizational behavior. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics has reported that the need for managers who know how to manage distributed employees is growing at a faster-than-average rate. Research has suggested that when strategically planned and implemented, distributed work programs increase productivity, increase job satisfaction, increase loyalty, ease work-life integration​, and reduce employee stress and burnout. This course will offer management and leadership strategies that will contribute to the success of organizations, including distributed organizations. You will discover how individual differences impact organizations, learn how to apply management and leadership skills to specific situations, apply proper business ethics, and examine how culture plays a role in today s global business world.\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\nCredit Hours\nSyllabus\n\n\nNone\n3 hours\nView Sample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerm Dates\nTerm & Duration\nEmpty\n\n\n\nSeptember 1, 2025 to October 26, 2025\nFall I - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nOctober 27, 2025 to December 21, 2025\nFall II - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 5, 2026 to March 1, 2026\nSpring I - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nMarch 2, 2026 to April 26, 2026\nSpring II - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nMay 4, 2026 to June 28, 2026\nSummer I - 8 week\n\n\n\nRegister\nAdmitted and Enrolled Students\nIf you're enrolled in a degree program at Excelsior, you need your academic advisor's approval before registering for courses.\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\n\nNon-matriculated and Visiting Students\nIf you're a non-matriculated student, you can register anytime.\nREGISTER\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBUS554\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChange Management    Grad, 3 cr.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription \nThis course is a study of the process of change and change management that focuses on the necessity of change in today's globally competitive environment, the type and manner of change taking place within organizations, and identifying the key challenges and opportunities associated with each type of change.

Keeping together is progress. Working together is success.\" Teamwork plays a critical role in organizational success. Teamwork is important in organizations because it offers employees opportunities to collaborate with each other and thus improve their communication, social support, respect, trust and working relations.  In addition, teamwork brings together diverse employees; consequently, stereotypes about diverse groups are replaced with realities. Collaborating on various projects enables employees to share responsibilities; every employee has a role that suits their expertise. Since 2020 the world has seen an unprecedented growth in distributed employees as a consequence of COVID-19. Distributed workforces use a variety of telecommunication networks and tools to establish connectivity as well as provide organizational policies and procedures, email and interactive meetings. Distributed teams encompass organizations that (1) offer flexible work arrangements and whose employees work out of home offices rather than on site and (2) have employees who are geographically distant.

These fundamental security measures are integral in protecting cloud data, support regulatory compliance and protect customers' privacy as well as setting authentication rules for individual users and devices. This course will cover principles such as authenticating access to filtering traffic and will be closely aligned with the ISC2 CCSP (Certified Cloud Security Professional). Cloud security can be customized to the exact needs of the business which provides flexibility for an organization. These rules can be configured and managed in one place, administration overheads are reduced and IT teams empowered to focus on other areas of the business. Training is needed to properly assess the various applications of cloud security and how it is delivered. Some decisions will depend on the individual cloud provider or the cloud security solutions in place. This course will define those parameters. Students registering for this course will be assessed a course resource fee.\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\nCredit Hours\nSyllabus\n\n\nCYS500 Foundations of Cybersecurity\n3 hours\nView Sample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerm Dates\nTerm & Duration\nEmpty\n\n\n\nSeptember 1, 2025 to October 26, 2025\nFall I - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 5, 2026 to March 1, 2026\nSpring I - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nMay 4, 2026 to June 28, 2026\nSummer I - 8 week\n\n\n\nRegister\nAdmitted and Enrolled Students\nIf you're enrolled in a degree program at Excelsior, you need your academic advisor's approval before registering for courses.\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\n\nNon-matriculated and Visiting Students\nIf you're a non-matriculated student, you can register anytime.\nREGISTER\n\n \n \n \n \nEconomics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tECO260\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIntroduction to Microeconomics    Lower, 3 cr.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription \nShould a manufacturer produce automobiles or ventilators? Should a local government intervene when sugar cane farmers in an area burn stalks to expose cane and the smoke results in a costly rise in asthma treatment among children in a state-run Medicaid program? In this course you will sharpen your ability to understand choices you or others face in a range of personal, professional and public contexts as you are introduced to the framework economists use to compare alternatives faced by individuals, businesses and governments. Governments uniquely make rules. Governments also impose taxes offer incentives and make choices to redistribute wealth, protect, regulate hiring and conditions of work, internet service and air quality. It may surprise you to learn how microeconomic tools introduced in this course can be applied in such diverse contexts to measure and compare relative costs and benefits. \n\n\n\nPrerequisites\nCredit Hours\nSyllabus\n\n\nNone\n3 hours\nView Sample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerm Dates\nTerm & Duration\nEmpty\n\n\n\nSeptember 1, 2025 to October 26, 2025\nFall I - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nOctober 27, 2025 to December 21, 2025\nFall II - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 5, 2026 to March 1, 2026\nSpring I - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nMay 4, 2026 to June 28, 2026\nSummer I - 8 week\n\n\n\nRegister\nAdmitted and Enrolled Students\nIf you're enrolled in a degree program at Excelsior, you need your academic advisor's approval before registering for courses.\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\n\nNon-matriculated and Visiting Students\nIf you're a non-matriculated student, you can register anytime.\nREGISTER\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tECO262\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIntroduction to Macroeconomics    Lower, 3 cr.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription \nDo you hear a lot about interest rates? How about negative interest rates? Macroeconomists consider interest rates and other economic  variables  because interest rates affect activities like hiring and firing of workers (employment) across a whole economy and even worldwide. You might care about interest rates because these affect borrowing costs. Interest rates also affect home and rental pricing and changes in pay on a yearly basis. In this course you will learn how economists measure and forecast economic factors like those mentioned here to assist state, local and federal governments in maintaining services to citizens, price stability and the broadest level of employment possible. You will also learn how powerfully macroeconomic factors affect you directly.\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\nCredit Hours\nSyllabus\n\n\nNone\n3 hours\nView Sample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerm Dates\nTerm & Duration\nEmpty\n\n\n\nSeptember 1, 2025 to October 26, 2025\nFall I - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nOctober 27, 2025 to December 21, 2025\nFall II - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nMarch 2, 2026 to April 26, 2026\nSpring II - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nJune 29, 2026 to August 23, 2026\nSummer II - 8 week\n\n\n\nRegister\nAdmitted and Enrolled Students\nIf you're enrolled in a degree program at Excelsior, you need your academic advisor's approval before registering for courses.\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\n\nNon-matriculated and Visiting Students\nIf you're a non-matriculated student, you can register anytime.\nREGISTER\n\n \n \n \n \nElectrical\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tELEC152\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCircuit Theory I    Lower, 4 cr.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription \nThis course provides an introduction to the various principles of electrical circuit analysis.

Our course has three threads: Earth, as represented by the four natural spheres atmosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere. Each of these spheres is addressed individually in modules in the course. Society, as represented through the effects of Earth processes on humans and society and the effects of the human existence on the physical nature of the Earth. Technology, which has greatly expanded in geoscience research. You will use these technologies in researching information related to your final project. These threads are tied together by our semester-long project that enables you to relate your studies directly to your community. Everyone will select a study area your hometown, your current location, or another area with which you are familiar and conduct a mini Natural Resources Inventory of the area as related to each of the four natural spheres. You will identify natural resources such as climate, waterways, land cover (forests, grasslands, etc.), and geologic hazards (sinkholes, landslides, volcanoes, etc.) specific to your study area. Then, you will assess the quality of the air and water, any degradation to the land cover, and any negative effects of geologic hazards. Finally, to complete the project, you will suggest mitigation strategies that you will present along with the resource identification and quality assessments in an audio/visual presentation.\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\nCredit Hours\nSyllabus\n\n\nNone\n3 hours\nView Sample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerm Dates\nTerm & Duration\nEmpty\n\n\n\nSeptember 1, 2025 to October 26, 2025\nFall I - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nOctober 27, 2025 to December 21, 2025\nFall II - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 5, 2026 to March 1, 2026\nSpring I - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nMarch 2, 2026 to April 26, 2026\nSpring II - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nMay 4, 2026 to June 28, 2026\nSummer I - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nJune 29, 2026 to August 23, 2026\nSummer II - 8 week\n\n\n\nRegister\nAdmitted and Enrolled Students\nIf you're enrolled in a degree program at Excelsior, you need your academic advisor's approval before registering for courses.\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\n\nNon-matriculated and Visiting Students\nIf you're a non-matriculated student, you can register anytime.\nREGISTER\n\n \n \n \n \nHealth Sciences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHSC112\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMedical Terminology    Lower, 3 cr.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription \nThis course will prepare you for accurate oral and written use of medical language in a variety of health care settings and from multiple practitioner perspectives.

Borne out of imperial rivalries and complex European alliances, the war erupted suddenly in 1914 and ended more than four years later, at the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month. In the years between, the Allied and Central Powers engaged in a horrific and devastating  Total War,  drafting unprecedentedly large armies and transforming their economies to support the war effort, yet producing little more than stalemate and death on much of the Western Front. The Great War changed how wars were fought and introduced new technology to the battlefield. Students in this course will examine the origins and consequences of the war, the major strategic decisions, as well as the intertwining history on the home front of the combatant nations. Students will engage with the historical material through innovative games and simulations, designed to allow students to experience the major decision points and strategy during World War I as if they were really there. Along with the simulations, students will read primary source accounts of the war to understand the war s significance, its toll on the  Lost Generation,  and its ramifications more than one hundred years later. Note: This course includes gaming technology that requires students to have a web browser that meets the minimum Excelsior University requirements. \n\n\n\nPrerequisites\nCredit Hours\nSyllabus\n\n\nNone\n3 hours\nView Sample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerm Dates\nTerm & Duration\nEmpty\n\n\n\nOctober 27, 2025 to December 21, 2025\nFall II - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nMarch 2, 2026 to April 26, 2026\nSpring II - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nJune 29, 2026 to August 23, 2026\nSummer II - 8 week\n\n\n\nRegister\nAdmitted and Enrolled Students\nIf you're enrolled in a degree program at Excelsior, you need your academic advisor's approval before registering for courses.\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\n\nNon-matriculated and Visiting Students\nIf you're a non-matriculated student, you can register anytime.\nREGISTER\n\n \n \n \n \nHomeland Security and Emergency Mgmt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHEM125\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIntroduction to Homeland Security    Lower, 3 cr.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription \nThis course provides an overview of the discipline of homeland security and emergency management.

We look at current Western practices surrounding end-of-life care, the processing and acknowledgment of grief, and the tendency to deny our very mortality. We witness what people in stigmatized groups undergo when they seek medical treatment. And we confront what happens when a person, either ill or well, decides to end their life on their own terms.

You will apply basic principles of physics to the analysis of systems experiencing some combination of forces and torques, with an eye toward engineering applications. Statics deals with two and three-dimensional systems of particles and rigid bodies in static equilibrium. In a general sense, each principle is applied first to a particle, then to a rigid body subjected to a coplanar system of forces, and finally, to three-dimensional force systems acting on a rigid body. Special attention devoted to forces in structures such as truss, frames, and machines. After building a fundamental understanding of these topics, we will explore analysis of internal forces developed in structural members. Vector algebra will be used throughout. The subject is called statics because it is concerned with particles and rigid bodies that are in equilibrium; these will usually be stationary (i.e. static).\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\nCredit Hours\nSyllabus\n\n\nEGR280 Introduction to 3-D Modeling, and PHYS201 Physics I, and PHYS202 Physics I Laboratory,  MAT120 Precalculus, and MAT220 Calculus I, and MAT221 Calculus II\n3 hours\nView Sample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerm Dates\nTerm & Duration\nEmpty\n\n\n\nSeptember 1, 2025 to October 26, 2025\nFall I - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nMay 4, 2026 to June 28, 2026\nSummer I - 8 week\n\n\n\nRegister\nAdmitted and Enrolled Students\nIf you're enrolled in a degree program at Excelsior, you need your academic advisor's approval before registering for courses.\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\n\nNon-matriculated and Visiting Students\nIf you're a non-matriculated student, you can register anytime.\nREGISTER\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMET225\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStrength of Materials    Lower, 3 cr.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription \nStrength of Materials addresses the stresses that are formed in rigid bodies due to the application of forces and torques.

During the next eight weeks, we will be exploring this big, beautiful universe of ours! The itinerary of our voyage allows, after a brief look at a few key physical principles and the history of their development, a look at the cosmos on an increasingly large scale. Our journey will begin with a detailed study of our solar system as well as a discussion of planetary systems around other stars that are being discovered almost daily. From there, we'll examine the nature of stars how they are born, live, and die, and how they constitute the fundamental building blocks of one of the most important cosmic structures, the galaxy. This study of galaxy formation and evolution will lead us into a brief exploration of the current research in cosmology, including the as-of-yet\r\nundiscovered nature of dark energy and dark matter.

When you fill up your tank, have you ever wondered where the fuel comes from or what it takes to make this necessary energy source so readily available?  When you hear about costly wars or domestic strife in energy-rich regions like Russia or the Middle East, do you question how these might be related?  Beyond the near constant power rivalry over energy, even alternative energy technologies, global climate change looms as an almost incalculable cost.  In this course you develop a geopolitical lens onto energy and climate change by looking at powerful state, military and corporate actors, each pursuing its own, often conflicting, objectives.  You examine how these actors influence energy geopolitics and climate change, such as in dealing with the security implications of increased sea levels, storm intensities, Arctic melt and drought.  In this course you examine the political realities of energy today and the possibilities of different tomorrows.\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\nCredit Hours\nSyllabus\n\n\nNone\n3 hours\nView Sample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerm Dates\nTerm & Duration\nEmpty\n\n\n\nOctober 27, 2025 to December 21, 2025\nFall II - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nMarch 2, 2026 to April 26, 2026\nSpring II - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nJune 29, 2026 to August 23, 2026\nSummer II - 8 week\n\n\n\nRegister\nAdmitted and Enrolled Students\nIf you're enrolled in a degree program at Excelsior, you need your academic advisor's approval before registering for courses.\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\n\nNon-matriculated and Visiting Students\nIf you're a non-matriculated student, you can register anytime.\nREGISTER\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPOL351\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWar and Peace After the Cold War    Upper, 3 cr.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription \nThis course analyzes key actors and trends in international relations since the end of the Cold War in 1989-1991. The course explores how cooperation accompanying the end of the Cold War faded into an Age of Terror and great power rivalry. Students look at conflict and cooperation throughout the post-Cold War period, and use the leading international relations theories to evaluate important events, including: the end of the Cold War; the Balkans Wars; the rise of the interdependent global economy; Islamic Fundamentalism and the War on Terror; Russia-China-US competition emerging since 2008; and, the fate of American dominance of world politics. The course ends with the contemporary debate over America s role as global leader amidst challenges from ascending states like China and non-state threats from terrorist groups and global health and climate dilemmas.\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\nCredit Hours\nSyllabus\n\n\nNone\n3 hours\nView Sample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerm Dates\nTerm & Duration\nEmpty\n\n\n\nOctober 27, 2025 to December 21, 2025\nFall II - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nMarch 2, 2026 to April 26, 2026\nSpring II - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nJune 29, 2026 to August 23, 2026\nSummer II - 8 week\n\n\n\nRegister\nAdmitted and Enrolled Students\nIf you're enrolled in a degree program at Excelsior, you need your academic advisor's approval before registering for courses.\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\n\nNon-matriculated and Visiting Students\nIf you're a non-matriculated student, you can register anytime.\nREGISTER\n\n \n \n \n \nPsychology\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPSY101\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIntroduction to Psychology I    Lower, 3 cr.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription \nIn this course, you'll apply psychological principles and theory to your everyday life.  In addition to foundational topics like psychology as a science, learning and memory, human development, and consciousness, you will learn about some more specific topics like stress and health, psychological disorders and therapy, and human sexuality.

Distributed workforces use a variety of telecommunication networks and tools to establish connectivity as well as provide organizational policies and procedures, email​, and interactive meetings. Distributed teams encompass organizations that (1) offer flexible work arrangements and whose employees work out of home offices rather than on-site​; and (2) have employees who are geographically distant. Employers have acknowledged that managing distributed employees is different than managing employees on-site, noting ​that it is difficult to keep employees engaged and connected. Thus, distributed workplaces have created challenges to organizational behavior. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics has reported that the need for managers who know how to manage distributed employees is growing at a faster-than-average rate. Research has suggested that when strategically planned and implemented, distributed work programs increase productivity, increase job satisfaction, increase loyalty, ease work-life integration​, and reduce employee stress and burnout. This course will offer management and leadership strategies that will contribute to the success of organizations, including distributed organizations.

The second part builds on cryptography to design secure protocols for confidentiality, authentication, and data integrity. Examples will include IPSec (Internet Protocol Security), SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)/TLS (Transport Layer Security), and VPNs (Virtual Private Network). The third part covers how cyber attacks proceed from reconnaissance to exploits and intrusions. Particular emphasis is given on web attacks (such as phishing, SQL (Structured Query Language) injection, drive-by downloads) and malware. The last part of the course will focus on intrusion prevention, detection, and response. Specific topics include firewalls, spam filters, intrusion detection systems, and risk management. Students will learn about protocols to communicate securely over unsecure networks, and about modern technologies for protecting computers from a wide range of threats. Throughout the course, real world cases are discussed, and students will gain hands-on experience in labs.

These threads are tied together by our semester-long project that enables you to relate your studies directly to your community. Everyone will select a study area your hometown, your current location, or another area with which you are familiar and conduct a mini Natural Resources Inventory of the area as related to each of the four natural spheres. You will identify natural resources such as climate, waterways, land cover (forests, grasslands, etc.), and geologic hazards (sinkholes, landslides, volcanoes, etc.) specific to your study area. Then, you will assess the quality of the air and water, any degradation to the land cover, and any negative effects of geologic hazards.

Borne out of imperial rivalries and complex European alliances, the war erupted suddenly in 1914 and ended more than four years later, at the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month. In the years between, the Allied and Central Powers engaged in a horrific and devastating  Total War,  drafting unprecedentedly large armies and transforming their economies to support the war effort, yet producing little more than stalemate and death on much of the Western Front. The Great War changed how wars were fought and introduced new technology to the battlefield. Students in this course will examine the origins and consequences of the war, the major strategic decisions, as well as the intertwining history on the home front of the combatant nations. Students will engage with the historical material through innovative games and simulations, designed to allow students to experience the major decision points and strategy during World War I as if they were really there. Along with the simulations, students will read primary source accounts of the war to understand the war s significance, its toll on the  Lost Generation,  and its ramifications more than one hundred years later.

By the end of the course, you will have mastered the understanding that it is not so much what you know, but how skillfully you think!\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\nCredit Hours\nSyllabus\n\n\nNone\n3 hours\nView Sample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerm Dates\nTerm & Duration\nEmpty\n\n\n\nSeptember 1, 2025 to October 26, 2025\nFall I - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nOctober 27, 2025 to December 21, 2025\nFall II - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 5, 2026 to March 1, 2026\nSpring I - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nMarch 2, 2026 to April 26, 2026\nSpring II - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nMay 4, 2026 to June 28, 2026\nSummer I - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nJune 29, 2026 to August 23, 2026\nSummer II - 8 week\n\n\n\nRegister\nAdmitted and Enrolled Students\nIf you're enrolled in a degree program at Excelsior, you need your academic advisor's approval before registering for courses.\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\n\nNon-matriculated and Visiting Students\nIf you're a non-matriculated student, you can register anytime.\nREGISTER\nHUM321\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI Feel Your Pain: Illness and Empathy in the Arts    Upper, 3 cr.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription \nThis course explores what happens when people become ill and how their experience of the care they receive from medical practitioners can affect and change their lives, for better or for worse. We look at current Western practices surrounding end-of-life care, the processing and acknowledgment of grief, and the tendency to deny our very mortality. We witness what people in stigmatized groups undergo when they seek medical treatment. And we confront what happens when a person, either ill or well, decides to end their life on their own terms. Throughout all of these explorations, we examine why empathy is crucial to both giving and receiving good care and how exposing ourselves to the arts can help foster empathy skills in those of us who live with, care for, and support the ill and dying.\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\nCredit Hours\nSyllabus\n\n\nNone\n3 hours\nView Sample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerm Dates\nTerm & Duration\nEmpty\n\n\n\nSeptember 1, 2025 to October 26, 2025\nFall I - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nOctober 27, 2025 to December 21, 2025\nFall II - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 5, 2026 to March 1, 2026\nSpring I - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nMarch 2, 2026 to April 26, 2026\nSpring II - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nMay 4, 2026 to June 28, 2026\nSummer I - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nJune 29, 2026 to August 23, 2026\nSummer II - 8 week\n\n\n\nRegister\nAdmitted and Enrolled Students\nIf you're enrolled in a degree program at Excelsior, you need your academic advisor's approval before registering for courses.\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\n\nNon-matriculated and Visiting Students\nIf you're a non-matriculated student, you can register anytime.\nREGISTER\nHUM321\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI Feel Your Pain: Illness and Empathy in the Arts    Upper, 3 cr.\nDescription \nThis course explores what happens when people become ill and how their experience of the care they receive from medical practitioners can affect and change their lives, for better or for worse.

You will apply basic principles of physics to the analysis of systems experiencing some combination of forces and torques, with an eye toward engineering applications. Statics deals with two and three-dimensional systems of particles and rigid bodies in static equilibrium. In a general sense, each principle is applied first to a particle, then to a rigid body subjected to a coplanar system of forces, and finally, to three-dimensional force systems acting on a rigid body. Special attention devoted to forces in structures such as truss, frames, and machines. After building a fundamental understanding of these topics, we will explore analysis of internal forces developed in structural members. Vector algebra will be used throughout. The subject is called statics because it is concerned with particles and rigid bodies that are in equilibrium; these will usually be stationary (i.e. static).\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\nCredit Hours\nSyllabus\n\n\nEGR280 Introduction to 3-D Modeling, and PHYS201 Physics I, and PHYS202 Physics I Laboratory,  MAT120 Precalculus, and MAT220 Calculus I, and MAT221 Calculus II\n3 hours\nView Sample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerm Dates\nTerm & Duration\nEmpty\n\n\n\nSeptember 1, 2025 to October 26, 2025\nFall I - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nMay 4, 2026 to June 28, 2026\nSummer I - 8 week\n\n\n\nRegister\nAdmitted and Enrolled Students\nIf you're enrolled in a degree program at Excelsior, you need your academic advisor's approval before registering for courses.\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\n\nNon-matriculated and Visiting Students\nIf you're a non-matriculated student, you can register anytime.\nREGISTER\nMET220\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStatics    Lower, 3 cr.\nDescription \nThis course introduces engineering mechanics in static systems.

The course includes laboratory work using a Generic Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) simulator. This simulator provides hands-on experience with the circulating water system, steam generator heat balance, main and reheat systems, overall plant efficiency, flux distribution, decay heat production, and load rejection. Based on a real operating unit, this web-based simulator is thoroughly tested and verified to perform plant maneuvers realistically and accurately. By the end of the course, students are able to analyze thermodynamic processes in closed and open systems to identify the optimal or most efficient use of energy resources. Note, the PWR simulator utilizes specific technologies that may present accessibility challenges for individuals with disabilities. Accessibility inquiries can be directed to the department chair. \n\n\n\nPrerequisites\nCredit Hours\nSyllabus\n\n\nMAT120 Precalculus\n3 hours\nView Sample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerm Dates\nTerm & Duration\nEmpty\n\n\n\nSeptember 1, 2025 to October 26, 2025\nFall I - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nMarch 2, 2026 to April 26, 2026\nSpring II - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nJune 29, 2026 to August 23, 2026\nSummer II - 8 week\n\n\n\nRegister\nAdmitted and Enrolled Students\nIf you're enrolled in a degree program at Excelsior, you need your academic advisor's approval before registering for courses.\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\n\nNon-matriculated and Visiting Students\nIf you're a non-matriculated student, you can register anytime.\nREGISTER\nNUC245\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThermodynamics    Lower, 3 cr.\nDescription \nThis course provides an understanding of thermodynamic and fluid flow principles, emphasizing their application to systems, particularly in nuclear power plant operations.

When you fill up your tank, have you ever wondered where the fuel comes from or what it takes to make this necessary energy source so readily available?  When you hear about costly wars or domestic strife in energy-rich regions like Russia or the Middle East, do you question how these might be related?  Beyond the near constant power rivalry over energy, even alternative energy technologies, global climate change looms as an almost incalculable cost.  In this course you develop a geopolitical lens onto energy and climate change by looking at powerful state, military and corporate actors, each pursuing its own, often conflicting, objectives.  You examine how these actors influence energy geopolitics and climate change, such as in dealing with the security implications of increased sea levels, storm intensities, Arctic melt and drought.  In this course you examine the political realities of energy today and the possibilities of different tomorrows.\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\nCredit Hours\nSyllabus\n\n\nNone\n3 hours\nView Sample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerm Dates\nTerm & Duration\nEmpty\n\n\n\nOctober 27, 2025 to December 21, 2025\nFall II - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nMarch 2, 2026 to April 26, 2026\nSpring II - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nJune 29, 2026 to August 23, 2026\nSummer II - 8 week\n\n\n\nRegister\nAdmitted and Enrolled Students\nIf you're enrolled in a degree program at Excelsior, you need your academic advisor's approval before registering for courses.\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\n\nNon-matriculated and Visiting Students\nIf you're a non-matriculated student, you can register anytime.\nREGISTER\nPOL320\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Geopolitics of Energy and Global Climate Change    Upper, 3 cr.\nDescription \nEnergy consumption is the lifeblood of the US and global economy, yet we seldom investigate the costs involved in making a gallon of gas cheaper than a gallon of milk.

In this course, students will learn how to develop Excel statistical and decision models and create basic data visualizations, which will help students become data savvy and provide them with essential Excel skills, both of which are necessary to be competitive in a professional work environment. It will include a review of important statistical methods; use of time series for forecasting; application of regression analysis; aspects of decision theory including model building, linear optimization, simulation, optimization with and without risk and uncertainty; and methods to effectively communicate the results and rationales to management in tables and using graphs. The course also includes use of Tableau to create more effective data visualizations and data stories.

Distributed workforces use a variety of telecommunication networks and tools to establish connectivity as well as provide organizational policies and procedures, email​, and interactive meetings. Distributed teams encompass organizations that (1) offer flexible work arrangements and whose employees work out of home offices rather than on-site​; and (2) have employees who are geographically distant. Employers have acknowledged that managing distributed employees is different than managing employees on-site, noting ​that it is difficult to keep employees engaged and connected. Thus, distributed workplaces have created challenges to organizational behavior. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics has reported that the need for managers who know how to manage distributed employees is growing at a faster-than-average rate. Research has suggested that when strategically planned and implemented, distributed work programs increase productivity, increase job satisfaction, increase loyalty, ease work-life integration​, and reduce employee stress and burnout. This course will offer management and leadership strategies that will contribute to the success of organizations, including distributed organizations. You will discover how individual differences impact organizations, learn how to apply management and leadership skills to specific situations, apply proper business ethics, and examine how culture plays a role in today s global business world.\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\nCredit Hours\nSyllabus\n\n\nNone\n3 hours\nView Sample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerm Dates\nTerm & Duration\nEmpty\n\n\n\nSeptember 1, 2025 to October 26, 2025\nFall I - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nOctober 27, 2025 to December 21, 2025\nFall II - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 5, 2026 to March 1, 2026\nSpring I - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nMarch 2, 2026 to April 26, 2026\nSpring II - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nMay 4, 2026 to June 28, 2026\nSummer I - 8 week\n\n\n\nRegister\nAdmitted and Enrolled Students\nIf you're enrolled in a degree program at Excelsior, you need your academic advisor's approval before registering for courses.\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\n\nNon-matriculated and Visiting Students\nIf you're a non-matriculated student, you can register anytime.\nREGISTER\nBUS553\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOrganizational Behavior    Grad, 3 cr.\nDescription \nDuring the last two years​, ​the world has seen unprecedented growth in distributed employees as a consequence of COVID-19.

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics has reported that the need for managers who know how to manage distributed employees is growing at a faster-than-average rate. Research has suggested that when strategically planned and implemented, distributed work programs increase productivity, increase job satisfaction, increase loyalty, ease work-life integration​, and reduce employee stress and burnout. This course will offer management and leadership strategies that will contribute to the success of organizations, including distributed organizations. You will discover how individual differences impact organizations, learn how to apply management and leadership skills to specific situations, apply proper business ethics, and examine how culture plays a role in today s global business world.\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\nCredit Hours\nSyllabus\n\n\nNone\n3 hours\nView Sample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerm Dates\nTerm & Duration\nEmpty\n\n\n\nSeptember 1, 2025 to October 26, 2025\nFall I - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nOctober 27, 2025 to December 21, 2025\nFall II - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 5, 2026 to March 1, 2026\nSpring I - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nMarch 2, 2026 to April 26, 2026\nSpring II - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nMay 4, 2026 to June 28, 2026\nSummer I - 8 week\n\n\n\nRegister\nAdmitted and Enrolled Students\nIf you're enrolled in a degree program at Excelsior, you need your academic advisor's approval before registering for courses.\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\n\nNon-matriculated and Visiting Students\nIf you're a non-matriculated student, you can register anytime.\nREGISTER\nBUS554\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChange Management    Grad, 3 cr.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription \nThis course is a study of the process of change and change management that focuses on the necessity of change in today's globally competitive environment, the type and manner of change taking place within organizations, and identifying the key challenges and opportunities associated with each type of change.

Training protects employees from work-related injuries, but also improves productivity, performance, and morale. In addition, training in equal employment opportunity, including sexual harassment and race discrimination, is also required by law. In 2020 the world has seen an unprecedented growth in distributed employees as a consequence of COVID-19. Distributed workforces use a variety of telecommunication networks and tools to establish connectivity as well as provide organizational policies and procedures, email and interactive meetings. Distributed teams encompass organizations that (1) offer flexible work arrangements and whose employees work out of home offices rather than on site and (2) have employees who are geographically distant. This course will provide an overview of facilitating training programs in a virtual environment. We will address adult learning principles involved in the design of virtual training, strategies for engaging employees during training, the use of training methods for synchronous and asynchronous learning, and ways to assess the effectiveness of the training program.\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\nCredit Hours\nSyllabus\n\n\nNone\n3 hours\nView Sample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerm Dates\nTerm & Duration\nEmpty\n\n\n\nOctober 27, 2025 to December 21, 2025\nFall II - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nMarch 2, 2026 to April 26, 2026\nSpring II - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nJune 29, 2026 to August 23, 2026\nSummer II - 8 week\n\n\n\nRegister\nAdmitted and Enrolled Students\nIf you're enrolled in a degree program at Excelsior, you need your academic advisor's approval before registering for courses.\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\n\nNon-matriculated and Visiting Students\nIf you're a non-matriculated student, you can register anytime.\nREGISTER\nBUS561\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVirtual Training and Development    Grad, 3 cr.\nDescription \nResearch has indicated that employee training is important in an organization because it allows employees to improve their skills and improve the quality of work they are providing to the organization.

We will examine the foundations of information systems security as defined by industry experts and the International Information Systems Security Certification Consortium, or (ISC)2 , which is considered a definitive source for information security domain definitions and a premier certification authority. As such, this course will examine information systems security concepts according to the consortium s newly redesigned \"eight domains of knowledge\" model for their Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) certification. We will use course textbooks, open educational resources, current cybersecurity events, research and case studies to support our lectures, discussions and assessments. We will learn to apply some of the information systems security knowledge and skills through individual activities and practice exams. The course will provide you with an opportunity to apply the course subjects to a project that encompasses several of the major topics.

How about negative interest rates? Macroeconomists consider interest rates and other economic  variables  because interest rates affect activities like hiring and firing of workers (employment) across a whole economy and even worldwide. You might care about interest rates because these affect borrowing costs. Interest rates also affect home and rental pricing and changes in pay on a yearly basis. In this course you will learn how economists measure and forecast economic factors like those mentioned here to assist state, local and federal governments in maintaining services to citizens, price stability and the broadest level of employment possible.

Macroeconomists consider interest rates and other economic  variables  because interest rates affect activities like hiring and firing of workers (employment) across a whole economy and even worldwide. You might care about interest rates because these affect borrowing costs. Interest rates also affect home and rental pricing and changes in pay on a yearly basis. In this course you will learn how economists measure and forecast economic factors like those mentioned here to assist state, local and federal governments in maintaining services to citizens, price stability and the broadest level of employment possible. You will also learn how powerfully macroeconomic factors affect you directly.\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\nCredit Hours\nSyllabus\n\n\nNone\n3 hours\nView Sample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerm Dates\nTerm & Duration\nEmpty\n\n\n\nSeptember 1, 2025 to October 26, 2025\nFall I - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nOctober 27, 2025 to December 21, 2025\nFall II - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nMarch 2, 2026 to April 26, 2026\nSpring II - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nJune 29, 2026 to August 23, 2026\nSummer II - 8 week\n\n\n\nRegister\nAdmitted and Enrolled Students\nIf you're enrolled in a degree program at Excelsior, you need your academic advisor's approval before registering for courses.\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\n\nNon-matriculated and Visiting Students\nIf you're a non-matriculated student, you can register anytime.\nREGISTER\nELEC152\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCircuit Theory I    Lower, 4 cr.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription \nThis course provides an introduction to the various principles of electrical circuit analysis.

You will apply basic principles, tools, and methods while performing engineering analyses of mechanics, electrical circuits, thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and finally, data analysis, including graphing and basic statistics. The general analysis procedure will be learned and applied to provide a basis of systematically approaching engineering applications and analyses. Additionally, the disciplined process of evaluating engineering situations, defining known and unknown variables, establishing equation-based approaches, and applying units and unit conversions will be utilized to develop the foundation for effective engineering analyses. Finally, methods and processes for using engineering data and developing effective analysis and communication tools, such as graphs and statistical analyses, are explored to develop the foundation for communicating to engineering and non-engineering reviewers.

Our course has three threads: Earth, as represented by the four natural spheres atmosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere. Each of these spheres is addressed individually in modules in the course. Society, as represented through the effects of Earth processes on humans and society and the effects of the human existence on the physical nature of the Earth. Technology, which has greatly expanded in geoscience research. You will use these technologies in researching information related to your final project. These threads are tied together by our semester-long project that enables you to relate your studies directly to your community. Everyone will select a study area your hometown, your current location, or another area with which you are familiar and conduct a mini Natural Resources Inventory of the area as related to each of the four natural spheres. You will identify natural resources such as climate, waterways, land cover (forests, grasslands, etc.), and geologic hazards (sinkholes, landslides, volcanoes, etc.) specific to your study area. Then, you will assess the quality of the air and water, any degradation to the land cover, and any negative effects of geologic hazards.

Our course has three threads: Earth, as represented by the four natural spheres atmosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere. Each of these spheres is addressed individually in modules in the course. Society, as represented through the effects of Earth processes on humans and society and the effects of the human existence on the physical nature of the Earth. Technology, which has greatly expanded in geoscience research. You will use these technologies in researching information related to your final project. These threads are tied together by our semester-long project that enables you to relate your studies directly to your community. Everyone will select a study area your hometown, your current location, or another area with which you are familiar and conduct a mini Natural Resources Inventory of the area as related to each of the four natural spheres. You will identify natural resources such as climate, waterways, land cover (forests, grasslands, etc.), and geologic hazards (sinkholes, landslides, volcanoes, etc.) specific to your study area. Then, you will assess the quality of the air and water, any degradation to the land cover, and any negative effects of geologic hazards.

Borne out of imperial rivalries and complex European alliances, the war erupted suddenly in 1914 and ended more than four years later, at the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month. In the years between, the Allied and Central Powers engaged in a horrific and devastating  Total War,  drafting unprecedentedly large armies and transforming their economies to support the war effort, yet producing little more than stalemate and death on much of the Western Front. The Great War changed how wars were fought and introduced new technology to the battlefield. Students in this course will examine the origins and consequences of the war, the major strategic decisions, as well as the intertwining history on the home front of the combatant nations. Students will engage with the historical material through innovative games and simulations, designed to allow students to experience the major decision points and strategy during World War I as if they were really there. Along with the simulations, students will read primary source accounts of the war to understand the war s significance, its toll on the  Lost Generation,  and its ramifications more than one hundred years later.

Finally, students will analyze past and current regulations of intelligence gathering, as well as the rules governing intelligence gathering by law enforcers, military and non-law enforcement organizations, and the implications this has on the privacy rights of individuals, citizens or otherwise, in the context of counterterrorism.  This course will examine these and other relevant issues which impact American counterterrorism operations. \n\n\n\nPrerequisites\nCredit Hours\nSyllabus\n\n\nNone\n3 hours\nView Sample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerm Dates\nTerm & Duration\nEmpty\n\n\n\nOctober 27, 2025 to December 21, 2025\nFall II - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nMarch 2, 2026 to April 26, 2026\nSpring II - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nJune 29, 2026 to August 23, 2026\nSummer II - 8 week\n\n\n\nRegister\nAdmitted and Enrolled Students\nIf you're enrolled in a degree program at Excelsior, you need your academic advisor's approval before registering for courses.\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\n\nNon-matriculated and Visiting Students\nIf you're a non-matriculated student, you can register anytime.\nREGISTER\nHEM460\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInfrastructure Security and Policy    Upper, 3 cr.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription \nThis course covers infrastructure security and policies.

By the end of the course, you will have mastered the understanding that it is not so much what you know, but how skillfully you think!\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\nCredit Hours\nSyllabus\n\n\nNone\n3 hours\nView Sample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerm Dates\nTerm & Duration\nEmpty\n\n\n\nSeptember 1, 2025 to October 26, 2025\nFall I - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nOctober 27, 2025 to December 21, 2025\nFall II - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 5, 2026 to March 1, 2026\nSpring I - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nMarch 2, 2026 to April 26, 2026\nSpring II - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nMay 4, 2026 to June 28, 2026\nSummer I - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nJune 29, 2026 to August 23, 2026\nSummer II - 8 week\n\n\n\nRegister\nAdmitted and Enrolled Students\nIf you're enrolled in a degree program at Excelsior, you need your academic advisor's approval before registering for courses.\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\n\nNon-matriculated and Visiting Students\nIf you're a non-matriculated student, you can register anytime.\nREGISTER\nHUM321\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI Feel Your Pain: Illness and Empathy in the Arts    Upper, 3 cr.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription \nThis course explores what happens when people become ill and how their experience of the care they receive from medical practitioners can affect and change their lives, for better or for worse. We look at current Western practices surrounding end-of-life care, the processing and acknowledgment of grief, and the tendency to deny our very mortality. We witness what people in stigmatized groups undergo when they seek medical treatment. And we confront what happens when a person, either ill or well, decides to end their life on their own terms. Throughout all of these explorations, we examine why empathy is crucial to both giving and receiving good care and how exposing ourselves to the arts can help foster empathy skills in those of us who live with, care for, and support the ill and dying.\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\nCredit Hours\nSyllabus\n\n\nNone\n3 hours\nView Sample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerm Dates\nTerm & Duration\nEmpty\n\n\n\nSeptember 1, 2025 to October 26, 2025\nFall I - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nOctober 27, 2025 to December 21, 2025\nFall II - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 5, 2026 to March 1, 2026\nSpring I - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nMarch 2, 2026 to April 26, 2026\nSpring II - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nMay 4, 2026 to June 28, 2026\nSummer I - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nJune 29, 2026 to August 23, 2026\nSummer II - 8 week\n\n\n\nRegister\nAdmitted and Enrolled Students\nIf you're enrolled in a degree program at Excelsior, you need your academic advisor's approval before registering for courses.\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\n\nNon-matriculated and Visiting Students\nIf you're a non-matriculated student, you can register anytime.\nREGISTER\nHUM321\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI Feel Your Pain: Illness and Empathy in the Arts    Upper, 3 cr.\nDescription \nThis course explores what happens when people become ill and how their experience of the care they receive from medical practitioners can affect and change their lives, for better or for worse.

You will apply basic principles of physics to the analysis of systems experiencing some combination of forces and torques, with an eye toward engineering applications. Statics deals with two and three-dimensional systems of particles and rigid bodies in static equilibrium. In a general sense, each principle is applied first to a particle, then to a rigid body subjected to a coplanar system of forces, and finally, to three-dimensional force systems acting on a rigid body. Special attention devoted to forces in structures such as truss, frames, and machines. After building a fundamental understanding of these topics, we will explore analysis of internal forces developed in structural members. Vector algebra will be used throughout. The subject is called statics because it is concerned with particles and rigid bodies that are in equilibrium; these will usually be stationary (i.e. static).\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\nCredit Hours\nSyllabus\n\n\nEGR280 Introduction to 3-D Modeling, and PHYS201 Physics I, and PHYS202 Physics I Laboratory,  MAT120 Precalculus, and MAT220 Calculus I, and MAT221 Calculus II\n3 hours\nView Sample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerm Dates\nTerm & Duration\nEmpty\n\n\n\nSeptember 1, 2025 to October 26, 2025\nFall I - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nMay 4, 2026 to June 28, 2026\nSummer I - 8 week\n\n\n\nRegister\nAdmitted and Enrolled Students\nIf you're enrolled in a degree program at Excelsior, you need your academic advisor's approval before registering for courses.\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\n\nNon-matriculated and Visiting Students\nIf you're a non-matriculated student, you can register anytime.\nREGISTER\nMET220\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStatics    Lower, 3 cr.\nDescription \nThis course introduces engineering mechanics in static systems.

The course includes laboratory work using a Generic Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) simulator. This simulator provides hands-on experience with the circulating water system, steam generator heat balance, main and reheat systems, overall plant efficiency, flux distribution, decay heat production, and load rejection. Based on a real operating unit, this web-based simulator is thoroughly tested and verified to perform plant maneuvers realistically and accurately. By the end of the course, students are able to analyze thermodynamic processes in closed and open systems to identify the optimal or most efficient use of energy resources. Note, the PWR simulator utilizes specific technologies that may present accessibility challenges for individuals with disabilities. Accessibility inquiries can be directed to the department chair. \n\n\n\nPrerequisites\nCredit Hours\nSyllabus\n\n\nMAT120 Precalculus\n3 hours\nView Sample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerm Dates\nTerm & Duration\nEmpty\n\n\n\nSeptember 1, 2025 to October 26, 2025\nFall I - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nMarch 2, 2026 to April 26, 2026\nSpring II - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nJune 29, 2026 to August 23, 2026\nSummer II - 8 week\n\n\n\nRegister\nAdmitted and Enrolled Students\nIf you're enrolled in a degree program at Excelsior, you need your academic advisor's approval before registering for courses.\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\n\nNon-matriculated and Visiting Students\nIf you're a non-matriculated student, you can register anytime.\nREGISTER\nNUC245\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThermodynamics    Lower, 3 cr.\nDescription \nThis course provides an understanding of thermodynamic and fluid flow principles, emphasizing their application to systems, particularly in nuclear power plant operations.

When you fill up your tank, have you ever wondered where the fuel comes from or what it takes to make this necessary energy source so readily available?  When you hear about costly wars or domestic strife in energy-rich regions like Russia or the Middle East, do you question how these might be related?  Beyond the near constant power rivalry over energy, even alternative energy technologies, global climate change looms as an almost incalculable cost.  In this course you develop a geopolitical lens onto energy and climate change by looking at powerful state, military and corporate actors, each pursuing its own, often conflicting, objectives.  You examine how these actors influence energy geopolitics and climate change, such as in dealing with the security implications of increased sea levels, storm intensities, Arctic melt and drought.  In this course you examine the political realities of energy today and the possibilities of different tomorrows.\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\nCredit Hours\nSyllabus\n\n\nNone\n3 hours\nView Sample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerm Dates\nTerm & Duration\nEmpty\n\n\n\nOctober 27, 2025 to December 21, 2025\nFall II - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nMarch 2, 2026 to April 26, 2026\nSpring II - 8 week\n\n\n\n\nJune 29, 2026 to August 23, 2026\nSummer II - 8 week\n\n\n\nRegister\nAdmitted and Enrolled Students\nIf you're enrolled in a degree program at Excelsior, you need your academic advisor's approval before registering for courses.\nREGISTER IN MAPLANNER\n\nNon-matriculated and Visiting Students\nIf you're a non-matriculated student, you can register anytime.\nREGISTER\nPOL320\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Geopolitics of Energy and Global Climate Change    Upper, 3 cr.\nDescription \nEnergy consumption is the lifeblood of the US and global economy, yet we seldom investigate the costs involved in making a gallon of gas cheaper than a gallon of milk.

      "content": "[HEADING] Admissions FAQs\n[HEADING] See responses to frequently asked questions about the admissions process below\nWhen can I apply?\nOur application for admission opens September 1 for the following calendar year (for example, September 1, 2024 for the January, May, and August 2025 intakes).  If you would like to ensure you are notified when our application opens, we encourage you to submit our Application Request for Information form.\nI am currently pursuing my bachelor's degree. Can I still apply by the \"priority\" deadline?\nApplicants who are currently pursuing their bachelor's degree are encouraged to apply by the regular deadline (January 10) so your fall (or seventh) semester grades are included on your official transcript/evaluation report.\nWhat do I need to submit for admissions consideration?\nRequired application materials vary by program and applicant type (domestic or international).\nIn general, to apply for admission to our Master’s programs, prospective students are required to submit an online application form, undergraduate transcripts, their professional resume, two recommendations, and an essay.\nWhat is the application fee? Is it possible to get an application fee waiver?\nThere is no application fee to apply to Heinz College.\nCan I apply to more than one program?\nWe strongly recommend applicants apply to one program. Students interested in more than one of our programs are encouraged to apply to their top choice and can indicate their interest in a second program at Heinz within their “Optional” essay within their application.\nCan I still apply if I missed the application deadline?\nWe do accept late applications to our master’s programs. However, we review all applications that were received by our deadline first, and we cannot guarantee that there will be space left in the program after our initial round of application review has been completed. Please submit your application online and be sure all supporting materials are in transit to us by the application deadline to have the best chance for admission and scholarship/ fellowship support.\nWe do not accept applications after the deadline for the Ph.D. programs.\nCan I defer my admission?\nWe strongly encourage applicants to apply for entry for the year (for full-time) or semester (for part-time) in which they intend to enroll. Deferrals are not common and are considered on a case-by-case basis for one academic year only. Typically, deferrals are granted for military/volunteer public service or opportunities with one of our partner organizations.\nTechnical issues with the application?\nIf you are having technical issues with the application, please contact the Heinz College Office of Admissions.\nWhat is my current application status?\nYou can find the latest, most up-to-date information on your application status via your online portal.\nCan I apply to two different programs or two different tracks within the same program?\nContact the Office of Admissions before starting a second application for CMU's Heinz College in the same year. Our admissions process tends to favor students who have clear goals for their graduate study. Submitting more than one application in the same year may serve to reduce the strength of both applications.\nIf you are interested in more than one program of study, we encourage you to apply to your first choice program (or pathway). In your application, you may mention alternate programs/pathways that interest you in an optional essay. Note: If an applicant is not admitted to the program/pathway to which they applied, they may automatically be considered for alternate programs/pathways that are a better fit at Heinz College - even if the applicant did not mention alternate interests in the optional essay.\nCan you review my application if some of my materials arrive late?\nWe will not be able to review your application until all materials are received and processed. Please be sure to submit all required materials as described in the online application instructions.\nAre GRE/GMAT scores required in order to apply for admission to graduate programs at Heinz College?\nThe GRE/GMAT is required for admission to most of the master's and Ph.D. programs offered by Heinz College. Each program, however, has its own policy. In some cases, applicants may be able to qualify for a waiver of the test score requirement and apply without test scores. Please select your program of interest from the list below to learn more about your program's GRE/GMAT testing policy:\nWhat are Heinz College’s GRE codes?\nThe institution code is 3085. Please select any department code for the department. Heinz College will be able to access the GRE codes from any listed department codes.\nI sent my GRE score to the previous GRE code. Do I need to resend the scores?\nIf you already sent GRE scores to the “main” Carnegie Mellon University code (2074 Carnegie Mellon U – any department) they will still be verified – you do not need to submit another score to the 3085 code. Scores sent to the 3085 Carnegie Mellon U Heinz Coll code may be processed more quickly.\nHow old can GRE test scores be?\nWe will accept test scores that are up to five years old at the time of application. If you are coming up on the five year mark, please send us the score report as soon as possible. ETS will not verify test scores beyond the five year mark.\nCan I take the GRE/GMAT after the application deadline?\nOn the application, enter your upcoming test date and registration number (if available) in lieu of your scores. Be sure to still submit your application prior to the posted deadline.\nPlease also ask the testing service to report your official scores to us electronically after you complete the exam to ensure the quickest verification possible.\nDid you receive my test scores?\nCan I change a recommender?\nYes – you may update your recommender(s) using the “Recommenders” page of the online application for any recommender to exclude any recommender and add someone else in their place.\nIf you you have already submitted your online application, you may re-notify any of your recommenders by logging into your application status page. Follow the instructions just below your checklist to resend notification emails to your recommenders - you can also exclude recommenders from this page. Note that if you exclude any recommenders, they will not be counted towards the requirement of having at least 2 recommendations submitted in support of your application.\nIf the recommender has concerns about what they submitted, please ask that person to contact the Admissions Office (hnzadmit@andrew.cmu.edu) directly.\nShould I waive my right to view my recommendations?\nThis is entirely your decision, although some recommenders may have a preference on how you respond. Heinz College has no preference regarding your response.\nUnder the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA), students have access to their education record, including letters of recommendation submitted for their application. However, students may waive their right to see letters of evaluation, in which case the letters will be held in confidence. The way that you respond to the \"FERPA Waiver\" question will not impact your chances for admission in any way.\nCan I change how I answered the recommendation \"waiver\" question for one or more of my recommenders? Can you change my response for me?\nYou cannot change your response to the question about waiving your right to access a recommendation after you have registered a recommender in our application system. We cannot change your response for you.\nThe way that you responded to the \"FERPA Waiver\" question will not harm your chances for admission in any way.  It is the right of every applicant to retain – or waive – their rights to view their recommendation letters as part of their student record if they are admitted and later enroll at CMU’s Heinz College.\nDo I need to take the TOEFL exam?\nIf your native language (mother tongue) is not English, you are required to submit an official score report from TOEFL, IELTS or Duolingo.

Heinz College will use the highest score verified in each section if you have taken the exam more than one time. For every score you want to include with your application, you must report the exam date(s) and submit the official score report(s). We will not accept exam scores for test dates that are not listed on the application. If you took any of these tests more than two years ago, you MUST take it again. The testing agency will not verify scores more than two years old.\nFor my undergraduate degree, I attended an institution located in the U.S. for less than four years, but I earned by bachelor’s degree from a school in the U.S. Can the TOEFL/IELTS/Duolingo requirement be waived for me?\nPer our posted TOEFL/IELTS/Duolingo policy, earning a previous degree at an institution where English is the main language of instruction does not qualify an applicant for a waiver of this requirement unless that student spent 4 or more years in the United States earning their degree.\nIf you submitted TOEFL/IELTS/Duolingo results when you applied to your undergraduate university, we would accept those scores as official if sent to us directly from an administrator at your school.\nFor more information on how to submit those scores, please contact the Admissions Office (hnzadmit@andrew.cmu.edu) directly.\nHow do I submit my Duolingo scores?\nThere is not a code for Duolingo. You must send your Duolingo scores directly to “Carnegie Mellon University – Heinz College of Information Systems & Public Policy” from Duolingo.\nWhat is Heinz’s TOEFL code? / I’m using the 2176 TOEFL code but TOEFL has this code listed as the Undergraduate Department.\nThe institution code is 2176.

Students interested in more than one of our programs are encouraged to apply to their top choice and can indicate their interest in a second program at Heinz within their “Optional” essay within their application. Am I allowed to use ChatGPT or other AI tools to structure my essay and improve language? Carnegie Mellon has always been a first mover in the AI space and remains deeply engaged in shaping the future of AI technologies and their uses. As we continue to learn about these tools and lean into their opportunities, we also want to address their challenges. Carnegie Mellon wants to know applicants as individuals, and submitting genuine, authentic application materials can make a significant difference. AI should never replace your unique voice, experiences and personal expression.Your essay should contain only true information and your own, original content. You should not use artificial intelligence (AI), such as ChatGPT, to write any portion of your essay. If you include a quote or text written by any other person or published in any printed or online format, you must surround the copied text in quotation marks (\") and indicate the original source of the text. Information reported on your résumé is subject to verification. Heinz College's Office of Admissions utilizes several methods to identify plagiarized, AI-generated, and falsified content in uploaded documents. Submission of false, plagiarized or AI-generated material as part of the application for admission may result in automatic denial of admission to any degree program. Can I still apply if I missed the application deadline?We do accept late applications to our master’s programs.

As we continue to learn about these tools and lean into their opportunities, we also want to address their challenges. Carnegie Mellon wants to know applicants as individuals, and submitting genuine, authentic application materials can make a significant difference. AI should never replace your unique voice, experiences and personal expression.Your essay should contain only true information and your own, original content. You should not use artificial intelligence (AI), such as ChatGPT, to write any portion of your essay. If you include a quote or text written by any other person or published in any printed or online format, you must surround the copied text in quotation marks (\") and indicate the original source of the text. Information reported on your résumé is subject to verification. Heinz College's Office of Admissions utilizes several methods to identify plagiarized, AI-generated, and falsified content in uploaded documents. Submission of false, plagiarized or AI-generated material as part of the application for admission may result in automatic denial of admission to any degree program. Can I still apply if I missed the application deadline?We do accept late applications to our master’s programs. However, we review all applications that were received by our deadline first, and we cannot guarantee that there will be space left in the program after our initial round of application review has been completed. Please submit your application online and be sure all supporting materials are in transit to us by the application deadline to have the best chance for admission and scholarship/ fellowship support.We do not accept applications after the deadline for the Ph.D. programs.  Can I defer my admission?We strongly encourage applicants to apply for entry for the year (for full-time) or semester (for part-time) in which they intend to enroll. Deferrals are not common and are considered on a case-by-case basis for one academic year only. Typically, deferrals are granted for military/volunteer public service or opportunities with one of our partner organizations.\nOnline Application\n            \n\n\n\nTechnical issues with the application?If you are having technical issues with the application, please contact the Heinz College Office of Admissions. What is my current application status?You can find the latest, most up-to-date information on your application status via your online portal. Can I apply to two different programs or two different tracks within the same program?Contact the Office of Admissions before starting a second application for CMU's Heinz College in the same year. Our admissions process tends to favor students who have clear goals for their graduate study. Submitting more than one application in the same year may serve to reduce the strength of both applications.If you are interested in more than one program of study, we encourage you to apply to your first choice program (or pathway). In your application, you may mention alternate programs/pathways that interest you in an optional essay. Note: If an applicant is not admitted to the program/pathway to which they applied, they may automatically be considered for alternate programs/pathways that are a better fit at Heinz College - even if the applicant did not mention alternate interests in the optional essay. Can you review my application if some of my materials arrive late?We will not be able to review your application until all materials are received and processed. Please be sure to submit all required materials as described in the online application instructions.\nGRE/GMAT\n            \n\n\n\nAre GRE/GMAT scores required in order to apply for admission to graduate programs at Heinz College?The GRE/GMAT is required for admission to most of the master's and Ph.D. programs offered by Heinz College. Each program, however, has its own policy. In some cases, applicants may be able to qualify for a waiver of the test score requirement and apply without test scores. Please select your program of interest from the list below to learn more about your program's GRE/GMAT testing policy: Artificial Intelligence Systems ManagementArts ManagementEntertainment Industry ManagementHealth Care AnalyticsInformation Systems ManagementInformation Security Policy and ManagementInformation Technology Management (Online)Medical Management for PhysiciansPublic ManagementPublic Policy and ManagementPh.D. Programs What are Heinz College’s GRE codes?The institution code is 3085. Please select any department code for the department. Heinz College will be able to access the GRE codes from any listed department codes. I sent my GRE score to the previous GRE code. Do I need to resend the scores?If you already sent GRE scores to the “main” Carnegie Mellon University code (2074 Carnegie Mellon U – any department) they will still be verified – you do not need to submit another score to the 3085 code. Scores sent to the 3085 Carnegie Mellon U Heinz Coll code may be processed more quickly. How old can GRE test scores be?We will accept test scores that are up to five years old at the time of application. If you are coming up on the five year mark, please send us the score report as soon as possible. ETS will not verify test scores beyond the five year mark. Can I take the GRE/GMAT after the application deadline?On the application, enter your upcoming test date and registration number (if available) in lieu of your scores. Be sure to still submit your application prior to the posted deadline. Please also ask the testing service to report your official scores to us electronically after you complete the exam to ensure the quickest verification possible. Did you receive my test scores?You can find the latest, most up-to-date information on your application status via your online portal.\nRecommendations\n            \n\n\n\nCan I change a recommender?Yes – you may update your recommender(s) using the “Recommenders” page of the online application for any recommender to exclude any recommender and add someone else in their place.If you you have already submitted your online application, you may re-notify any of your recommenders by logging into your application status page. Follow the instructions just below your checklist to resend notification emails to your recommenders - you can also exclude recommenders from this page. Note that if you exclude any recommenders, they will not be counted towards the requirement of having at least 2 recommendations submitted in support of your application. If the recommender has concerns about what they submitted, please ask that person to contact the Admissions Office (hnzadmit@andrew.cmu.edu) directly. Should I waive my right to view my recommendations?This is entirely your decision, although some recommenders may have a preference on how you respond. Heinz College has no preference regarding your response. Under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA), students have access to their education record, including letters of recommendation submitted for their application. However, students may waive their right to see letters of evaluation, in which case the letters will be held in confidence. The way that you respond to the \"FERPA Waiver\" question will not impact your chances for admission in any way. Can I change how I answered the recommendation \"waiver\" question for one or more of my recommenders? Can you change my response for me?You cannot change your response to the question about waiving your right to access a recommendation after you have registered a recommender in our application system. We cannot change your response for you. The way that you responded to the \"FERPA Waiver\" question will not harm your chances for admission in any way.  It is the right of every applicant to retain – or waive – their rights to view their recommendation letters as part of their student record if they are admitted and later enroll at CMU’s Heinz College.\nTOEFL/IELTS\n            \n\n\n\nDo I need to take the TOEFL exam?If your native language (mother tongue) is not English, you are required to submit an official score report from TOEFL, IELTS or Duolingo. The only exceptions are for:applicants who have worked or studied for five or more years in Australia, Botswana, Canada, Eswatini (formerly Swaziland), Ghana, Ireland, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Namibia, New Zealand, Nigeria, Singapore, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, United Kingdom, United States, and/or Zambia.applicants who studied for 4 years of their undergrad education in the United States and earned their bachelor's degree from a regionally accredited US school (students are encouraged to provide unofficial copies of the English Language Proficiency exam they used when they applied to their undergraduate institution as part of their application to Heinz College).  The Admissions Committee requires all applicants to score at or above the posted minimums for the TOEFL/IELTS/Duolingo.  If your score falls below the posted minimum TOELF/IELTS/Duolingo score, we strongly encourage you to retake the exam. Can I submit scores from multiple TOEFL/IELTS/Duolingo exams?You may submit scores from up to 4 valid TOEFL, IELTS, or Duolingo exam dates. Heinz College will use the highest score verified in each section if you have taken the exam more than one time. For every score you want to include with your application, you must report the exam date(s) and submit the official score report(s). We will not accept exam scores for test dates that are not listed on the application. If you took any of these tests more than two years ago, you MUST take it again. The testing agency will not verify scores more than two years old. For my undergraduate degree, I attended an institution located in the U.S. for less than four years, but I earned by bachelor’s degree from a school in the U.S. Can the TOEFL/IELTS/Duolingo requirement be waived for me? Per our posted TOEFL/IELTS/Duolingo policy, earning a previous degree at an institution where English is the main language of instruction does not qualify an applicant for a waiver of this requirement unless that student spent 4 or more years in the United States earning their degree. If you submitted TOEFL/IELTS/Duolingo results when you applied to your undergraduate university, we would accept those scores as official if sent to us directly from an administrator at your school.For more information on how to submit those scores, please contact the Admissions Office (hnzadmit@andrew.cmu.edu) directly. How do I submit my Duolingo scores?There is not a code for Duolingo. You must send your Duolingo scores directly to “Carnegie Mellon University – Heinz College of Information Systems & Public Policy” from Duolingo. What is Heinz’s TOEFL code? / I’m using the 2176 TOEFL code but TOEFL has this code listed as the Undergraduate Department.The institution code is 2176. Please disregard any department label (including “Undergraduate”) that may be associated with that institution code. I sent my TOEFL scores to the CMU general code (2074). Do I need to resend the scores?Heinz College is able to verify TOEFL scores sent to the “main” CMU code (2074), so you do not need to pay for another score report.  However, scores sent to 2176 may be verified more quickly. How old can TOEFL test scores be?We will accept test scores that are up to two years old at the time of application. If you are coming up on the two year mark, please send us the score report as soon as possible. ETS will not verify test scores beyond the two year mark. Did you receive my test scores?You can find the latest, most up-to-date information on your application status via your online portal.\nTranscripts\n            \n\n\n\nYou will find a majority the answers to your transcript-related questions on the Transcripts page. Below are some additional, frequently asked questions. How can I submit my transcript?For instructions on how to submit your transcripts, please click on the applicable program below:Master of Medical Management for Physicians ProgramFull-Time Master's Programs (not including MMM)Ph.D Programs Is my GPA score good enough for admission?  Heinz College does not have a required minimum GPA.

As an enrolling student, you will be required to successfully complete a verification process of your admission application materials. The verification process will be completed by an outside, independent contractor hired by Heinz College and Carnegie Mellon University.\nThe purpose of this background check is to protect all stakeholders of the program (students, faculty, staff, and alumni) from those who would falsify their backgrounds to gain an unfair advantage in the admissions process. We believe that this verification will support our efforts to ensure integrity throughout the program. Upon admission, you will receive more details about this process from the Office of Admissions.\nYou may want to consider enrolling in prerequisite coursework prior to applying for admission.The AIM program at Heinz College is quantitatively-focused. In order to ensure success for our master’s students, the faculty have established guidelines for preparedness that must be achieved prior to starting classes at Heinz College. It is ideal for students to demonstrate the required quantitative and technical preparation prior to submitting their application. However, there are opportunities for students to complete the following requirements once admitted to the program prior to the start of the first semester as an AIM student:College / university-level Calculus (can also be satisfied with a Calculus II class or higher) OR submission of GRE/GMAT with a minimum of 65%ile or higher on the quantitative sectionCollege / university-level Introductory StatisticsCollege / university-level Introductory Python Programming (Java and C++ are also acceptable)If you don’t meet all 3 criteria at the time of application, you may be offered conditional admission and be required to take the class(es) over the summer immediately preceding the start of your first semester at Heinz. Please note the following for the required quantitative and technical classes:Must be a college-/ university-level course at an accredited institutionMust be for credit and a grade of B or higherThe course may be taken on-campus or online Courses that do not grant credit and a grade will not fulfill these requirements, even if you receive a certificate of completion for the course.

Be sure to devote appropriate attention to the Cost of Living in the various cities you are considering for graduate school. If you are going to relocate and spend two years in graduate school, why not select a place where your money goes further?Compared to Pittsburgh, the cost of living is 33% higher in Washington, D.C., 42% higher in San Francisco, and 57% higher in New York City. Pittsburgh's combination of affordability, cultural and entertainment opportunities, and booming tech scene make it an unbeatable destination for grad school.

For me, one key factor was getting that early advantage in learning about these technologies of the future from great faculty. These faculty have years of experience in the field and it’s been great to learn firsthand from people who are so passionate about what they do.\nAtharva Joshi | Heinz '23,  Project Manager - AI & Data Analytics at L'Oreal\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAIM-ING for a Better Career\n\n\n \n\nWhat Can I Do With A Master's in AI?
