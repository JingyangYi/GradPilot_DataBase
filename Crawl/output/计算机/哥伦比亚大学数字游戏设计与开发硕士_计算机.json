If your program is rolling or has an extended\r\n            deadline indicated above, applications are reviewed as they are received\r\n            and on a space-available basis. We recommend you complete your\r\n            application as soon as possible as these programs can close earlier if\r\n            full capacity has been met.\nFor admission-related inquiries, please contact MSTadmission@tc.columbia.edu.\nDisplaying catalog information for the Fall 2024, Spring 2025 and Summer 2025 terms.\nView Full Catalog Listing\nDesign and Development of Digital Games (TEDG)\nThe M.A. degree program in Design and Development of Digital Games is a 32-33 point degree program that prepares students to design, develop, implement and evaluate digital games and closely related technologies (such as mobile apps, interactive media, virtual and augmented reality) for learning and social impact in both formal and informal educational settings. This program is unique in that the curriculum is structured to examine game design from a combination of social, cultural, cognitive, and affective perspectives. Students who are studying the design and development of games for education as a concentration need the degree to reflect this area of study, which is not only optimal but necessary for their intended goals.\nGames and closely related technologies are increasingly important for learning and for professional education and training in schools, medicine, business, entertainment, and other domains. Rapid changes in these technologies are reshaping the ways we create, evaluate, reflect, reason, and learn. The interdisciplinary nature of game design has led to more creative approaches in teaching and learning in both informal learning contexts (such as museums and homes) and formal learning contexts (classrooms, schools, and workplaces).\nThe skills involved in designing, developing and studying games are relevant to a wide variety of careers, for instance: instructional design, coding, web and app development, project management, user experience (UX) design, illustration, 3D modeling, and so on. Whether pursuing a career specifically in games (commercial or educational game design) or intending to use games as a means to other endeavors, this program is an exciting and modern platform for a future career journey.\nCourses in the M.A. degree program provide a solid foundation in both theoretical and practical aspects to the design of educational technology (of which games are a part), which are very relevant to the design of games that target learning—often called educational games. Similarly, the development of educational (or other) games depends upon the ability to program such games, or, at the very least, to have enough programming knowledge to be able to communicate appropriately with programmers who will develop games based on design specifications.\nTherefore, courses on game development, for example, complement the required programming course sequences that teach programming skills that may be applied to games.\nMinimum Point Requirement\nA minimum of 32 points of coursework is required for completion of the degree. Course credits from previous, non-Teachers College work cannot be transferred in to count toward the 32 points required for the M.A. degree.\nRequired Core Courses (10 points)\nRequired courses:\nMSTU 4000: Core Seminar (1 point), taken in first semester\nMSTU 4088 Introduction to Learning Sciences and Educational Technology (3 points)\nMSTU 4083: Instructional Design of Educational Technology (3 points)\nMSTU 4900: Integrative Project Seminar (0 or 1 point), taken in final semester\nFor the remaining points, choose between:\nMSTU 4020: Social and Communicative Aspects of ICTs (3 points)\nMSTU 4005: Equity, Ethics and Social Issues (3 points)\nMSTU 4504: Ethical Issues in Technology Design (3 points)\nRequirements in the Major Area (15 points)\n6 points selected from any three programming courses:\nMSTU 5003: Theory and Programming of Interactive Media I (3 points), MSTU 5013: Theory and Programming of Interactive Media II (3 points), or 5007: Development of XR and Games\nOther programming courses approved by academic adviser\nFor the remaining 9 points, choose any combination of the following courses:\nMSTU 4039: Game Design Fundamentals: Theory and Practice of Game Design (3 points)\nMSTU 4040: Mobile Learning (3 points)\nMSTU 5000: Virtual, Augmented, Mixed Reality and Games as Learning Tools (3 points)\nMSTU 5015: Research/Programming in Serious Games (3 points)\nMSTU 6000: Advanced Design of Educational Games (3 points)\nElective Courses (1-3 points)\n1-3 points of additional MSTU courses.\nBreadth Requirement: (6-9 points)\nAll students must complete a minimum of 6 points at Teachers College outside of the Communication, Media and Learning Technologies Design Program (that is, courses with a prefix other than MSTU).\nIntegrative M.A. Project\nCandidates for the M.A. degree are expected to culminate their work with an integrative project. Projects vary but share the common following features:\nEmpirically based and grounded in the research literature\nAddress a problem or phenomenon of the student's interest and area of study\nProvide a solution to the problem\nSome examples include:\nDesign of a new game, app, virtual reality experience or other form of interactive media\nCase study analysis of a trend in the field of game-based learning\nDevelopment of new models, curriculum, and/or lessons integrating technology\nOn-site field study and recommendations for teachers\nSpecifics of the integrative project are determined through discussions with the students' advisors.\nFor students completing only the M.A. degree, this project should be related to their career goals and should provide tangible evidence of their skills and strengths.\nProgram Director: Professor Ioana Literat\nTeachers College, Columbia University322 Thompson Hall\nPhone: (212) 678-3344\nFax: (212) 678-3344\nEmail: tccmltd@tc.columbia.edu\n• Points/Credits: 32\n• Entry Terms: Fall\n• Enrollment Formats: Full-Time Campus-Based, Part-Time Campus-Based\n• Required courses:\n• MSTU 4000: Core Seminar (1 point), taken in first semester\n• MSTU 4088 Introduction to Learning Sciences and Educational Technology (3 points)\n• MSTU 4083: Instructional Design of Educational Technology (3 points)\n• MSTU 4900: Integrative Project Seminar (0 or 1 point), taken in final semester\n• For the remaining points, choose between:\n• MSTU 4020: Social and Communicative Aspects of ICTs (3 points)\n• MSTU 4005: Equity, Ethics and Social Issues (3 points)\n• MSTU 4504: Ethical Issues in Technology Design (3 points)\n• 6 points selected from any three programming courses:\n• MSTU 5003: Theory and Programming of Interactive Media I (3 points), MSTU 5013: Theory and Programming of Interactive Media II (3 points), or 5007: Development of XR and Games\n• Other programming courses approved by academic adviser\n• For the remaining 9 points, choose any combination of the following courses:\n• MSTU 4039: Game Design Fundamentals: Theory and Practice of Game Design (3 points)\n• MSTU 4040: Mobile Learning (3 points)\n• MSTU 5000: Virtual, Augmented, Mixed Reality and Games as Learning Tools (3 points)\n• MSTU 5015: Research/Programming in Serious Games (3 points)\n• MSTU 6000: Advanced Design of Educational Games (3 points)\n• Empirically based and grounded in the research literature\n• Address a problem or phenomenon of the student's interest and area of study\n• Provide a solution to the problem\n• Design of a new game, app, virtual reality experience or other form of interactive media\n• Case study analysis of a trend in the field of game-based learning\n• Development of new models, curriculum, and/or lessons integrating technology\n• On-site field study and recommendations for teachers\n• View Other Degrees\n[HTML_TABLE]\nEntry Term Available | Priority Deadlines | Final Deadlines | Extended Deadlines\nSpring | N/A | N/A | N/A\nSummer | N/A | N/A | N/A\nFall | January 15, 2026 | January 15, 2026 | N/A\n[HTML_TABLE]\n | Requirement\n | Online Degree Application, including Statement of Purpose and Resume\n | Transcripts and/or Course-by-Course Evaluations for all Undergraduate/Graduate Coursework Completed\n | Results from an accepted English Proficiency Exam (if applicable)\n | $75 Application Fee\n | Two (2) Letters of Recommendation\n | Video essay required for all non-native English speakers (included in online application)\n[CARD]\nBox: 8",

In order to be considered for admission to a degree program:\nAll applicants must have a conferred baccalaureate degree before matriculating at Teachers College.\nTeachers College reviews applications for Spring, Summer, and Fall entry. However, not all programs or degree levels are available for all entry terms. Applications must be for an available entry term (based on program and degree level) in order to be considered for admission. Applicants may only have one active application at a time, and may only apply to one degree program per cycle. Applicants are expected to collect and prepare all credentials, including any international educational evaluations, well in advance of the application deadline. Incomplete records will not be reviewed.\nPlease note that students may not be enrolled concurrently in two different institutions and may not be in two different degree programs or areas of specializations at Teachers College or Columbia University.\nUnder no circumstances can any application materials submitted to the Office of Admission be returned to the applicant or forwarded to another college, university, or place of business. All records submitted in support of an application for admission become part of a student's permanent record at Teachers College.\nWhen completing the application, select the program and term for which you plan to apply. We encourage applicants to review program deadlines and requirements on the Programs Search page prior to applying. Use a single email address that will not expire before your desired term of entry, as it will be used for all correspondence from the Office of Admission.\nIn addition to collecting your personal information, the online application form will also serve as the portal to submit the application requirements below. Expand the titles below to learn more about preparing these important required documents.\nYour Statement of Purpose should describe your academic and professional background, your objectives for graduate school, and how you will positively contribute to the Teachers College community.\nThe resume should be a chronological listing of your employment history, educational history, academic endeavors, community service, and other significant or meaningful activities. It is also an ideal location to showcase any awards, publications, or any other achievements to support your application for admission.\nTeachers College requires two letters of recommendation. Some programs require an additional letter, or a letter from a specific source. Please review the Programs Search  page for more information. A maximum of three letters may be submitted. Recommendation letters may only be submitted online. All letters of recommendation must be uploaded by the recommender (not the applicant) using professional letterhead and the recommender's professional email address. Failure to follow this protocol will result in delays in application processing. If a professional email address is not available, you will be asked to include an explanation.\nWhenever possible, recommendations should be written by academic sources. If you have been out of school for a number of years, professional recommendations may be used in most cases. Recommendations should not be written by family members or friends. Your recommendation should directly address your suitability for admission to a graduate degree program at Teachers College.\nIn order for your application to be considered complete and eligible for review, letters of recommendation must be received by the deadline, along with all other required application materials.\nSome programs require supplemental materials, such as a third letter of recommendation, an academic writing sample, or additional questions specific to the course of study. Search for your intended program below to see what materials are required.\n{{result.degreeType}} {{result.certName}}\nApplication Requirements:\nAdditional Information:\nAs part of the application for admission, applicants are required to submit up-to-date transcripts reflecting a complete academic history, including all undergraduate and graduate coursework they have completed. Please be sure to add a new institution within your application for every school that has awarded you postsecondary-level course credits, including degree-granting institutions, transfer credit schools, postgraduate enrichment coursework, and study abroad programs. Full course titles, number of credits, and final grades must be reflected on all transcripts. Expand the titles below to read more about how to submit documents that meet our requirements.\nTo expedite the processing of your application, please utilize the official e-transcript delivery. Transcripts received by postal mail will take longer to process.\nIf you attended an institution in the United States, you have the option to upload a scanned copy of your transcript—through your online application—to allow for faster application processing. This should be a scanned or electronic copy of a transcript obtained directly from the Office of the Registrar at the issuing institution. Both your name and the name of the institution should be clearly visible.Uploaded transcripts for degree-granting institutions, transfer credit schools, postgraduate enrichment coursework, and study abroad programs for all undergraduate and graduate coursework completed should include the following information:\nTranscripts uploaded by the applicant are considered unofficial. This feature is offered in order to save you time and ensure that a record of your academic progress is included with your submitted application. It eliminates the need to have transcripts sent to us during the initial processing and review of your application, and precludes any delays resulting from the non-receipt of a transcript.Only if you are admitted to Teachers College and choose to enroll will you be required to have final, official transcripts submitted by all academic institutions listed on your application. Your offer of admission will be contingent upon the receipt and verification of these official transcripts, which must be submitted directly by the Office of the Registrar (or equivalent office) of their issuing institutions. Failure to supply final official transcripts may impact your ability to register for classes. Teachers College reserves the right to rescind an offer of admission if there is a discrepancy between the uploaded version/evaluation and the official original transcript(s).While you are not required to submit official transcripts at the point of application, this is recommended to ensure your application is reviewed in its completeness. If your institution provides official electronic transcripts, you may have those transcripts issued to transcripts@tc.columbia.edu. Please note that transcripts that are emailed as an attachment—whether by the institution or the applicant—are considered unofficial.\nIf your institution does not provide official electronic transcripts, you may have the institution mail your official paper transcript to the following address:\nOffice of AdmissionTeachers College, Columbia University, BOX 302525 West 120th StreetNew York, NY 10027\nApplicants who have completed, or are completing, undergraduate and/or graduate degrees at institutions outside of the United States are required to submit a full course-by-course evaluation including verified transcripts for U.S. degree equivalency. The evaluations must be prepared and sent by one of the two providers listed below. To ensure application review, full course-by-course evaluations must be received by the application deadline.Please note this does not pertain to applicants from the United States who have spent a semester or year studying abroad. This requirement is only applicable for degree-granting institutions.Teachers College will accept evaluations from the following organizations:\nThese organizations provide several types of evaluations. Please select the course-by-course evaluation option to ensure your evaluation meets our requirements for admission review. To have your evaluation sent to Teachers College, select \"Teachers College - Columbia University\" (for WES) and \"Teachers College, Columbia University\" (for ECE). Evaluations sent to Columbia University will not be received by Teachers College.Applications are not considered complete without a course-by-course evaluation. The determination of degree equivalency to a U.S. degree is at the discretion of the College. Once submitted to Teachers College, the evaluation becomes an official academic record and sole property of Teachers College upon its receipt.Applicants who attended institutions outside of the United States but did not complete degrees must submit these transcripts in order to be considered for admission review. Please note that if these transcripts are not in English, they must be accompanied by certified English translations. As with U.S.-based institutions, copies should be uploaded to your online application to ensure timely processing. If you are admitted to Teachers College and choose to enroll, you will be required to have final, official transcripts submitted by all academic institutions listed on your application. It is recommended that you also request official transcripts from the issuing institution as early as possible, as international transcript requests may be delayed.\nPlease note: Course-by-course evaluations must clearly state that you have earned or will be earning the equivalent of a U.S. Bachelor’s degree upon completion of your program. If you are admitted to Teachers College and your in-progress WES or ECE course-by-course evaluation does not indicate that you will earn the equivalent of a U.S. Bachelor’s degree, you will be expected upon conferral to submit a second course-by-course evaluation from WES or ECE confirming you have earned the equivalent of a U.S. Bachelor's degree. You will not be able to register for classes at Teachers College without fulfilling this requirement.\nNot all students are required to submit results from standardized testing. Please consult the Programs Search page to see if your program requires supplemental materials, and please review the English Proficiency section below if your native language is not English.\nIf required, all test scores must be official scores sent directly from the test administrator to the Office of Admission and must be received by the deadline. For the GRE, TOEFL, or other tests administered by Educational Testing Services (ETS), the assigned institution code for Teachers College is 2905.\nMost degree programs do not require GRE scores for admission. Please consult the Programs Search page to see requirements for your degree of interest. If you are submitting GRE scores, only exams taken within the last 5 years are valid. All scores must be received by the application deadline. The assigned institution code for Teachers College is 2905.\nIf your native language is not English and you have not received a baccalaureate (undergraduate) degree from an institution where English was the sole official language of instruction, you must submit official scores from an accepted English proficiency exam. We accept the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) and the International English Language Testing System (IELTS).\nIn order to be considered official, scores must be sent directly from the testing administrator and have been taken within the past 2 years.\nThe accepted tests and minimum scores are:\nNote: Teaching of English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) and Applied Linguistics have different English proficiency requirements and policies, refer to the program website for details.\nIf you have taken the TOEFL exam multiple times and your MyBest Score meets our minimum score requirement, please order an official score report that reflects your MyBest Score to be sent to Teachers College. Then, please contact the Office of Admission at admission@tc.columbia.edu to ensure that your MyBest Score is reflected in your application. We do not require individual score reports if a MyBest Score is submitted.\nIf you have not earned an undergraduate degree at an institution where English was the sole official language of instruction, but you have successfully completed a graduate degree at a school that meets this criteria, you are not required to submit official results from an accepted English proficiency exam.
