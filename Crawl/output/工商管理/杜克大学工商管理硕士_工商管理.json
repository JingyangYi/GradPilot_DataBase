Here, you’ll find opportunities to learn and grow by going outside your comfort zone—exploring classes and experiences that help you take initiative, push your limits, and develop the many different skills you’ll need for long-term success.\nYour journey begins with an intense month of orientation and immersion in a rigorous, hands-on program of three courses that emphasize leading and managing in an uncertain world. It’s designed to broaden your perspective, challenge the ways you think, and prepare you for 2 amazing years of MBA study.\nThe remainder of the academic year is organized into four 6-week terms of MBA classes that each meet twice a week for 2 hours and 15 minutes. The term structure allows you to take a wide variety of courses and choose electives sooner, which can better prepare you for your internship.\nAll first-year students are assigned to a team of four to five peers with whom they will complete group projects for various courses. Your team will be hand-picked to allow you to learn from people who look, think, and work differently from you. You’ll learn to draw on each team member’s strengths and move the group toward a common purpose.\nEvery year hundreds of students gain exposure to international business through our Global Academic Travel Experience (GATE), Fuqua Client Consulting Practicum (FCCP), or the study abroad program with top business schools in 28 different countries.\nAll of our degree programs are taught by Fuqua’s top-ranked faculty, who are recognized for excellence in teaching and industry-shaping research. The courses they teach are academically challenging and relevant to the business world today. Despite world-class credentials, our faculty is highly accessible—they emphasize an open-door policy that encourages both collaboration with students and interdisciplinary thinking. Often, these teachers become your mentors for life.\nFuqua’s professors use lectures, case studies, strategic games, simulations, visiting executives, and their own research to create a dynamic learning experience that pushes you to think and work in new and different ways. The result? You get a deep and broad understanding of current business topics.\n1. Case Studies\nCase studies are real examples of corporate challenges that give you the opportunity to put theory to work. You gain industry knowledge and an appreciation for the management, operations, and leadership challenges that companies face every day.\n2. Strategic Games\nWe've all played games before, but in an MBA classroom, they take on a whole new meaning. Fuqua teaches you to recognize patterns and understand the basic nature of games. You’ll learn to identify those that are happening around you and that you’re part of, so you can see the big picture, your options, and possible outcomes.\n3. Realistic Simulations\nThe use of sophisticated business simulation teaches you how to run a company in a realistic business environment.

Daytime MBA\nFast. Focused. Future-oriented.\nThe Fuqua difference starts with the structure of our Daytime MBA program. Here, you’ll find opportunities to learn and grow by going outside your comfort zone—exploring classes and experiences that help you take initiative, push your limits, and develop the many different skills you’ll need for long-term success.\nGetting started\nYour journey begins with an intense month of orientation and immersion in a rigorous, hands-on program of three courses that emphasize leading and managing in an uncertain world. It’s designed to broaden your perspective, challenge the ways you think, and prepare you for 2 amazing years of MBA study.\nThe remainder of the academic year is organized into four 6-week terms of MBA classes that each meet twice a week for 2 hours and 15 minutes. The term structure allows you to take a wide variety of courses and choose electives sooner, which can better prepare you for your internship. \nTeam up\nAll first-year students are assigned to a team of four to five peers with whom they will complete group projects for various courses. Your team will be hand-picked to allow you to learn from people who look, think, and work differently from you. You’ll learn to draw on each team member’s strengths and move the group toward a common purpose.\nGo global\nEvery year hundreds of students gain exposure to international business through our Global Academic Travel Experience (GATE), Fuqua Client Consulting Practicum (FCCP), or the study abroad program with top business schools in 28 different countries.\nOur Learning Environment\n\nOur Faculty\nAll of our degree programs are taught by Fuqua’s top-ranked faculty, who are recognized for excellence in teaching and industry-shaping research. The courses they teach are academically challenging and relevant to the business world today. Despite world-class credentials, our faculty is highly accessible—they emphasize an open-door policy that encourages both collaboration with students and interdisciplinary thinking. Often, these teachers become your mentors for life.\nOur Teaching Methods\nFuqua’s professors use lectures, case studies, strategic games, simulations, visiting executives, and their own research to create a dynamic learning experience that pushes you to think and work in new and different ways. The result? You get a deep and broad understanding of current business topics.\nMaking Theory Real\n1. Case Studies\nCase studies are real examples of corporate challenges that give you the opportunity to put theory to work. You gain industry knowledge and an appreciation for the management, operations, and leadership challenges that companies face every day.\n2. Strategic Games\nWe've all played games before, but in an MBA classroom, they take on a whole new meaning. Fuqua teaches you to recognize patterns and understand the basic nature of games. You’ll learn to identify those that are happening around you and that you’re part of, so you can see the big picture, your options, and possible outcomes.\n3. Realistic Simulations\nThe use of sophisticated business simulation teaches you how to run a company in a realistic business environment. You’ll get hands-on experience that goes way beyond what you’d learn in a textbook.\n4. Research Centers\nOur research centers are vital links between academic inquiry and real-world business. They create insights, dialogue, and curricula that change the course of business and enrich the Duke MBA student experience.

We encourage you to take part in our campus visit program and Blue Devil Weekend (for admitted students). Visiting campus, either in person or virtually, will not only provide insight to inform your final decision to join the program, but will also provide you with information on transitioning to the Durham area.\nAccess our incoming student website\nShortly after admission, you will receive access to our incoming student website. This will be your main source of information, helping you more fully understand our community and our expectations and giving you a better idea of what it will be like to be a full-time MBA student at Duke.\nHere you’ll find all the information you'll need to transition into your new academic life:\nApply for a visa\nIf applicable, visa application information will be included in your student portal along with specific deadlines for submission. Visa processing can take up to several months to complete, so it is critical you apply in Early Action, Round 1,  Round 2, or Round 3 to ensure that you are able to join the program on time.\nLegible, scanned copies of all unofficial transcripts are required for each college or university you have attended where you:\nIf you took classes at a college or university while in high school, do not list the college or university as a separate school in your application.\nFor transfer credits: Follow the guidelines listed above, but please note that for any transferred credits that qualify to be reported, we need to see grades/marks.  If the grades/marks as well as the credits appear on your degree-conferring institution's transcript, then the additional transcript will not be required.\nFor student abroad credits: Please follow the same guidelines as for transfer credits.\nIf your transcripts do not state the degree and date conferred, upload a copy of your diploma in addition to the transcript. If your transcript is not in English, it must be translated, attested, and uploaded along with the originals. Those applying from outside the U.S. should see additional transcript guidelines for international students.\nTo be eligible to apply, an applicant must have earned, or be in the process of completing, a bachelor’s degree from an accredited college or university. No specific undergraduate major is considered preferable to any other.

The due date for official transcripts will be noted in your admitted student portal. If you have not yet completed your studies by this date, your official transcripts should reach The Fuqua School of Business no later than one week before your program begins.\nYou’ll need to provide your thoughts on one short answer and two longer essay questions as part of your application.\nInstructions for all written submissions\nAll essays are scanned using plagiarism detection software. Expressing your ideas by using verbiage from existing sources, including websites and other applicants' essays or materials, or having someone else compose your essays, without properly crediting those sources constitutes an act of plagiarism. Plagiarism, an act of theft and fraud, is considered a cheating violation within the Honor Code and will result in an application denial. Note: if you have worked with a consultant to complete your application materials, please ensure that the Honor Code policy is discussed and yours essays will not be shared with other potential applicants.\nRequired short-answer essay question\nInstructions: Answer the following question in 100 words.\nFirst required essay: 25 random things about yourself\nThe 'Team Fuqua' spirit and community is one of the things that sets the MBA experience apart, and it is a concept that extends beyond the student body to include faculty, staff, and administration.

The Optional Information section is intended to provide the admissions committee with insight into your circumstances only.\nSubmit your required one-page resume electronically within the online application system.

The education section should include dates of attendance and degrees received.\nYour resume can include:\nYour recommender must complete the current recommendation forms associated with the online application—no other format of recommendation will be accepted.\nYour recommendation should reflect your performance in your most recent professional setting.

In Durham you’ll have the best of city, suburban, and rural living. In fact, there are as many reasons to love living here as there are Fuqua students. Within minutes, you can explore downtown or do some great shopping. Need a break? Kick back in the serenity of Duke Forest. You’ll enjoy discovering an area that’s been ranked one of nation's most livable and exciting places for business by Money, Fortune, Forbes, Entrepreneur Magazine, and more. Despite its more intimate personality, Raleigh-Durham is home to more than 1.3 million people.\nToday, Durham is a global economic player driven by knowledge-based enterprises—including everything from software and information technology to film and TV production. It is also home to one of the oldest and largest science parks in the U.S., the Research Triangle Park (RTP), which houses more than 250 companies—from Fortune 100 multinational operations to university spinouts and start-ups. In fact, Inc. Magazine ranked Durham as one of the 7 of the hottest start-up hubs outside of Silicon Valley, and Forbes Magazine ranked the area as #2 among the best places for business and careers.\nThanks to having so many enterprises just a stone’s throw from campus, we’re able to invite influential local speakers, connect businesses with student clubs, and tap our more than 3,000 local Fuqua alumni as mentors for students.\nA sample of employers in the Research Triangle Park includes:\nBayer CropScienceBD TechnologiesBiogen IDECCredit SuisseCiscoDupontFidelityGlaxoSmithKlineIBMLenovoRTI InternationalUnited States Environmental Protection Agency\nDurham is an eclectic city, with a diverse mix of historical and cultural places, offbeat shopping, sports venues, arts festivals, houses of worship, and great restaurants. Known for everything from laid-back Carolina BBQ joints to charming donut shops and trendy microbreweries, Durham was voted America’s foodiest small town by Bon Appetit.\nWithin just a few hours’ drive from campus are the Blue Ridge Mountains for hiking and mountain activities, the Atlantic coast for beaches and water sports, or the NC Sandhills area for champion golf. Washington, D.C., is just 4 hours by car—or hop a 1-hour flight to New York City or a direct flight to London or Paris.\nDurham is filled with amazing ways to spend your free time. But there are some great things to do right on campus, too. So make time to experience all the cultural activities, sports events, and popular sites that the Duke University campus has to offer.\nAn iconic symbol of the university, it was built in 1932 and stands at the center of the Gothic West Campus. It features a 210-foot tower, a 50-bell carillon, 77 stained glass windows, and seating for 1,600 people.\nCovering 55 acres of landscaped and woodland gardens in the heart of Duke's West Campus, it is open to the public daily from 8:00 a.m. to dusk. Each year more than 300,000 visitors enjoy the gardens' five miles of walkways and more than 8,000 species and varieties of plants.\nDesigned by architect Rafael Viñoly, The Nasher is a major center for the arts on campus. Its permanent collection includes some of today’s best contemporary art, with a focus on work by artists of African descent, European medieval art, and European and American paintings.\nLocated in more than 7,000 acres in the north-central Piedmont, it serves as a natural outdoor laboratory for Duke and neighboring universities, and its trails are popular with local walkers and runners.\nCameron is considered the crown jewel of college basketball. Originally conceived on the back of a matchbook cover in 1935, it is now the celebrated home of the Duke Blue Devils.\nPage Auditorium is Duke's largest theater, with a capacity of 1,200 seats. It has been the site of thousands of performances and lectures since its opening in 1930, including speeches by Sen. John F. Kennedy in 1959 and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1964.\nThe Duke Lemur Center is the only university-based facility in the world devoted to the study of prosimian primates and is home to the world's largest colony of endangered primates.\nIt’s easy to make your home at Fuqua. In fact, the Durham area is touted as one of the best places to live in the country in part due to the affordable standard of living. While housing options are plentiful in Durham, there is limited graduate student housing on Duke’s campus—so MBA students typically find off-campus housing.\nOur Off-Campus Housing site is a searchable database of houses, apartments, and rooms for rent. It’s just one of the resources available to help you find accommodations and roommates.\nTeam up in 6-week terms.\nDesign your own experience from 100+ electives.\nEnhance your skills in a focus area.\nCombine your MBA with another Duke program.\nGet outside your comfort zone by exploring a new culture.\nDevelop your abilities beyond the classroom.\nLeverage our resources to power your job search.\nEnjoy one of the nation’s most exciting—and livable—cities.\nHere's what you need to get started.\nWe want to hear your story.\nLearn about Fuqua in person or online.\nSee a snapshot of our current class.\nDetermine your investment.\nLearn how to fund the program.\n[GRID_TABLE]\nProgram Location - Daytime MBA\nDrop a pin on Durham\nThey say that good things come in threes.

Done that?\n[HEADING] Course highlights\n[HEADING] Ideas Become Reality in the Duke Start-Up Challenge\n[HEADING] Explore This Program\n[HEADING] Program Format\n[HEADING] Curriculum\n[HEADING] Concentrations + Certificates\n[HEADING] Dual Degrees\n[HEADING] Global Opportunities\n[HEADING] Experiential Learning\n[HEADING] Career Development\n[HEADING] Program Location\n[HEADING] Facts + Dates\n[HEADING] Application Instructions\n[HEADING] Admissions Events\n[HEADING] Class Profile\n[HEADING] Tuition + Costs\n[HEADING] Financing Your Degree\nThe Daytime MBA program isn't designed for you—it's designed by you. Our highly customizable curriculum gives you the opportunity to try new things and learn from different perspectives. Here, you’ll have only 13 mandated core classes—and more flexibility to select from over 100 electives to pursue the topics of most interest to you. Since Fuqua doesn’t specialize in one skill or industry, you’ll be prepared to understand many different aspects of business that can help you take different career paths after graduation.\nAlready have extensive experience in finance, statistics, or another core subject? By demonstrating prior mastery of core MBA course material, you may be granted an exemption from that course, so you can diversify into more advanced courses or electives from the beginning of your studies.\nExplore a selection of the core courses and electives available to you.\nFinancial Accounting\nLearn to construct and interpret corporate financial reports. By the end of the course, you should have a basic understanding of financial statements and the ability to use them for decision-making.\nManagerial Accounting\nManagerial Accounting emphasizes the use of accounting information for internal purposes. In this course, you’ll cover the design of management accounting systems for planning and controlling operations and for motivating personnel. You’ll integrate accounting with ideas from microeconomics, data analysis, decision analysis, finance, and operations management.\nFoundations of Business Analytics\nRegardless of the setting, many management decisions are made under conditions of uncertainty. This course introduces a framework for thinking about problems involving uncertainty and, building on this framework, develops tools for interpreting data. The goal of the course is to sharpen your quantitative and analytical skills, and to provide a foundation in probability and statistics for a management career.\nDecision Models\nSuccessful management requires the ability to recognize a decision situation, understand its essential features, and make a choice. However, many such situations may be too difficult to grasp intuitively, or the stakes may be too high to learn by experience. In these cases, we may benefit from using decision models - simplified representations of these situations that allow you to consider the different possible scenarios (i.e., ask \"what if\") and learn more about the problem.\nManagerial Economics\nIn this course, you’ll examine market behavior and focus on the actions and reactions of businesses and consumers in a variety of market environments. You’ll master basic tools of microeconomics: supply and demand analysis, firms’ production and pricing decisions, market equilibrium and market structure analysis, and the principles of strategic behavior.\nThe Art & Application of Game Theory\nPeople rarely make decisions in a vacuum.
