You might be seeking promotion, or vying for an executive role for which you’re not yet qualified. Or perhaps you just really want to make your start-up dream a reality and don’t have the skills to know how to manage a business.\nThis is when you might consider an MBA – a big decision that has the potential for big rewards. As Professor Allan Trench, UWA MBA Director, explains,\n“We teach our MBAs to speak and practice the language of major business and industry firms so we’re really preparing people to operate successfully in very senior decision-making environments.

You may even want a career shift or an entirely different career altogether.\nTo help you reach your career objectives, an excellent MBA program should have dedicated career mentoring for students, including individualised career coaching through a career advisor and an industry mentor, a suite of career development workshops, online resources and presentations by industry leaders whose experience you can learn from.\nRecent graduate Joel Turco, for instance, found career mentoring a highlight in his MBA experience: “Through the mentoring program I received direct access to some of the brightest business minds in the country.

I chose to study a Master of Laws by coursework because I believe that the course will build on my knowledge base and I was attracted to the option of choosing from a wide range of units. I am thoroughly enjoying the flexibility of the intensive units on offer.  I work full-time in the city so my time away from the office is limited, so doing an intensive unit is most conducive to my working hours and provides me with the flexibility that I need. \n\nWith UWA being a top 1% university in the world, the choice to study here was easy. UWA has an exceptional reputation and I wanted to be part of that.\n[CARD]\nMaha Chaar\n[CARD]\nThe UWA Law School is ranked in the top 150 law schools in the world for Law and Legal Studies (QS 2025).

To discover their Aspirational Purpose and Values and to start to let go of the expert’s mindset and become more curious. This willingness to dwell in the unknown creates the opportunity to lean into the emerging future while staying present, curious, compassionate, and courageous.\"\nAuthentic Leadership Program\n\nOrganisations and communities facing turmoil and uncertainty need leaders who can find the space to lead. This transformational leadership program inspires participants to expand their human potential to its very highest, and to contribute from their highest future self.\nIndividuals have the opportunity to evolve into extraordinary leaders able to lead with Purpose, Clarity, Compassion and Impact.\nThe Authentic Leadership Program consists of the following five opportunities:\n1. Leading Self and Leading Others unit (BUSN 5000)\nStudents thrive in this unit, passing along immensely positive feedback:\n\"Leading Self, Leading Others was the most valuable unit for me. It takes one beyond standard business administration pedagogy by enabling the impetus for personal development. Jenny Hoffman’s unique coaching approach eloquently guides participants to recognise and draw on valuable internal resources, whilst honing critical soft skills that are increasingly in demand in today’s workplace and highly sought after in the leaders of tomorrow.\"\n--Pearl Chua\n“The path to becoming a leader does not happen in a single day nor even in one unit. It needs constant work on oneself. Sometimes it is not fun when one needs to look into the deepest corners of one’s own soul and identify new ways to grow. As many people say, “if you want to teach something to someone, inspire them by your example.” Doing Leading Self and Others: Leadership Challenge unit was not easy at it seemed to be at a first glance but Jenny Hoffman served as a beam of light during the darkness and helped me to better navigate in the ocean of leadership uncertainty and to get the right wind into my leadership sails that will one day become a big ship that carries others”.\n--Elena Rushikhina\n\"First, thank you for teaching that unit in the most amazing way. I feel the unit is essential for any person who wants to grow sustainably in his/her career. Everybody talks about leading others but what I loved most was the leading-self part. The in-class exercises and reflective assignments helped me discover areas of improvement. The unit not only made me better at leading others but also has made me a better person by helping me to identify and fill gaps. This is why I feel my growth now will be a sustainable one. Once again, many thanks for awesome learnings.\"\n--Aashish Sharma\n2. Playback Theatre\nPerth Playback Theatre was founded in 1982 and is a member of the International Playback Theatre Network which fosters training, research and new developments in interactive and improvised theatre. The 12-session Leading Self, Leading Others unit opens with a performance from this inspiring group of actors and musicians who work to develop relationships, remove barriers and develop the cohort experience that is integral to the MBA Intensive Program.\nParticipants are invited to give voice to their leadership stories, and to explore what leadership means to them while bringing to life the personal experiences of the participants and bringing them closer together with heart, humour and honesty.\n3. Leadership Survey and Debrief\n\nA central feature of this program is the provision of individualised feedback through a number of surveys. This includes the  Print® Survey is a validated, proprietary on-line instrument developed by the The Paul Hertz Group. At a foundational level PRINT® provides an opportunity to raise self-awareness not only about what motivates and satisfies an individual, but also their unique set of Best Self (positive and productive) and potential Shadow (negative, unproductive and automatic) behaviours. These behaviours are the direct outcome of a person’s unique motivational DNA, called Unconscious Motivators®. Print® also reveals how different people respond to negative stimuli (Triggers), and how they can be re-patterned. Students participate in a group Debrief session with highly experienced Executive Coaches.\n\n\n4. Leader as Coach Workshop\n\nCoaching and coaching approaches to leadership and management are recognised as a powerful enabler of successful talent development and organisational transformation where self-discovery, personal initiative, empowerment and responsibility are encouraged for individual team members and whole teams. This session is delivered using Executive Leadership coaches to provide participants with the opportunity to:\n-Develop their abilities in using a Leader as Coach approach;\n-Explore their personal barriers and strengths in developing a Leader as Coach approach;\n-Understand and practice using coaching tools, models and skills in real coaching situations with peers and in the workplace;\n-Understand the role of conversation and relationships in organisations, in particular listening and questioning in building shared understanding, real trust and gaining committed action; and\n-Develop their abilities to influence conversations to be more productive and future focused.\n5. Authentic Leaders Series\n\nA series of intimate leadership conversations between extraordinary leaders from a range of industries provide an opportunity for students to hear firsthand accounts of their leadership experiences, including not only their personal best leadership experiences but also where they have had to play at the edge of their competence. Increased disruption and uncertainty require that leaders will have to learn how to fail gracefully without pretending they know what they don’t know.\nUWA MBA students have the opportunity to undertake an international study tour. During a tour of the LinkedIn office at San Francisco, students were exposed to the latest developments in advanced data analytics and changes to the future of work.

From there, you will proceed through your studies according to the table below, and depending upon which study mode you have selected. ‘Option’ indicates where you are able to complete one of your three required option units.\nIn addition to these three study modes, it is possible to personalise your program.

Students spent a day at Stanford University receiving lectures from Stanford professors in the areas of innovation and entrepreneurship.

Additionally, the program has strengthened my ability to develop and commercialize innovation, positioning me to make a greater impact as I advance in my career.”\nEvelyn Ng, MBA 2024\nGroup Manager Materials and Innovation at Callidus Group\nAdelaide Bevilaqua\nBachelor of Science, Conservation Biology and Management with honours, UWA\nAssociate Principal Marine Ecologist , BMT Commercial Australia\n\nPlease tell us about your career to date.  \nI graduated from the University of Western Australia with a BSc (Hons) in Conservation Biology and Management in 2009, at which point I was already working on a casual basis for Oceanica (now BMT Commercial Australia), as a laboratory assistant. Shortly after graduation I was offered a full-time position and have been with the company ever since. As a junior consultant I was trained as a commercial diver and led marine monitoring programs throughout Western Australia. Over the last decade, I have gained experience managing and implementing small to large coastal and offshore marine infrastructure projects in the energy, resources, ports and harbours sectors. Specific technical and project experience includes provision of State and Federal regulatory approvals advice, feasibility and environmental impact assessments, operational compliance monitoring, environmental audits and scope development. \n\nWhy did you choose UWA to do your MBA? \nI completed my undergrad at UWA and so I am probably biased. UWA does offer very flexible options for completing the MBA program but I was also interested in the access to premier guest speakers and social networking opportunities. \n\nWhat would be your advice to someone considering doing a UWA MBA?\nThere are several people in my office interested in completing an MBA. My advice is to enrol, it is by far the hardest part of the degree. You can always defer, but once you enrol you start to receive information and get a feel for the degree structure, and it just isn't as daunting anymore. Also, go to the information nights and ask questions. Everyone has similar apprehensions about starting post-graduate studies, which is refreshing.\nMatthew Clark-Massera\nBachelor of Electrical/Electronic Engineering, UWA\nOperations Manager, Digital Matter Pty Ltd \n \nPlease tell us about your career to date.  \nI joined Digital Matter (a GPS device manufacturer) in 2017 after completing my undergraduate at UWA. I began in the role of Technical Support Engineer, assisting clients with our products. Over my time, this role has grown to also include inventory management, becoming involved in the finance, as well as managing firmware, software and other engineering teams.\n \nWhy did you choose UWA to do your MBA?\nI thoroughly enjoyed my undergraduate experience and UWA and everything it had to offer – especially the university experience outside of the coursework. Coming back to UWA was natural, but also I believe UWA has a well regarded program internationally, so was a strong choice.\n \nWhat has been the most rewarding aspects of the UWA MBA so far? \nThe highly engaging workshops and seminars. These have helped me learn quickly and broadened my horizons. I am already applying new knowledge to my day-to-day life and work, half-way through my first unit! I have a fresh interest in business topics. As an engineer this is not something I thought I would enjoy quite as much as I have been – but the course content and delivery really makes it great fun to learn!\n• First Name\n• Family Name\n• Email\n• Remember me\n• By clicking on Sign up you agree to the Terms of Use\nSign up\n• Email Address\n• Recover your password\n• Email or Student ID\n• Password\n• Remember me\n• Log in\n• Help\nForgot password?\n• Enquire\n• Apply\n• clarifying career goals\n• strategies for effective job search\n• developing and reviewing resume\n• developing and reviewing cover letter\n• addressing selection criteria\n• strategies for networking (including social media strategies)\n• LinkedIn profile review\n• practising your pitch\n• improving job interview technique\n• considering job offers and negotiating salary\n• managing work and transitions\n• learn how to get noticed and match your ambitions to the right job opportunities.\n• Andrew Friars, Telco, Media, Energy and Utilities Sector Leader for IBM ANZ and Managing Partner for IBM Western Australian across all services\n• Meg O'Neill, Chief Executive Officer at Woodside Energy\n• Diane Smith-Gander AO, Chair at Zip Co, Chair of UWA Business School Advisory Board\n• Jimmy Wilson, Non-Executive Director and Deputy Chair of UWA Business School Board\n• Mining Leaders Scholarship: $15,000 per annum for students with an interest in the mining sector (MBA or MBA Flexible)\n• Paul Wilson Memorial Award: open to full-time MBA candidates and who have been employed as engineers or scientists in the mining industry (MBA)\n• UWA Indigenous Scholarship: all fees covered to encourage and assist high-achieving Indigenous candidates\n• Viburnum Funds MBA Career Acceleration Scholarship: a scholarship to assist and encourage high-achieving candidates who have taken a career break, due to parental or carer leave, and wish to accelerate their leadership careers by undertaking a Master of Business Administration at the University.\n• a personal statement of 1000 words detailing why you wish to undertake this course and drawing attention to the relevant aspects of your current and prospective employment which would benefit from completing the course.\n• a current curriculum vitae (CV).

Shortly after graduation I was offered a full-time position and have been with the company ever since. As a junior consultant I was trained as a commercial diver and led marine monitoring programs throughout Western Australia. Over the last decade, I have gained experience managing and implementing small to large coastal and offshore marine infrastructure projects in the energy, resources, ports and harbours sectors. Specific technical and project experience includes provision of State and Federal regulatory approvals advice, feasibility and environmental impact assessments, operational compliance monitoring, environmental audits and scope development. \n\nWhy did you choose UWA to do your MBA? \nI completed my undergrad at UWA and so I am probably biased. UWA does offer very flexible options for completing the MBA program but I was also interested in the access to premier guest speakers and social networking opportunities. \n\nWhat would be your advice to someone considering doing a UWA MBA?\nThere are several people in my office interested in completing an MBA. My advice is to enrol, it is by far the hardest part of the degree. You can always defer, but once you enrol you start to receive information and get a feel for the degree structure, and it just isn't as daunting anymore. Also, go to the information nights and ask questions. Everyone has similar apprehensions about starting post-graduate studies, which is refreshing. \n\n\nMatthew Clark-Massera\nBachelor of Electrical/Electronic Engineering, UWA\nOperations Manager, Digital Matter Pty Ltd \n \nPlease tell us about your career to date.  \nI joined Digital Matter (a GPS device manufacturer) in 2017 after completing my undergraduate at UWA. I began in the role of Technical Support Engineer, assisting clients with our products. Over my time, this role has grown to also include inventory management, becoming involved in the finance, as well as managing firmware, software and other engineering teams.\n \nWhy did you choose UWA to do your MBA?\nI thoroughly enjoyed my undergraduate experience and UWA and everything it had to offer – especially the university experience outside of the coursework. Coming back to UWA was natural, but also I believe UWA has a well regarded program internationally, so was a strong choice.\n \nWhat has been the most rewarding aspects of the UWA MBA so far? \nThe highly engaging workshops and seminars. These have helped me learn quickly and broadened my horizons. I am already applying new knowledge to my day-to-day life and work, half-way through my first unit! I have a fresh interest in business topics. As an engineer this is not something I thought I would enjoy quite as much as I have been – but the course content and delivery really makes it great fun to learn!\n[CARD]\nMeet our MBA students",
