Applicants able to demonstrate strong quantitative skills through their prior academic work and recent professional experiences may apply for admission to the Full-Time MBA without a GMAT or GRE test score. International applicants are strongly encouraged to submit an official GMAT or GRE test score as part of the application.\nShould I consider applying without a GMAT or GRE score? What factors make an applicant most competitive to submit an application without a GMAT or GRE score?\nApplying test optional is only recommended for applicants who meet the following criteria:\nHow can I demonstrate quantitative and program readiness if I’m applying without a GMAT or GRE score?\nApplicants considering applying without a GMAT or GRE should show:\nApplicants are reviewed on a holistic basis and all elements of the application including transcripts, resume, essays, recommendations, and interviews are considered in addition to the above mentioned criteria.\nMeeting the above criteria does not ensure admission to the Rady Full-Time MBA program. The MBA Admissions Committee may request that an applicant submits a GMAT or GRE score, or other information, as needed to evaluate preparedness for the program.\nWould it be helpful to submit a GMAT or GRE test score?\nThere are many cases in which we may encourage applicants to submit a test score, including:\nIf I have already reported a test score to the Rady School of Management for an application to the Full-Time MBA program, will it be used in the admissions process??\nYes, if you have already reported test scores, these scores will be reviewed and considered as part of your application for admission. If multiple test scores are submitted, your strongest score will be considered.\nWho do I contact if I have questions that are not addressed here about applying without a GMAT or GRE score?\nAll applicants who are considering applying without a GMAT or GRE test score should contact the Full-Time MBA Admissions Advisor to discuss your specific application.\nYes. Under the GMAT/GRE section on the application indicate when you are scheduled to take the exam. We will assemble your application and do a preliminary review while waiting for the results. No admission decision will be made until we have your GMAT/GRE scores and your application is complete.\nDemonstrated proficiency in the English language is required for all international applicants whose native language is not English. Students are eligible for a waiver if they have received at least a B average while studying full-time for one uninterrupted year at a university-level institution in which English is the language of instruction and in a country in which English is the dominant language. If an applicant is not eligible for a waiver, the applicant must demonstrate proficiency in the English language by taking and receiving passing scores on one of the below exams:\nThe Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL): The minimum TOEFL score for admission is 550 for the paper based test (PBT) or 80 for the internet based test (iBT). TOEFL information and forms are available at the TOEFL website.\nThe International English Language Testing System (IELTS) Academic Training exam: The minimum IELTS score is Band 7.0. IELTS registration information is available on the IELTS website.\nThe Pearson Test of English Academic (PTE Academic). The minimum PTE academic score required for graduate admission is overall score 65. Registration and test information is available on the Pearson website.\nOfficial academic records must be issued in the language of instruction and accompanied by official English translations. Acceptable documentation includes:\nRecommendations should generally be from your professional network — someone who knows you well enough to provide us with insight regarding your professional qualifications and potential for contribution. The most effective recommenders are those willing to speak on your behalf and supplement the application materials. Two recommendations are required; both do not need to be from your place of employment.\nThere is no automatic transfer to the Rady MBA. You must submit an application for admission consideration. Any transfer of credits would be on a case-by-case basis and generally, only a limited number of electives would be considered.\nEquivalency of a four-year U.S. bachelor’s degree is required. Thirty-six consecutive units of post-graduate, college-level courses taken prior to applying may fulfill the four-year requirement. Courses may be non-degree work.\nHaving prior post-undergraduate work experience is a critical aspect of your experience in the Full-Time MBA program at Rady.   We do comprehensively and holistically review applications for admission to our programs and will want to understand why now is the right time for you to pursue an MBA degree. Several factors are considered to determine your contribution to the class — professional experience, teamwork, leadership potential, excellent academic records, undergraduate internships, community work, extracurricular activities, etc. It is recommended that students gain 3-5 years of post-undergraduate professional experience before applying to our Full-Time MBA program.  Our Specialized Masters degrees are designed for students at an earlier stage in their career, including undergraduates who are continuing directly into a graduate program. To learn more about the graduate degree programs at the Rady School of Management, please connect with Admissions at one of the upcoming events.\nIt is not necessary to have business coursework prior to entering the MBA program — we are looking for a very diverse class. Majors have included computer science, engineering, chemistry, biology, sociology, literature, philosophy, political science, etc.\nThere is no minimum requirement; however, the average GMAT scores have been in the high 600s for the Full-Time MBA program. Details can be found in the class profile under your program of interest. GMAT scores are good predictors of how well students will do in the required core classes, and strong scores may serve to balance lower undergraduate academic performance. GMAT scores in one sitting are evaluated, not averaged from multiple sittings.\nThe Rady School welcomes applications from individuals who have already completed advanced study in science, engineering, medicine and technology. Deep knowledge of a scientific or technical field can, in combination with a rigorous MBA education focused on innovation, provide you with a launching pad for an exceptional career. Our student body, in both Full-Time and FlexMBA programs, includes unusually high numbers of people with advanced degrees. Please contact the Rady Graduate Admissions Office.\nYes, the admissions team recognizes the valuable leadership skills that applicants with military service can bring to the Rady School. Members of the military and veterans are strongly encouraged to apply. Please visit our Military section for more information. If you are interested in speaking to a current student or alumni with a military background, this can be arranged through the Rady Graduate Admissions Office.\nThere are mandatory minimum scores that are required by the UC San Diego’s Graduate Division. The university-wide minimum TOEFL score required for consideration for graduate admission is 550 for the paper based test (PBT), and 80 for the internet based test (iBT).\nThe university-wide minimum IELTS Academic Training exam score required for consideration for graduate admission is Band Score 7.\nThe minimum PTE Academic score required for graduate admission is Overall Score: 65.\nExplore by

Please contact Admissions at mba@rady.ucsd.edu for more information.\n\n\nWhat should I know about applying under the GMAT/GRE test optional policy?\n\n\nThe GMAT and GRE test score requirement is optional for applicants to Rady School of Management’s Full-Time MBA program. Applicants able to demonstrate strong quantitative skills through their prior academic work and recent professional experiences may apply for admission to the Full-Time MBA without a GMAT or GRE test score. International applicants are strongly encouraged to submit an official GMAT or GRE test score as part of the application.\nShould I consider applying without a GMAT or GRE score? What factors make an applicant most competitive to submit an application without a GMAT or GRE score?\nApplying test optional is only recommended for applicants who meet the following criteria:\n\nhave a four-year undergraduate degree from an accredited institution in the United States;\nhave a cumulative undergraduate GPA of 3.0 or higher;\nhave a minimum of 36 months of full-time post-undergraduate work experience by program start date;\nhave completed coursework in calculus, statistics, or other highly quantitative coursework at the undergraduate or graduate level and earned at least a B grade or higher.\n\n \nHow can I demonstrate quantitative and program readiness if I’m applying without a GMAT or GRE score?\nApplicants considering applying without a GMAT or GRE should show:\n\nstrong quantitative or analytical ability demonstrated throughout educational records, with a GPA at or above average as listed on the class profile;\nan undergraduate, masters, or other advanced degree in STEM or another quantitative focused major, with strong performance in multiple quantitative or analytical courses;\nclearly demonstrated quantitative or analytical professional work experience and/or professional certifications in quantitative-related fields (i.e. CPA, CFA, PE, etc.)\n\nApplicants are reviewed on a holistic basis and all elements of the application including transcripts, resume, essays, recommendations, and interviews are considered in addition to the above mentioned criteria.\nMeeting the above criteria does not ensure admission to the Rady Full-Time MBA program. The MBA Admissions Committee may request that an applicant submits a GMAT or GRE score, or other information, as needed to evaluate preparedness for the program.\n \nWould it be helpful to submit a GMAT or GRE test score?\nThere are many cases in which we may encourage applicants to submit a test score, including:\n\nIf you have an undergraduate GPA below the class average (as listed on the class profile). The GMAT or GRE may help demonstrate quantitative readiness or mitigate concerns regarding academic preparedness.\nThough recruiting practices vary, a strong GMAT or GRE score can be a consideration in finding employment. Employers in some industries, particularly finance, investment banking, and consulting, could request GMAT or GRE scores in their screening and hiring process.\nA strong standardized test score can strengthen your qualification for fellowships and scholarships.\n\n \nIf I have already reported a test score to the Rady School of Management for an application to the Full-Time MBA program, will it be used in the admissions process??\nYes, if you have already reported test scores, these scores will be reviewed and considered as part of your application for admission. If multiple test scores are submitted, your strongest score will be considered.\n \nWho do I contact if I have questions that are not addressed here about applying without a GMAT or GRE score?\nAll applicants who are considering applying without a GMAT or GRE test score should contact the Full-Time MBA Admissions Advisor to discuss your specific application.\n\n\nCan I submit my application before taking the GMAT/GRE?\n\n\nYes. Under the GMAT/GRE section on the application indicate when you are scheduled to take the exam. We will assemble your application and do a preliminary review while waiting for the results. No admission decision will be made until we have your GMAT/GRE scores and your application is complete.\n\n\nAm I required to submit a TOEFL score?\n\n\nDemonstrated proficiency in the English language is required for all international applicants whose native language is not English. Students are eligible for a waiver if they have received at least a B average while studying full-time for one uninterrupted year at a university-level institution in which English is the language of instruction and in a country in which English is the dominant language. If an applicant is not eligible for a waiver, the applicant must demonstrate proficiency in the English language by taking and receiving passing scores on one of the below exams:\nThe Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL): The minimum TOEFL score for admission is 550 for the paper based test (PBT) or 80 for the internet based test (iBT). TOEFL information and forms are available at the TOEFL website.\nThe International English Language Testing System (IELTS) Academic Training exam: The minimum IELTS score is Band 7.0. IELTS registration information is available on the IELTS website.\nThe Pearson Test of English Academic (PTE Academic). The minimum PTE academic score required for graduate admission is overall score 65. Registration and test information is available on the Pearson website.\n\n\nDo I need to submit a translated copy of my transcript?\n\n\nOfficial academic records must be issued in the language of instruction and accompanied by official English translations. Acceptable documentation includes:\n\nOriginals issued by the university bearing the original stamp or seal and the signature of the authorized official.\nOfficial copies issued by the degree granting university bearing the stamp or seal and signature of the authorized official.\nOfficial literal (word-for-word) English translations issued by the degree-granting institution or official authorized translation services.\n\n\n\nWho should my recommendation be from?\n\n\nRecommendations should generally be from your professional network — someone who knows you well enough to provide us with insight regarding your professional qualifications and potential for contribution. The most effective recommenders are those willing to speak on your behalf and supplement the application materials. Two recommendations are required; both do not need to be from your place of employment.\n\n\nI am enrolled in another MBA program — can I transfer to the Rady MBA program?\n\n\nThere is no automatic transfer to the Rady MBA. You must submit an application for admission consideration. Any transfer of credits would be on a case-by-case basis and generally, only a limited number of electives would be considered.\n\n\nCan I apply to multiple programs at the Rady School of Management at the same time?\n\n\nUC San Diego and the Rady School of Management permit only one submitted application at a time to any Rady School graduate degree programs.  If you’re unsure which program best aligns with your background and career goals, our admissions team is available to help you.  If you have started, submitted, or received an admissions decision from one program but decide to apply to another, please reach out to the admissions team for guidance.  If multiple applications are submitted at the same time, neither application will be reviewed until a first-choice preference is made by the applicant.\n\nPlease note that the application fee is nonrefundable. In cases where multiple applications are submitted, any fee paid for an application that is not reviewed will not be refunded.\n\n\nCan the application fee be waived?\n\n\nThe Rady School of Management does not offer application fee waivers upon request. Application fee waivers are made available to prospective applicants at select in-person and virtual recruitment events. Prospective students are advised to attend those admission events that are of interest to them.  Should it be pre-approved for an application fee waiver, attendees will be notified during the event.\n\nThe Rady School of Management is proud to offer pre-approval of application fee waivers to select populations, including active-duty and veteran members of the military; applicants affiliated with the Peace Corps, Teach for American, or AmeriCorps; SIEML and CaLI alumni; and MPAc Junior Applicants with approved Conditional Nomination.  Qualifying applicants should inform the Rady Graduate Admissions at RadyGradAdmissions@ucsd.edu prior to submitting their application for assistance with the fee waiver.\n\nApplication fees paid before an application fee waiver has been approved and/or applied will not be refunded.\n\n\n\n\nProgram Eligibility:\n\n\n\nMy bachelor's degree is from a 3-year program, am I still eligible to apply?\n\n\nEquivalency of a four-year U.S. bachelor’s degree is required. Thirty-six consecutive units of post-graduate, college-level courses taken prior to applying may fulfill the four-year requirement. Courses may be non-degree work.\n\n\nI will complete my bachelor’s degree in the spring and will not have any professional work experience. Will you consider my application for admission to the Full-Time MBA?\n\n\nHaving prior post-undergraduate work experience is a critical aspect of your experience in the Full-Time MBA program at Rady.   We do comprehensively and holistically review applications for admission to our programs and will want to understand why now is the right time for you to pursue an MBA degree. Several factors are considered to determine your contribution to the class — professional experience, teamwork, leadership potential, excellent academic records, undergraduate internships, community work, extracurricular activities, etc. It is recommended that students gain 3-5 years of post-undergraduate professional experience before applying to our Full-Time MBA program.  Our Specialized Masters degrees are designed for students at an earlier stage in their career, including undergraduates who are continuing directly into a graduate program. To learn more about the graduate degree programs at the Rady School of Management, please connect with Admissions at one of the upcoming events.   \n\n\nDo I need a business background to apply to the program?\n\n\nIt is not necessary to have business coursework prior to entering the MBA program — we are looking for a very diverse class. Majors have included computer science, engineering, chemistry, biology, sociology, literature, philosophy, political science, etc.\n\n\nWhat is the minimum GMAT score for the Rady MBA program?\n\n\nThere is no minimum requirement; however, the average GMAT scores have been in the high 600s for the Full-Time MBA program. Details can be found in the class profile under your program of interest. GMAT scores are good predictors of how well students will do in the required core classes, and strong scores may serve to balance lower undergraduate academic performance. GMAT scores in one sitting are evaluated, not averaged from multiple sittings.\n\n\nDoes the Rady School accept students with advanced degrees?\n\n\nThe Rady School welcomes applications from individuals who have already completed advanced study in science, engineering, medicine and technology. Deep knowledge of a scientific or technical field can, in combination with a rigorous MBA education focused on innovation, provide you with a launching pad for an exceptional career. Our student body, in both Full-Time and FlexMBA programs, includes unusually high numbers of people with advanced degrees. Please contact the Rady Graduate Admissions Office.\n\n\nDoes the Rady School view military service as relevant work experience?\n\n\nYes, the admissions team recognizes the valuable leadership skills that applicants with military service can bring to the Rady School. Members of the military and veterans are strongly encouraged to apply. Please visit our Military section for more information. If you are interested in speaking to a current student or alumni with a military background, this can be arranged through the Rady Graduate Admissions Office.\n\n\nAre there minimum requirements for language exams for international students?\n\n\nThere are mandatory minimum scores that are required by the UC San Diego’s Graduate Division. The university-wide minimum TOEFL score required for consideration for graduate admission is 550 for the paper based test (PBT), and 80 for the internet based test (iBT).\nThe university-wide minimum IELTS Academic Training exam score required for consideration for graduate admission is Band Score 7.\nThe minimum PTE Academic score required for graduate admission is Overall Score: 65.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPROGRAMS\nExplore by Program\nFull-Time MBA\nPart-Time MBA (FlexEvening)\nExecutive MBA\nMaster of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA)\nMaster of Professional Accountancy (MPAc)\nMaster of Quantitative Finance (MQF)\nPh.D.\nUndergraduate Programs\nExecutive Education\n\n\nINFO FOR\nCurrent Students\nStaff\nDonors & Investors\nMilitary/Veterans\nCompanies and Recruiters\nPress\nAlumni\n\n\nCONTACT\nContact Admissions\nSchedule a Visit\nUpcoming Events\nRequest Information\nTake a Virtual Tour\nMaps & Directions\nPartner with Rady\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\nApply Give\n\nAnnual Security and Fire Safety Report\nOpen Staff Positions\nPROGRAMS\nExplore by Program\nFull-Time MBA\nPart-Time MBA (FlexEvening)\nExecutive MBA\nMaster of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA)\nMaster of Professional Accountancy (MPAc)\nMaster of Quantitative Finance (MQF)\nPh.D.\nUndergraduate Programs\nExecutive Education\nINFO FOR\nCurrent Students\nStaff\nDonors & Investors\nMilitary/Veterans\nCompanies and Recruiters\nPress\nAlumni\nCONTACT\nContact Admissions\nSchedule a Visit\nUpcoming Events\nRequest Information\nTake a Virtual Tour\nMaps & Directions\nPartner with Rady\nFull-Time MBA\n\n\n\n\n                Stats & Stories\n            \n\n\n\n                Academics\n            \n\n\n\n                Career Impact\n            \n\n\n\n                Student Experience\n            \n\n\n\n                Admissions\n            \n\n\n\n                Tuition & Aid\n            \n\n\n                    Program FAQs\n            \n\n\n                Request Information\n            \n\n\n\n                Apply\nAcademics\nAdmissions\n[GRID_TABLE]\nPROGRAMS\nExplore by Program\nFull-Time MBA\nPart-Time MBA (FlexEvening)\nExecutive MBA\nMaster of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA)\nMaster of Professional Accountancy (MPAc)\nMaster of Quantitative Finance (MQF)\nPh.D.\nUndergraduate Programs\nExecutive Education\nINFO FOR\nCurrent Students\nStaff\nDonors & Investors\nMilitary/Veterans\nCompanies and Recruiters\nPress\nAlumni\nCONTACT\nContact Admissions\nSchedule a Visit\nUpcoming Events\nRequest Information\nTake a Virtual Tour\nMaps & Directions\nPartner with Rady\n[GRID_TABLE]\nAcademics\nAdmissions",

The Rady Admissions team takes a holistic approach to reviewing all applicants and in recruiting a cohort that reflects academic excellence, innovation, diverse perspectives and hard work. We encourage you to explore the application process, meet our advisors, and to take the time to put together a high quality application that reflects you and your career aspirations. Post-undergraduate work experience is an important aspect of the Full-Time MBA application; the program is designed for students with three to five years of work experience. This is your opportunity to invest in yourself and make the impact you want to have on the world.\nBeginning with the Fall 2023 admissions cycle, all admitted, international applicants are required to complete and submit a WES Course-by-Course evaluation. Please go to wes.org to create your account. You will be prompted to input your academic history, and will then be provided with a list of documents required for the completion of your evaluation. Applicants with academic work in progress who expect to complete a degree program before the intended date of enrollment at UCSD must provide evidence of degree conferral and a final academic transcript as soon as they are available.\nPlease do not send official documents to the Graduate Admissions Office. As an international applicant, you must submit a WES Course-by-Course evaluation via WES once you have been admitted for your admission to UC San Diego to be finalized.\nYour resume should highlight the professional and extracurricular activities that make you a good candidate for the Full Time MBA program. Resume length should not exceed 1 page.Resume Template\nWe require two letters of recommendation. Your recommenders should provide specific examples of your performance and contributions to an organization. One of these letters should be from a current supervisor or manager; however, if you are unable to ask your current supervisor, please use the optional essay to explain why. Your recommenders will be sent a personalized link to complete your recommendation. PLEASE NOTE: an application will not be considered complete until both recommenders have submitted their letters.\nWe require one written essay:\nFrom your resume, we understand your career path and experience to date. Please share your specific career goals for both your internship and long-term plans after graduation (consider including function, industry, and companies of interest). What gaps or areas of development do you need to address to achieve these goals? Additionally, what specific opportunities and resources within the Rady MBA program will you pursue to bridge these gaps and ensure a successful career outcome? (PDF only. 500 words or less.)\nOptional Essay:\nThis is an opportunity to address a GPA below 3.0 from your undergraduate institution, explain an employment gap of 3 months or more and provide any additional information you feel would be helpful for the admissions committee as we make our decisions. Do not use the optional essay to provide additional content to address the required essay. (PDF only. 250 words or less.)\nVideo Essay:\nAdditionally, you will be required to upload a 1-minute video introducing yourself to the Admissions Committee.\nOur Full-Time MBA application is test optional. However, if you do not meet the criteria below, a competitive score on the GMAT or GRE can provide additional evidence showing preparedness for the quantitative rigor of the program.\nIf you are considering submitting a test score, please refer to our class profile for the average GMAT & GRE scores.\nIELTS scores are to be sent directly from the British Council or test-taking institution. The minimum IELTS score is 7. Select University of California, San Diego as the institution and have scores released electronically to Rady/ UC San Diego.\nPTE test takers must select the University of California, San Diego as a score recipient, then submit a copy of your scores directly to our Graduate Admissions office at: Rady School of Management, UC San Diego, 9500 Gilman Drive #0553, La Jolla, CA 92093-0553. Include your registration ID number and exam date on your application. Official scores will be verified online. The minimum PTE score is 65.\nDemonstrated proficiency in the English language is required for all international applicants whose native language is not English. Non-native English language speakers may be exempt from this requirement if they have earned or will be earning a bachelor's, master's, or doctoral degree with grades of B (3.0) or better from either:\nFellowships are available for each program and are awarded to the most qualified applicants in terms of merit and alignment with the mission of the institution. Applicants are automatically reviewed for fellowship by the Admissions Committee when an admissions decision has been reached.\nThe application fee is $200 for both domestic and international MBA applicants.\nThe non-refundable fee is payable by credit card through the online application upon submission of your application.\nPLEASE NOTE: an application will not be considered complete until the application fee is paid.\nThe Rady School admissions team works quickly to review your application, giving you time to make the right decision for your MBA studies. Applications are reviewed as they are received and decisions made on a rolling basis after Round 1. After you submit your application, you will receive confirmation and instructions for further action, if necessary. Once you have submitted a complete application, it will be reviewed to determine if the admissions committee would like to schedule an interview. Interviews are required for admission, are by invitation only and are scheduled via Zoom.\nIf you have questions about the application process, please contact the Rady Admissions Office.\nREADY TO

Please go to wes.org to create your account. You will be prompted to input your academic history, and will then be provided with a list of documents required for the completion of your evaluation. Applicants with academic work in progress who expect to complete a degree program before the intended date of enrollment at UCSD must provide evidence of degree conferral and a final academic transcript as soon as they are available.\nPlease do not send official documents to the Graduate Admissions Office. As an international applicant, you must submit a WES Course-by-Course evaluation via WES once you have been admitted for your admission to UC San Diego to be finalized.\n\n\nResume or CV\n\n\nYour resume should highlight the professional and extracurricular activities that make you a good candidate for the Full Time MBA program. Resume length should not exceed 1 page.Resume Template\n\n\nRecommendations\n\n\nWe require two letters of recommendation. Your recommenders should provide specific examples of your performance and contributions to an organization. One of these letters should be from a current supervisor or manager; however, if you are unable to ask your current supervisor, please use the optional essay to explain why. Your recommenders will be sent a personalized link to complete your recommendation. PLEASE NOTE: an application will not be considered complete until both recommenders have submitted their letters.\n\n\nEssay Questions\n\n\nWe require one written essay:\nFrom your resume, we understand your career path and experience to date. Please share your specific career goals for both your internship and long-term plans after graduation (consider including function, industry, and companies of interest). What gaps or areas of development do you need to address to achieve these goals? Additionally, what specific opportunities and resources within the Rady MBA program will you pursue to bridge these gaps and ensure a successful career outcome? (PDF only. 500 words or less.)\nOptional Essay:\nThis is an opportunity to address a GPA below 3.0 from your undergraduate institution, explain an employment gap of 3 months or more and provide any additional information you feel would be helpful for the admissions committee as we make our decisions. Do not use the optional essay to provide additional content to address the required essay. (PDF only. 250 words or less.)\nVideo Essay:\nAdditionally, you will be required to upload a 1-minute video introducing yourself to the Admissions Committee.\n\n\nGMAT or GRE Scores\n\n\nOur Full-Time MBA application is test optional. However, if you do not meet the criteria below, a competitive score on the GMAT or GRE can provide additional evidence showing preparedness for the quantitative rigor of the program.\n\nhave a four-year undergraduate degree from an accredited institution in the United States;\nhave a cumulative undergraduate GPA of 3.0 or higher;\nhave a minimum of 36 months of full-time post-undergraduate work experience by program start date;\nhave completed coursework in calculus, statistics, or other highly quantitative coursework at the undergraduate or graduate level and earned at least a B grade or higher.\n\nIf you are considering submitting a test score, please refer to our class profile for the average GMAT & GRE scores.\n\n\nTOEFL, IELTS or PTE Score (for international applicants only)\n\n\nTOEFL scores are to be sent from ETS to institutional code 4836.

The minimum PTE score is 65.\nDemonstrated proficiency in the English language is required for all international applicants whose native language is not English. Non-native English language speakers may be exempt from this requirement if they have earned or will be earning a bachelor's, master's, or doctoral degree with grades of B (3.0) or better from either:\n\nA regionally accredited U.S. college or university where English is the sole language of instruction, or\nA foreign college or university which provides instruction solely in English. You may verify whether your institution meets this requirement by looking up your institution in the IAU World Higher Education Database (WHED). If English is not the sole language of instruction listed, if no language is listed at all, or if the institution does not appear on the WHED website, you are required to submit English proficiency exam scores. No other documentation (e.g. letters, language certificates, school websites) may be used in place of WHED as a means to obtain an exemption from the English proficiency requirement. \n\n\n\nFellowship Request\n\n\nFellowships are available for each program and are awarded to the most qualified applicants in terms of merit and alignment with the mission of the institution. Applicants are automatically reviewed for fellowship by the Admissions Committee when an admissions decision has been reached.\n\n\nApplication Fee\n\n\nThe application fee is $200 for both domestic and international MBA applicants.\nThe non-refundable fee is payable by credit card through the online application upon submission of your application.\nPLEASE NOTE: an application will not be considered complete until the application fee is paid.\n\n\n\nAfter You Apply\nThe Rady School admissions team works quickly to review your application, giving you time to make the right decision for your MBA studies.

Rady faculty are prominent scholars in the fields of finance, behavioral economics, innovation, technology and operations management, marketing, organizational strategy and psychology. The curriculum is designed to be extensive, flexible and personalized, in a self-directed research environment.\nThe Rady Ph.D. program builds upon UC San Diego’s reputation and lineage, which includes 16 Nobel Laureates (former and current faculty) and eight MacArthur Foundation award recipients. We invite you to discuss the opportunities offered by the Rady program with our expert faculty.\nIf you have any questions, please contact the Rady Ph.D. Graduate Coordinator at radyphd@ucsd.edu.\nData from the AACSB indicates that the U.S. shortage of business Ph.D.s is expected to be over 1,000 in five years and nearly 2,500 in 10 years, both in the academic and corporate fields. Graduates with the right background, motivation, ability and training have the opportunity to become the next generation of professors at the world's elite business schools.\nThe Rady Ph.D. program combines faculty expertise, intimate size, strong interdisciplinary training and a desirable location for highly qualified doctoral candidates. The program has a strong research orientation, along with personal attention and mentoring from world-class faculty.\nThe program is a full-time course of study, designed primarily to prepare candidates for an academic career. Students begin active research at an early stage, working with faculty mentors throughout the program. Most students take four to five years to complete degree requirements and defend their dissertation (depending on the student’s background and progress). Academic and research interests include finance, marketing, management, economics and strategy, and innovation, technology and operations.\nThe mission of the Rady School of Management’s Ph.D. program is to graduate intellectually rigorous and innovative researchers. Our Ph.D. program is committed to preparing scholars and professors for the world’s leading universities.\nExplore by Program\nFull-Time MBA\nPart-Time MBA (FlexEvening)\nExecutive MBA\nMaster of
