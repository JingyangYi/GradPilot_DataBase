Housing\nPeking University is located in the Haidian District near to the North West 4th Ring Road. It can easily be reached by subway line 4 at Beidadongmen Station or line 13 at Wudaokou Station. Therefore, it is good to find an apartment near to the subway line.\nA 2-bedroom apartment may cost you USD 900-1200 per month. All BiMBA students live off campus and most of them share a two-bedroom or three-bedroom apartment, taking into consideration of the lower cost, better housing conditions and easier access to community facilities, such as bars, book stores, restaurants, shopping malls and places of interests. Besides, most of them think it is exciting to experience life in Beijing as local people do. International students can apply to live in the PKU's international students' apartment (USD 500 per month for one bedroom of a two-room apartment).\nBiMBA staff will help students get information on housing. However, students themselves need to look at possible places of residence and sign contracts with real estate agents.\n\t \n\n\t2. Eating\nStudents eat on campus using their food card mostly; the cost of three meals a day is about US$ 3.5-4. There are many choices of food in Beijing, both Eastern and Western. Eating in restaurants may cost US$ 7.5-10 per person – or more.\n\t \n\n\t3. Public Transportation\nTaxis are widely available in Beijing and they are extremely cheap compared to most cities in the world. Most rides vary from US$ 2 to 5. From the airport to the Peking University Campus (about 40 km) you might expect to pay around US$ 19.\nCurrently, Beijing runs 18 subway lines and the closest station to Peking University being “Beidadongmen” (East Gate of Peking University) which is on Line 4. There’s also an upground railway line in the city - Line 13; the closest station to Peking University on this line is “Wudaokou”.

These entry requirements apply to all our Teacher Training PGCE courses.\nA first or second-class UK Bachelor’s degree in an appropriate subject, or an overseas qualification of an equivalent standard from a recognised higher education institution is normally required.\nCandidates who are judged not to have sufficient subject knowledge for certain secondary PGCE courses may be required to undertake a Subject Knowledge Enhancement (SKE) course. The length of SKE varies depending on the need of the individual – from eight-week ‘refresher’ or ‘booster’ courses, through to more extensive 36-week courses.\nFor some courses, applicants whose degree qualifications are lower than 2:2 standard may be admitted if they can demonstrate an appropriate academic background at master’s level and above and/or significant postgraduate experience in the relevant field.\nPlease note that we will not consider applicants to any Initial Teacher Education (ITE) programmes that already hold the professional teaching qualification that the intended UCL PGCE programme leads to - QTS, QTLS, EYTS. For example, an applicant who already holds Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) is ineligible to apply for any ITE course that leads to QTS.\nFor all courses, a GCSE, or comparable qualification, at grade C or 4 is required in English Language and Mathematics.\nFor Primary education, (pupils aged 3–11) and Early Years Initial Teacher Training (EYITT) working with children aged 0-5; a GCSE grade C or 4 is also required in a science subject (we do not accept Additional Science or Applied Science). Please note that the PGCE Primary (Specialist Mathematics) course requires a GCSE grade 5 in Mathematics.\nWe do not accept English taught as a second language or English Literature to meet our GCSE English Language requirements.\nWe do not accept BTEC, functional skills or Access qualifications in place of GCSEs.\nApplicants who do not offer a GCSE in English Language or Mathematics at grade 4 may demonstrate an equivalent standard by completing either the Mathematics Foundation, Mathematics Higher or English from Equivalency Testing or A Star Equivalency and achieve at least a grade 4.\nFor GCSE Science we will accept either Combined Science or Biology taken with one of these providers.\nIf you are made an offer you will be required to successfully complete Occupational Health and Disclosure Barring Service (DBS) Enhanced Disclosure checks.\nFrom October 2024, the Occupational Health Check is £100 and, depending on your DBS requirements, there may be an additional fee between £12.75 to £25.50, depending on the number of documents checked, if you submit your DBS Enhanced Disclosure check via a UK Post Office.\nAll teacher training candidates who are offered a place at UCL must be certified as meeting national requirements for physical and mental fitness to teach, as set by the Department for Education.

Tuition fees are subject to an annual increase of up to 5% annually (except for Overseas UG fees and all PG Taught fees which are now fixed at the rate at entry), which should be accounted for when you are applying for a programme.\nFees are normally quoted at the full-time rate, except where the programme is offered part-time or modular/flexible only. Fees for part-time or modular study are normally charged pro-rata to the appropriate full-time Master's fee taken in an academic session.

Most fees are quoted in UK Pounds but some are in other currencies.\nDetails about fees for individual programmes can be found on the specific programme information pages.\nResearch programmes at UCL may be subject to an Additional Fee Element (AFE). The AFE is applied to cover additional costs related to consumables, equipment and materials and other items (excluding student visas) which are not included in the composite tuition fee listed in the fees schedule and is, therefore, applied to a minority of programmes.\nAs each PhD programme is unique in its nature, the AFE is calculated on a student by student basis and is determined by the supervisor. The AFE is banded into four fixed amounts: £1,000, £2,500, £5,000 and £10,000, with one further band for variable sums over £10,000. Please contact your supervisor directly for advice on whether or not your programme will incur an AFE. Please note that you will be informed in your offer letter of any AFE you will be required to pay.\nAt some UK institutions the AFE may be referred to as bench fees.\nThe level of tuition fee charged will also depend on whether you are classified as a UK or Overseas student. It is likely that you will already know into which category you will fall, but this will be confirmed if you are offered a place to study at UCL. Your fee classification plays no part in deciding whether or not to offer you a place to study at UCL.\nEach student's fee classification is determined in accordance with the 2007 Education (Fees and Awards) (England) Regulations (SI No. 779) and subsequent amendments, and is based upon information that you have provided on your application.\nFor full-time and part-time students your tuition fee will normally be quoted on your offer letter. For flexible/modular students, fees will be assessed according to the number of credits selected, therefore a fee will not be quoted on your offer letter.\nYou must pay at least 1/3 of your tuition fee before or at enrolment to be fully enrolled, or provide a letter of sponsorship indicating who should be invoiced for your fee.\nStudents can pay in three equal instalments; the first before or at enrolment, the second by 7 February and the third by 2 May. No charge is made for paying in instalments, and no more than three instalments are permitted.

Once a successful applicant is enrolled on their programme of study, the deposit will form part of the total tuition fee, as quoted on the offer of admission.\nPlease note that the required tuition fee deposit must be paid in full by the deadline specified in the offer of admission, which will usually be no earlier than 1 April for entry the following September.\nSome programmes will have earlier deadlines and you should consult your offer letter for the deadline which applies to you.\nPlease take time to read UCL's tuition fee deposit policy.
