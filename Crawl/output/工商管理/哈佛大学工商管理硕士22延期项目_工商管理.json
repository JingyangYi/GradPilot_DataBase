Employees within these companies engage with customers, create products and services, and manage staff.)\nEntrepreneurship (including founding an organization or joining an early-stage start-up.)\nTechnically-demanding roles (e.g. engineering, software development, scientific research, and medical functions. These roles typically require a high level of specialized knowledge, skills, and expertise in a particular field.)\nAre you in your final year of study?\nThe 2+2 Application mirrors the MBA Application but has its own deadline.\nThis school gives you the opportunity to pursue whatever that big dream is, you just have to have the courage to dream big.\nReady to Apply?\nStart your application.\n• Applicants from lower socio-economic backgrounds.\n• Applicants who are the first in their family to attend college.\n• Applicants who are planning to work in underrepresented industries and functions, such as:Operating companies (e.g. consumer goods, industrials, manufacturing, retail, and technology.

Accept Your Offer\n[HEADING] Ready to Apply?\nThe 2+2 program is a deferred admission process for current students, either in college or full-time master’s degree programs.\n2+2 is comprised of at least two years of professional work experience followed by two years in the regular Harvard Business School (HBS) MBA Program. We’re looking for innovative thinkers who have demonstrated leadership and analytical skills and want to develop their knowledge and passion to make a difference in the world. After being admitted through 2+2, students spend a minimum of two years (maximum of four years) working in a professional position in the public, private, or nonprofit sector before enrolling at HBS.\nIf you are in your final year of study, you are eligible to apply in the current application cycle. You must graduate from your program between October 1, 2025 and September 30, 2026.\nUndergraduates in their final year of study are eligible to apply.\nCandidates in joint bachelor/master’s degree programs are eligible to apply.\nCandidates from master’s degree programs who have not held a full-time work position (other than internships or co-ops) are eligible to apply. To be eligible for the 2+2 program, candidates need to have gone directly from undergraduate to graduate school.\nStudents enrolled in PhD programs, law school, or medical school are not eligible for the 2+2 program; instead these students should apply through the regular admissions process.\nWe have several resources to help you get to know 2+2 and HBS better!\nJoin us for various virtual college events by registering on the Events page.\nHear from HBS students and alumni about their 2+2 experience on the MBA Voices Blog.\nSee 2+2 program section on the Frequently Asked Questions page for responses to frequently asked questions\nFor applicants to the 2+2 Deferred Admission Program, a valid GMAT or GRE score is required. If you are an international applicant attending a non-English speaking undergraduate university, you will also need to submit results from an English Language Test. See Application Process for more details.\nThe 2026 application for 2+2 deferred applicants will open in December 2025.\nAll applications and recommendations must be submitted online. 2+2 applications have only one deadline. Applications are not reviewed on a rolling basis so your application will not be considered until the application deadline.\nApplicants to our 2+2 program have a reduced application fee of $100 USD. If the application fee presents a financial burden, we invite you to request a need-based application fee waiver. All active-duty military applicants do not have to pay the application fee. Details on how to request the military fee waiver and the need-based application fee waiver are in the 2+2 application.\nList of Application Materials\nIf you are admitted into HBS through the 2+2 program and want to confirm your future matriculation: you will pay a non-refundable $1,000 USD tuition deposit and withdraw applications from all other MBA programs (including deferral programs). You are required to gain two years of professional work experience in an HBS-approved position before matriculating. In many cases, we allow 2+2 admits to defer for three or four years in an HBS-approved professional work opportunity before matriculating (approvals are offered on a case-by-case basis). In accepting your 2+2 admissions offer, you also agree not to apply to additional MBA programs during your deferral period.\nPlease email applytech@hbs.edu with any questions.\nReady to Apply?\nStart your application.\n• Join us for various virtual college events by registering on the Events page.\n• Hear from HBS students and alumni about their 2+2 experience on the MBA Voices Blog.\n• See 2+2 program section on the Frequently Asked Questions page for responses to frequently asked questions",

We are looking for future leaders who are passionate about business, leadership, and growth.\nHere you will find a detailed explanation of our MBA application process and requirements. We look forward to learning about you through your application.\nTo apply to Harvard Business School, we ask you to assemble and prepare a variety of materials that will help us assess your qualifications. Remember, all materials must be submitted to HBS online by the application deadlines. The following serves as a preview of what you need to prepare.\nTranscripts\nEnglish Language Test\nEssays (2+2 Deferred Applicants)\nRecommendations\nFee or Fee Waiver\nAcceptance of Policies\nAfter your written application has been submitted and reviewed, you may be invited to interview. Interviews are 30 minutes and are conducted by an MBA Admissions Board member who has reviewed your application. Your interview will be tailored to you and is designed for us to learn more about you in the context of a conversation.\nThe interview is a positive indicator of interest, but is not a guarantee of admission; it serves as one element among many that are considered as we complete a final review of your candidacy. All interviews are conducted by invitation only, at the discretion of the Admissions Board. If invited, however, you must participate in order to complete the application process.\nInterviews may be scheduled on campus, in domestic or international hub cities, or via Zoom. Neither the timing of your interview invitation nor its format, whether in person or via Zoom, implies anything about the status of your application or affects your candidacy.\nWithin 24 hours of the interview, candidates are required to submit a written reflection through our online application system. Detailed instructions will be provided to those applicants who are invited to interview.\n2+2 Deferred Admission\nEvery HBS MBA student has been where you are right now.

Accounting research uses statistical and econometric methods and theoretical economic modeling, and often draws from frameworks developed in information and financial economics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness Economics \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe doctoral program in Business Economics, which includes Finance and Applied Economics tracks, provides scholars with rigorous training in economic theory and a particular focus on economic analysis as it applies to the business world.

Coursework includes the study of microeconomics theory, management, research methods, and statistics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarketing \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarketing scholars explore processes by which goods, services, and information are exchanged. Research provides insights into how companies serve customers and approaches for measuring the impact of marketing efforts.  Marketing PhDs are separated into two broad sub-fields: quantitative marketing and consumer behavior. Theoretical modeling within quantitative marketing borrows from computer science, microeconomics, and statistics to offer guidelines for a firm’s marketing strategies. Experimental work in consumer behavior aims to understand the psychological and social motivations behind individuals’ responses to various stimuli.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganizational Behavior \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScholars in the PhD program in Organizational Behavior draw on methods from psychology and sociology to examine organizations and how people behave within them. The program offers two tracks: either a micro or macro approach. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrategy \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearchers in strategy seek to understand the mechanisms through which firms create value and sustain performance over time. Strategy scholars develop a foundation in microeconomics and econometrics, and may supplement their understanding with additional economics topics—such as industrial organization, contract theory, or development economics—or extend to another discipline such as sociology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnology & Operations Management \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnology and Operations Management scholars examine how and why firms create innovative products and services, how they translate goals into action, and how the spread of technology generates growth and transforms society. Theoretical modeling uses mathematical programming and computer science techniques to examine and improve firm performance. Innovation research draws on economics, strategy, and entrepreneurship and employs a range of quantitative and qualitative methods.\nPhD Programs\nOur PhD students draw on diverse personal and professional backgrounds to pursue an\n                  ever-expanding range of research topics.
