Pairing an MBA with an M.D. degree gives students a unique blend of skills to advance their careers. M.D./MBAs are able to complete their MBA in one year while enrolled in the M.D. program.\nStudents who are enrolled in the M.D. program at the Morehouse School of Medicine are eligible to apply to the Full-time MBA program and should plan to apply prior to the end of their third year in the M.D. program.\nMorehouse School of Medicine students must apply to and be accepted by the MBA Admissions Office.\nM.D./MBA students take 39 credit hours at Scheller and transfer 15 credits of specific courses from the M.D. program at the Morehouse School of Medicine to complete the 54 credits of the MBA curriculum at Scheller. With a higher course load per semester than those who pursue a single degree, students can complete both the M.D. and the MBA degrees in five years.\nDuring the first three years, students will take M.D. courses at Morehouse School of Medicine. During the fourth year, students will take 39 credit hours of MBA courses at Scheller.\nSummer semester\n* Students can choose to take MGT 6510 in the spring semester\nMSM M.D. students can apply by any of the Full-time MBA deadlines. However, applying in Rounds 1 or 2 maximizes an applicant's consideration for merit-based scholarships.\nAdmission to the Full-time MBA program is competitive and will depend on academic background, career goals, fit with the MBA program, test scores, application essays, and leadership potential. In addition to submitting the standard online MBA application, the MBA admissions process will include an in-person interview. MSM M.D. students may submit MCAT scores (in lieu of GMAT/GRE scores) for admission.\nM.D./MBA Special Application Instructions:\nMSM M.D./MBA students will be enrolled at Georgia Tech during their fourth year and will pay the applicable Full-time MBA tuition and fees to Georgia Tech for that academic year.\nThe cost includes 12+ credit hours per semester for the academic year. The academic year includes Fall and Spring semesters. During the Summer semester, students will pay the Full-time MBA per credit hour rate for the remaining six credits.\nDuring the first three years of the M.D. program, students will be enrolled at Morehouse School of Medicine and will not be enrolled at Scheller.\nScheller offers a variety of funding opportunities for the MBA program. Submitting the official MBA application by the Round 1 or Round 2 deadlines maximizes an applicant's chances for consideration of merit-based scholarships.\nThis website uses cookies.

If you are unable to find the answer to a specific question or wish to speak with someone directly regarding other questions, feel free to contact us online or call 404.385.2254. To read more about MBA programs check out our Why an MBA resources.\nThe Executive MBA (EMBA) format is designed for working professionals with a minimum of five years of progressive career experience. You do not have to be at an executive level to participate in the EMBA program. Our EMBA students average 10 - 15 years of work experience and are seeking a MBA that specifically focuses on the knowledge and skill sets they need to advance their careers or move into new career paths.\nThe EMBA format also offers a more enhanced level of service than most MBA programs. As a student, you gain access to a program team that handles administrative tasks and provides support during your onboarding process and throughout your 17 months as a student.\nEMBA students move through the program as a cohort, beginning the 17-month program with a weeklong residency at Georgia Tech. Students then attend classes approximately two to three weekends a month on select Friday evenings (5:30 - 9:30 p.m.) and Saturdays (8:30 a.m. - 5:30 p.m.) for the duration of the program. There are no Sunday classes. There is an additional on-campus weeklong residency in December of the first semester and a mandatory two-week international residency.\nExecutive, Evening, and Full-time MBA designations refer to the format of the classes/program, not to the MBA degree itself. It is important to note that students who enroll in the Executive MBA program earn MBA degrees, not “Executive MBA” degrees. Upon completion of the Executive MBA program, students are awarded either an “MBA - Global Business” degree or an “MBA - Management of Technology” degree, depending on which degree specialty they select.\nBoth programs share a core MBA curriculum that all EMBA students, regardless of program specialty, must complete.\nGlobal Business (Leadership)\nThe Global Business (Leadership) specialization teaches you to think strategically and contribute to companies that work across borders and around the world. After the EMBA core, Global Business (Leadership) transitions to a specialized curriculum focusing on the dynamics of global competition and strategies for building a global competitive advantage.\nThe Global Strategy Project is the program's capstone experience – where you and your capstone team will work with a company to address an actual issue on a global scale. You’ll identify opportunities and make recommendations on how to implement strategies internationally, from product and pricing to procurement, logistics, and management. Learn more about the Global Business (Leadership) specialization.\nManagement of Technology (Innovation, Entrepreneurship, and Intrapreneurship)\nThe Management of Technology (Innovation, Entrepreneurship, and Intrapreneurship) specialization teaches you to forecast and embrace emerging technologies, all while managing innovation and organizational change.\nThe Management of Technology Project is the program's capstone project. As a member of a select team, you’ll choose an emerging technology and complete a full business plan, demonstrating your understanding of how to take a technology-driven product or service to market. This powerful integrative experience concludes with a juried business plan competition. Learn more about the Management of Technology (Innovation, Entrepreneurship, and Intrapreneurship) specialization.\nClasses are held in the state-of-the-art Huang Executive Education Center in the Scheller College of Business, located at the corner of West Peachtree Street and Fifth Street in Technology Square, Midtown Atlanta.\nQualified candidates have several years of professional work experience (a minimum of five years is required) with a history of professional advancement and leadership. Students' personal and professional backgrounds vary, bringing diversity to the classroom experience.\nOur Executive MBA students report an average 20% salary increase from program start to graduation.\nNo. Though many students reside in Georgia, some students commute from other states. Travel expenses and accommodations for the domestic residencies and classes are not included in the cost of the program, but we will gladly provide you with a list of local lodging options.\nEach degree program has approximately 70 - 80 students per cohort.\nStudents visit businesses and educational institutions in established and emerging economies during the international residency.  You’ll examine the cultural, legal, and economic aspects of each location you visit, gaining deeper, firsthand knowledge of international business practices and cultures. Ultimately, you’ll gain an understanding of the country’s economy and how to effectively conduct business there.\nGlobal Business (Leadership) students also have the opportunity to participate in an optional second international residency.\nDepending on which of our two degrees you pursue, you will receive one of the following:\nOn average, students spend between 10 and 20 hours per week on assignments outside of class. This number will vary based on how familiar you are with the courses taught in a given semester.\nAt this time, we do not offer this program online.\nEach cohort begins in August and graduates the following December.\nYes, you will have access to all student resources. One of the key differentiators of our program is the fact you experience your program on a diverse and complete college campus.

In addition, the Georgia Tech and Scheller College of Business networks have hundreds of thousands of loyal members.\nWe will be happy to schedule a class visit for you to one of our EMBA classes.

You do not have to be at an executive level to participate in the EMBA program. Our EMBA students average 10 - 15 years of work experience and are seeking a MBA that specifically focuses on the knowledge and skill sets they need to advance their careers or move into new career paths.\nThe EMBA format also offers a more enhanced level of service than most MBA programs. As a student, you gain access to a program team that handles administrative tasks and provides support during your onboarding process and throughout your 17 months as a student.\nEMBA students move through the program as a cohort, beginning the 17-month program with a weeklong residency at Georgia Tech. Students then attend classes approximately two to three weekends a month on select Friday evenings (5:30 - 9:30 p.m.) and Saturdays (8:30 a.m. - 5:30 p.m.) for the duration of the program. There are no Sunday classes. There is an additional on-campus weeklong residency in December of the first semester and a mandatory two-week international residency.\nWhat is the difference between Executive, Evening, and Full-time MBA programs?\nExecutive, Evening, and Full-time MBA designations refer to the format of the classes/program, not to the MBA degree itself. It is important to note that students who enroll in the Executive MBA program earn MBA degrees, not “Executive MBA” degrees. Upon completion of the Executive MBA program, students are awarded either an “MBA - Global Business” degree or an “MBA - Management of Technology” degree, depending on which degree specialty they select.\nWhat are the differences between the Global Business and Management of Technology specializations?\nBoth programs share a core MBA curriculum that all EMBA students, regardless of program specialty, must complete.\nGlobal Business (Leadership)\nThe Global Business (Leadership) specialization teaches you to think strategically and contribute to companies that work across borders and around the world. After the EMBA core, Global Business (Leadership) transitions to a specialized curriculum focusing on the dynamics of global competition and strategies for building a global competitive advantage. \nThe Global Strategy Project is the program's capstone experience – where you and your capstone team will work with a company to address an actual issue on a global scale. You’ll identify opportunities and make recommendations on how to implement strategies internationally, from product and pricing to procurement, logistics, and management. Learn more about the Global Business (Leadership) specialization.\nManagement of Technology (Innovation, Entrepreneurship, and Intrapreneurship)\nThe Management of Technology (Innovation, Entrepreneurship, and Intrapreneurship) specialization teaches you to forecast and embrace emerging technologies, all while managing innovation and organizational change. \nThe Management of Technology Project is the program's capstone project. As a member of a select team, you’ll choose an emerging technology and complete a full business plan, demonstrating your understanding of how to take a technology-driven product or service to market. This powerful integrative experience concludes with a juried business plan competition. Learn more about the Management of Technology (Innovation, Entrepreneurship, and Intrapreneurship) specialization.\nWhere are Executive MBA classes held?\nClasses are held in the state-of-the-art Huang Executive Education Center in the Scheller College of Business, located at the corner of West Peachtree Street and Fifth Street in Technology Square, Midtown Atlanta.\nWhat is the profile of a typical student?\nQualified candidates have several years of professional work experience (a minimum of five years is required) with a history of professional advancement and leadership. Students' personal and professional backgrounds vary, bringing diversity to the classroom experience.\nWhat career advancement outcomes can I expect from the Executive MBA program?\nOur Executive MBA students report an average 20% salary increase from program start to graduation. \nDo you have to live or work in Atlanta to participate in either EMBA program?\nNo. Though many students reside in Georgia, some students commute from other states. Travel expenses and accommodations for the domestic residencies and classes are not included in the cost of the program, but we will gladly provide you with a list of local lodging options.\nHow big is the class?\nEach degree program has approximately 70 - 80 students per cohort. \nWhat happens during the international residency?\nStudents visit businesses and educational institutions in established and emerging economies during the international residency.  You’ll examine the cultural, legal, and economic aspects of each location you visit, gaining deeper, firsthand knowledge of international business practices and cultures. Ultimately, you’ll gain an understanding of the country’s economy and how to effectively conduct business there.\nGlobal Business (Leadership) students also have the opportunity to participate in an optional second international residency. \nWhat will my diploma say?\nDepending on which of our two degrees you pursue, you will receive one of the following:\n\nMaster of Business Administration – Global Business\nMaster of Business Administration – Management of Technology\n\nHow many hours do students spend on work outside of class?\nOn average, students spend between 10 and 20 hours per week on assignments outside of class. This number will vary based on how familiar you are with the courses taught in a given semester.\nIs the program offered online?\nAt this time, we do not offer this program online.\nWhen does the program begin?\nEach cohort begins in August and graduates the following December. \nWill I have access to Georgia Tech resources?\nYes, you will have access to all student resources. One of the key differentiators of our program is the fact you experience your program on a diverse and complete college campus. Whether it is the library resources, the recreation center, or cheering for Division I-A sports teams, you are a full member of the Georgia Tech campus community.\nHow big is the alumni network?\nThe EMBA alumni network is more than 2,000 strong. In addition, the Georgia Tech and Scheller College of Business networks have hundreds of thousands of loyal members. \nCan I attend a class session to experience the program firsthand?\nWe will be happy to schedule a class visit for you to one of our EMBA classes. We request that you first attend one of our information sessions or submit your current resume for review to us at emba@gatech.edu. Upon completion of either of these requests, we will contact you to arrange a class visit that meets your schedule.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdmissions\n\n\n\nWhat are the admission requirements?\n\nWorking professional with a minimum of five years of full-time career experience\nFour-year bachelor's degree from an accredited institution\nOnline application\n\nAcademic transcripts from all previous institutions\nCurrent resume\nRequired essays (2): \n\nWhy an MBA and why the Georgia Tech Scheller College of Business?

Any applicant who can demonstrate strong quantitative skills through their academic and professional work experience is welcome to apply without a test score.

This is an excellent way of positioning yourself for future opportunities within your company if your goal is advancement within your organization. \nAre scholarships available? \nYes.

If you are unable to find the answer to a specific question or wish to speak with someone directly regarding other questions, feel free to contact us online or call 404.385.2254. To read more about MBA programs check out our Why an MBA resources.\nCommonly Asked Questions\nProgram Information\n\n\n\nWhat is the Georgia Tech Executive MBA format?\nThe Executive MBA (EMBA) format is designed for working professionals with a minimum of five years of progressive career experience. You do not have to be at an executive level to participate in the EMBA program. Our EMBA students average 10 - 15 years of work experience and are seeking a MBA that specifically focuses on the knowledge and skill sets they need to advance their careers or move into new career paths.\nThe EMBA format also offers a more enhanced level of service than most MBA programs. As a student, you gain access to a program team that handles administrative tasks and provides support during your onboarding process and throughout your 17 months as a student.\nEMBA students move through the program as a cohort, beginning the 17-month program with a weeklong residency at Georgia Tech. Students then attend classes approximately two to three weekends a month on select Friday evenings (5:30 - 9:30 p.m.) and Saturdays (8:30 a.m. - 5:30 p.m.) for the duration of the program. There are no Sunday classes. There is an additional on-campus weeklong residency in December of the first semester and a mandatory two-week international residency.\nWhat is the difference between Executive, Evening, and Full-time MBA programs?\nExecutive, Evening, and Full-time MBA designations refer to the format of the classes/program, not to the MBA degree itself. It is important to note that students who enroll in the Executive MBA program earn MBA degrees, not “Executive MBA” degrees. Upon completion of the Executive MBA program, students are awarded either an “MBA - Global Business” degree or an “MBA - Management of Technology” degree, depending on which degree specialty they select.\nWhat are the differences between the Global Business and Management of Technology specializations?\nBoth programs share a core MBA curriculum that all EMBA students, regardless of program specialty, must complete.\nGlobal Business (Leadership)\nThe Global Business (Leadership) specialization teaches you to think strategically and contribute to companies that work across borders and around the world. After the EMBA core, Global Business (Leadership) transitions to a specialized curriculum focusing on the dynamics of global competition and strategies for building a global competitive advantage. \nThe Global Strategy Project is the program's capstone experience – where you and your capstone team will work with a company to address an actual issue on a global scale. You’ll identify opportunities and make recommendations on how to implement strategies internationally, from product and pricing to procurement, logistics, and management. Learn more about the Global Business (Leadership) specialization.\nManagement of Technology (Innovation, Entrepreneurship, and Intrapreneurship)\nThe Management of Technology (Innovation, Entrepreneurship, and Intrapreneurship) specialization teaches you to forecast and embrace emerging technologies, all while managing innovation and organizational change. \nThe Management of Technology Project is the program's capstone project. As a member of a select team, you’ll choose an emerging technology and complete a full business plan, demonstrating your understanding of how to take a technology-driven product or service to market. This powerful integrative experience concludes with a juried business plan competition. Learn more about the Management of Technology (Innovation, Entrepreneurship, and Intrapreneurship) specialization.\nWhere are Executive MBA classes held?\nClasses are held in the state-of-the-art Huang Executive Education Center in the Scheller College of Business, located at the corner of West Peachtree Street and Fifth Street in Technology Square, Midtown Atlanta.\nWhat is the profile of a typical student?\nQualified candidates have several years of professional work experience (a minimum of five years is required) with a history of professional advancement and leadership. Students' personal and professional backgrounds vary, bringing diversity to the classroom experience.\nWhat career advancement outcomes can I expect from the Executive MBA program?\nOur Executive MBA students report an average 20% salary increase from program start to graduation. \nDo you have to live or work in Atlanta to participate in either EMBA program?\nNo. Though many students reside in Georgia, some students commute from other states. Travel expenses and accommodations for the domestic residencies and classes are not included in the cost of the program, but we will gladly provide you with a list of local lodging options.\nHow big is the class?\nEach degree program has approximately 70 - 80 students per cohort. \nWhat happens during the international residency?\nStudents visit businesses and educational institutions in established and emerging economies during the international residency.  You’ll examine the cultural, legal, and economic aspects of each location you visit, gaining deeper, firsthand knowledge of international business practices and cultures.

The average Executive MBA student has about 10 to 15 years of full-time, professional work experience. Students bring a wealth of knowledge from a vast array of industries and functional areas into the classroom, creating an unparalleled environment for learning and networking.\nThe program enrolls once a year with classes beginning in the fall. The program uses a rolling admissions process, meaning you can apply at any point before application deadlines and receive an admissions decision shortly thereafter. This allows you to lay out a self-paced plan to prepare and apply for the program when the time is right. The earlier you apply, the quicker you gain access to the benefits of the Executive MBA program prior to the first day of class.\nDean's Fellowships Consideration\nA select number of merit-based dean's fellowships are available to Executive MBA students that can fund a portion of program tuition. These fellowships are for applicants with outstanding previous academic performance, professional experience, and leadership potential.\nTo be considered for a fellowship, applicants must apply for admission by Round 3. A fellowship application will be sent to admitted candidates after acceptance.\nDecision Release\nAdmissions decisions are released after the admissions interview is completed.\nEnrollment Deposit\nThe $1,500 enrollment deposit is due within a designated time period after the admissions decision is released.\nInternational Credentials: Georgia Tech requires that international applicants hold the equivalent of a U.S. four-year baccalaureate degree earned from an institution authorized to award degrees by the appropriate government agency such as a Ministry of Education or the University Grants commission.\nIf you completed your education outside of the United States, we recommend using one of the three Georgia Tech-approved credential evaluation services: IEE, Educational Perspectives, or SpanTran Pathways.  If you do not choose to use one of our approved credential evaluation services, then your credentials will be evaluated in-house by the Office of Graduate Studies.\nThe Executive MBA program has a test-optional admissions policy. Any applicant who can demonstrate strong quantitative skills through their academic and professional work experience is welcome to apply without a GMAT, GMAT Focus, GRE, or EA test score. Prospective students do not have to meet certain criteria in order to pursue this option.\nIf you have any questions about the Executive MBA admissions process, we are here to help! Contact our office at emba@gatech.edu or 404.385.2254.\nThank you for requesting more information about our programs.

More than half of the students come from non-engineering backgrounds, and more than 60% do not have business degrees.\nView the Evening MBA class profile for more information.\nIs this the same program as the two-year, Full-time MBA program?\nEvening MBA students earn the same degree and enjoy the same benefits as our Full-time MBA students, including the same academically challenging curriculum, outstanding faculty, access to MBA Career Services, and social and networking opportunities.\nMajor differences are:\n\nEvening MBA students have the flexibility to complete the degree at their own pace. The Evening MBA program is not a lock-step/cohort-based program; you're not taking all your courses in a pre-set sequence with a specific group of classmates. You choose the number of courses to fit your schedule, while you continue to work and live in Atlanta.\nClasses are available during the summer.\nOn-campus recruiting is for permanent job searches and not summer internships. Evening MBA students are able to participate in on-campus recruiting for permanent positions. Since Evening MBA students are typically working professionals, we do not offer access to on-campus recruiting for summer internships. However, if you choose to pursue an internship, a career advisor is available to help with your self-guided search.\nEnrollment is in the spring and fall. The Evening MBA program enrolls twice per year and begins in the spring (January) and fall (August).\n\nWhat will my transcript and diploma say?\nThe Evening MBA diploma and transcript display \"Master of Business Administration.\" Evening MBA students receive the same degree as our Full-time MBA students.\nDo I have to take courses in a predetermined sequence or can I schedule my classes on a flexible basis?\nYou may take as few or as many courses each semester as your schedule permits; however, students are encouraged to take at least two classes, or six credit hours, per semester to complete the degree in around three years.\nHow long will it take me to complete the program and earn my MBA?\nThis is up to you and depends on how many courses you choose to take each semester. Most students complete their degree in two to three years. You will have a maximum of six years to complete the Evening MBA program.\nWhen and where are classes offered?\nClasses are offered Monday through Thursday evenings, with online, weekend, and day classes available to better accommodate your schedule and provide even greater flexibility. Each Evening MBA class meets one night per week from 6:30 to 9:15 p.m. It is possible for you to make your program a hybrid experience and complete up to half of your coursework in an online format.\nAll in-person classes are located in the Scheller College of Business building of the Georgia Tech campus in Midtown Atlanta.\nAre Evening MBA students allowed to take classes during the day?\nAll of the Evening MBA core courses must be taken in the evening. However, to give all MBA students the full range of elective offerings, Evening MBA students may take electives during the day if their work schedule permits.\nCan Evening MBA students automatically \"switch\" into the two-year Full-time MBA program?\nYou can't automatically \"switch\" from the Evening MBA to the Full-time MBA. However, students who have completed 12 or fewer credit hours can apply for admission. Consideration is limited to students with 12 or fewer credit hours because the Full-time MBA is a lock-step/cohort-based program. Full-time MBAs take all core courses together and in a pre-set sequence.The Full-time MBA program begins only in the fall. Candidates will be considered with the current pool of applicants and must submit materials by the Full-time MBA application deadlines.\nIs the Georgia Tech Evening MBA ranked?\nYes, the Georgia Tech Evening MBA program is ranked a top evening MBA program by U.S. News & World Report.\nThe rankings are a good place to start your research on business schools. However, your final decision about where to enroll should have more to do with personal and professional \"fit\" than rankings.\nWhat are the benefits of the Georgia Tech Evening MBA program?\nThe benefits of Georgia Tech's Evening MBA program are many, but some of the highlights include:\n\nLearning from the same comprehensive Full-time MBA curriculum without interrupting your career.\nFlexibility to choose the number of courses to fit your schedule and complete your degree at your own pace.\nEarning a degree recognized worldwide, and a top-ranked MBA from an internationally respected university.\nAccess to an experienced career services team to help you develop and implement a strategy to promote or transition your career.\nIn-person engagements offer you numerous educational, professional, and social opportunities.\n\nHow do I learn more?\nRequest Information\nTo request a brochure, complete the request more information form.\nAttend an Event\nMBA information sessions are held year-round. Attending is a great way to meet students, admissions staff, and faculty members while learning about the program.\nConnect With an Evening MBA Ambassador\nYou may contact an Evening MBA Ambassador about a particular area of study or other program questions.

More than half of the students come from non-engineering backgrounds, and more than 60% do not have business degrees.\nView the Evening MBA class profile for more information.\nIs this the same program as the two-year, Full-time MBA program?\nEvening MBA students earn the same degree and enjoy the same benefits as our Full-time MBA students, including the same academically challenging curriculum, outstanding faculty, access to MBA Career Services, and social and networking opportunities.\nMajor differences are:\n\nEvening MBA students have the flexibility to complete the degree at their own pace. The Evening MBA program is not a lock-step/cohort-based program; you're not taking all your courses in a pre-set sequence with a specific group of classmates. You choose the number of courses to fit your schedule, while you continue to work and live in Atlanta.\nClasses are available during the summer.\nOn-campus recruiting is for permanent job searches and not summer internships. Evening MBA students are able to participate in on-campus recruiting for permanent positions. Since Evening MBA students are typically working professionals, we do not offer access to on-campus recruiting for summer internships. However, if you choose to pursue an internship, a career advisor is available to help with your self-guided search.\nEnrollment is in the spring and fall. The Evening MBA program enrolls twice per year and begins in the spring (January) and fall (August).\n\nWhat will my transcript and diploma say?\nThe Evening MBA diploma and transcript display \"Master of Business Administration.\" Evening MBA students receive the same degree as our Full-time MBA students.\nDo I have to take courses in a predetermined sequence or can I schedule my classes on a flexible basis?\nYou may take as few or as many courses each semester as your schedule permits; however, students are encouraged to take at least two classes, or six credit hours, per semester to complete the degree in around three years.\nHow long will it take me to complete the program and earn my MBA?\nThis is up to you and depends on how many courses you choose to take each semester. Most students complete their degree in two to three years. You will have a maximum of six years to complete the Evening MBA program.\nWhen and where are classes offered?\nClasses are offered Monday through Thursday evenings, with online, weekend, and day classes available to better accommodate your schedule and provide even greater flexibility. Each Evening MBA class meets one night per week from 6:30 to 9:15 p.m. It is possible for you to make your program a hybrid experience and complete up to half of your coursework in an online format.\nAll in-person classes are located in the Scheller College of Business building of the Georgia Tech campus in Midtown Atlanta.\nAre Evening MBA students allowed to take classes during the day?\nAll of the Evening MBA core courses must be taken in the evening. However, to give all MBA students the full range of elective offerings, Evening MBA students may take electives during the day if their work schedule permits.\nCan Evening MBA students automatically \"switch\" into the two-year Full-time MBA program?\nYou can't automatically \"switch\" from the Evening MBA to the Full-time MBA. However, students who have completed 12 or fewer credit hours can apply for admission. Consideration is limited to students with 12 or fewer credit hours because the Full-time MBA is a lock-step/cohort-based program. Full-time MBAs take all core courses together and in a pre-set sequence.The Full-time MBA program begins only in the fall. Candidates will be considered with the current pool of applicants and must submit materials by the Full-time MBA application deadlines.\nIs the Georgia Tech Evening MBA ranked?\nYes, the Georgia Tech Evening MBA program is ranked a top evening MBA program by U.S. News & World Report.\nThe rankings are a good place to start your research on business schools. However, your final decision about where to enroll should have more to do with personal and professional \"fit\" than rankings.\nWhat are the benefits of the Georgia Tech Evening MBA program?\nThe benefits of Georgia Tech's Evening MBA program are many, but some of the highlights include:\n\nLearning from the same comprehensive Full-time MBA curriculum without interrupting your career.\nFlexibility to choose the number of courses to fit your schedule and complete your degree at your own pace.\nEarning a degree recognized worldwide, and a top-ranked MBA from an internationally respected university.\nAccess to an experienced career services team to help you develop and implement a strategy to promote or transition your career.\nIn-person engagements offer you numerous educational, professional, and social opportunities.\n\nHow do I learn more?\nRequest Information\nTo request a brochure, complete the request more information form.\nAttend an Event\nMBA information sessions are held year-round.

More than half of the students come from non-engineering backgrounds, and more than 60% do not have business degrees.\nView the Evening MBA class profile for more information.\nIs this the same program as the two-year, Full-time MBA program?\nEvening MBA students earn the same degree and enjoy the same benefits as our Full-time MBA students, including the same academically challenging curriculum, outstanding faculty, access to MBA Career Services, and social and networking opportunities.\nMajor differences are:\n\nEvening MBA students have the flexibility to complete the degree at their own pace. The Evening MBA program is not a lock-step/cohort-based program; you're not taking all your courses in a pre-set sequence with a specific group of classmates. You choose the number of courses to fit your schedule, while you continue to work and live in Atlanta.\nClasses are available during the summer.\nOn-campus recruiting is for permanent job searches and not summer internships. Evening MBA students are able to participate in on-campus recruiting for permanent positions. Since Evening MBA students are typically working professionals, we do not offer access to on-campus recruiting for summer internships. However, if you choose to pursue an internship, a career advisor is available to help with your self-guided search.\nEnrollment is in the spring and fall. The Evening MBA program enrolls twice per year and begins in the spring (January) and fall (August).\n\nWhat will my transcript and diploma say?\nThe Evening MBA diploma and transcript display \"Master of Business Administration.\" Evening MBA students receive the same degree as our Full-time MBA students.\nDo I have to take courses in a predetermined sequence or can I schedule my classes on a flexible basis?\nYou may take as few or as many courses each semester as your schedule permits; however, students are encouraged to take at least two classes, or six credit hours, per semester to complete the degree in around three years.\nHow long will it take me to complete the program and earn my MBA?\nThis is up to you and depends on how many courses you choose to take each semester. Most students complete their degree in two to three years. You will have a maximum of six years to complete the Evening MBA program.\nWhen and where are classes offered?\nClasses are offered Monday through Thursday evenings, with online, weekend, and day classes available to better accommodate your schedule and provide even greater flexibility. Each Evening MBA class meets one night per week from 6:30 to 9:15 p.m. It is possible for you to make your program a hybrid experience and complete up to half of your coursework in an online format.\nAll in-person classes are located in the Scheller College of Business building of the Georgia Tech campus in Midtown Atlanta.\nAre Evening MBA students allowed to take classes during the day?\nAll of the Evening MBA core courses must be taken in the evening. However, to give all MBA students the full range of elective offerings, Evening MBA students may take electives during the day if their work schedule permits.\nCan Evening MBA students automatically \"switch\" into the two-year Full-time MBA program?\nYou can't automatically \"switch\" from the Evening MBA to the Full-time MBA. However, students who have completed 12 or fewer credit hours can apply for admission. Consideration is limited to students with 12 or fewer credit hours because the Full-time MBA is a lock-step/cohort-based program. Full-time MBAs take all core courses together and in a pre-set sequence.The Full-time MBA program begins only in the fall. Candidates will be considered with the current pool of applicants and must submit materials by the Full-time MBA application deadlines.\nIs the Georgia Tech Evening MBA ranked?\nYes, the Georgia Tech Evening MBA program is ranked a top evening MBA program by U.S. News & World Report.\nThe rankings are a good place to start your research on business schools. However, your final decision about where to enroll should have more to do with personal and professional \"fit\" than rankings.\nWhat are the benefits of the Georgia Tech Evening MBA program?\nThe benefits of Georgia Tech's Evening MBA program are many, but some of the highlights include:\n\nLearning from the same comprehensive Full-time MBA curriculum without interrupting your career.\nFlexibility to choose the number of courses to fit your schedule and complete your degree at your own pace.\nEarning a degree recognized worldwide, and a top-ranked MBA from an internationally respected university.\nAccess to an experienced career services team to help you develop and implement a strategy to promote or transition your career.\nIn-person engagements offer you numerous educational, professional, and social opportunities.\n\nHow do I learn more?\nRequest Information\nTo request a brochure, complete the request more information form.\nAttend an Event\nMBA information sessions are held year-round. Attending is a great way to meet students, admissions staff, and faculty members while learning about the program.\nConnect With an Evening MBA Ambassador\nYou may contact an Evening MBA Ambassador about a particular area of study or other program questions. MBA ambassadors are students currently enrolled in the Georgia Tech Evening MBA program.\nWhere is the Georgia Tech Scheller College of Business MBA Admissions Office located?\nThe MBA Admissions Office is located on the third floor, in suite 302, of the Georgia Tech Scheller College of Business.

Considered in the admission decision are undergraduate (and graduate, if applicable) academic performance, GMAT, GMAT Focus, or GRE scores, TOEFL or IELTS scores for many international applicants, work experience, essays, interview, letters of recommendation, leadership potential, career fit, and other documentation supporting the application. We look at each applicant, and application, in a holistic manner when making admission decisions.\nAt Scheller, there is no point system or \"secret formula.\" We are truly interested in building a program of diverse, forward thinking individuals. However, the College doesn't compromise on quality and seeks students who demonstrate strong and appropiate work experience, leadership, maturity, community activity, intellectual capacity, and competitive academic credentials (GMAT, GMAT Focus, or GRE score and GPA). Strengths in one area may compensate for weaknesses in another area.\nTreat your admissions interview like an employment interview. Dress professionally and come prepared; bring your resume and do your research in advance.\nThe timing for your admission decision will depend on which round you submitted your complete application.

The Georgia Tech MBA program is no exception. We look for students who can demonstrate quantitative aptitude through academic performance, test scores, and/or professional responsibilities. Students may customize electives to meet their unique interests and goals, which may or may not be quantitatively focused.\nStudents from a wide range of academic and professional backgrounds excel in our program and go on to very successful careers in a variety of functional areas and industries.\nCore courses expose students to all functional areas of business, preparing them for elective coursework. Students choose from a variety of electives across multiple academic areas or focus their learning by pursuing concentrations. By no means are you expected to have a technical background, degree, or work experience in order to be considered for admission.\nAbsolutely not! While the core courses move at a fast pace, they do not assume knowledge from previous business coursework. Our curriculum is designed for you to build a solid foundation in all the functional areas of business.\nCore courses give you an opportunity to explore new concepts, identify new strengths and skills, and prepare you to get the most out of our electives, while providing knowledge you'll reference throughout your career. Additionally, at Scheller College, we look for diversity in our class profile - both in experience and background. In this way you will be able to lean on classmates with different backgrounds to help you succeed.\nNo, all core courses are required and cannot be waived. For students who have taken undergraduate business courses, MBA core courses offer a refresher to business concepts that are necessary for success in elective courses.\nAlso, while you may have completed business courses at the undergraduate level, the graduate versions of those courses are more rigorous and application-based. MBA courses are further enhanced by classmates who will share professional experiences, making class discussions more applicable and dynamic.\nOur compressed core course schedule is designed for you to build the most essential business skills fast. Even without waiving core courses, you'll take electives during the first year to be prepared for your internships.\nWe have a wide variety of students with different academic and professional backgrounds. For more information, visit our class profile page.\nNo, it is quite common for MBA students to go through a \"discovery period\" during their first semester. To help you define both your internship experience and your post-MBA plans, you will work with career and academic advisors, attend company presentations, talk with faculty and second-year students, and take a variety of elective coursework. Here at Scheller College we recognize that \"pivoting\" careers is a high priority for many students and offer several resources to find your true passion.\nOne official concentration (four courses) is required of all MBA students.\nNo. The Full-time MBA program enrolls once per year with classes starting every August. Applications are only accepted for the fall semester. The Evening MBA program accepts applications for both the spring and fall semesters.\nThe Full-time MBA program is a two-year, full-time program only. The Evening MBA program follows a part-time flexible format. Classes are held in the evening, allowing working professionals to complete their studies at their own pace. However, all classes are held on campus; there is no distance-learning option for the Full-time and Evening MBA programs. If not already living local in the Atlanta area, students would need to plan to be in Atlanta for all classes, regardless of program choice.\n54 credit hours are required to earn an MBA at Georgia Tech. Students will take 12 core courses (21 credit hours) and choose 11 electives (33 credit hours).\nYes, select courses are available to non-MBA students at Georgia Tech. Students enrolled in another graduate program at Georgia Tech may register for a maximum of nine hours of MBA elective courses.\nIf you're interested in pursuing an MBA in addition to your other graduate degree, learn more about dual degree.\nYes, if the MBA courses did not count as credit hours for another graduate degree, and the courses were completed within six years prior to earning the MBA degree. The same course is not able to satisfy requirements for multiple degrees unless you are a dual degree student. Dual degree students must be admitted to the MBA program before completing their other graduate degree program in order for any courses to count toward both degrees.\nUp to nine credit hours of eligible coursework completed before you enrolled in the MBA program can be applied toward earning your MBA degree.\nOnce you have narrowed your list of potential MBA programs, you should schedule a campus visit, if possible. Each program has its own distinct personality and while it's important to select programs that will help you in achieving your career goals, the emotional part of your decision is also significant.

An MBA degree is an excellent investment to help you make a career transition.

The process begins in the summer before school starts by helping students develop individual plans that will lead to challenging and rewarding opportunities while enrolled in the program, upon graduation, and throughout their careers.\nOur primary focus is for all students to have a great job by graduation. The following is a typical career development schedule for students enrolled in the Full-time MBA program:\nSummer (process begins before classes start)\nFall Semester\nSpring Semester\nWe believe it's a combination of the experience of our career advisors, the size of our program, and career services' involvement in the admission process.\nWe have an experienced staff comprised of advisors with college recruiting expertise and a wide range of corporate experience. Advisors have served in various career development, human resources, and management roles at companies including AT&T, IBM, and HP.\nThe size of our program allows for more personal attention and a very low ratio of students to career advisors compared to other schools.\nThe career services team is a part of the interview and admissions process. Our goal is to have every student graduate with the exciting career of their choice, and students are admitted with success in mind. We listen to your career aspirations and have a very open dialogue with you about your opportunity to reach that goal.\nView the latest Georgia Tech career results and placement figures on the Full-time MBA career development page.\nView current MBA tuition and fees.\nYes, more than 50% of Full-time MBA students receive funding from the Scheller College of Business including graduate assistantships (GRAs) and fellowships.

Non-United States citizens may need to submit English proficiency scores from TOEFL or IELTS exams in accordance with Georgia Tech's Graduate Studies English Proficiency Policy. Application processing may take longer due to the review of foreign academic transcripts and financial documents. We strongly encourage all international applicants to submit application materials early to expedite the admissions process.\nApplicants who are not citizens or permanent residents of the United States, or of a country where English is not the sole official language of instruction, and who have not successfully completed at least one year of study at an accredited university in the United States must submit a valid TOEFL or IELTS score.\nCountries, where English is the sole official language of instruction, include Australia, Bahamas, Barbados, Bermuda, Belize, Canada — except Québec, Cayman Islands, Ghana, Guam, Ireland, Jamaica, Kenya, Liberia, New Zealand, Nigeria, Scotland, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Singapore, Trinidad & Tobago, Uganda, United Kingdom, and Wales.\nScores are valid for two years.\nThe minimum TOEFL score is 95 on the internet-based test (iBT).\nThe minimum IELTS score is an overall score of 7 with minimum section scores for reading 6.5, listening 6.5, speaking 6.5, and writing 5.5.\nIf you are taking the IELTS please search on \"Georgia Institute of Technology\" then choose \"Graduate\" to have your scores sent to Georgia Tech.\nAll applicants, including international students, are considered for funding. The primary form of funding for non-U.S. citizens is graduate assistantships (GRA). Funding is limited and is awarded based on merit.\nInternational students are not eligible for federal or state financial aid programs. A variety of privately funded loan programs may be available — view the international student page on Georgia Tech's Office of International Education website.\nAll non-U.S. citizens must provide a certified financial statement outlining the financial resources available to them for their study in the United States. No visa documents will be issued until the Graduate Studies Office receives documentation that the applicant has sufficient resources to meet the expenses for at least the first year of graduate study at Georgia Tech.\nCertification of the availability of these funds must be included after admission and confirmation of intent to enroll. All documents must be originals. No photocopies or faxes will be accepted.\nIf a person or organization will be providing the funds on the student's behalf, an official letter of support from the sponsor is required. The letter should include the full name of the sponsor, his/her relationship to the applicant, and the amount and length of the support.\nGeorgia state legislature approves tuition amounts annually in April; I-20 processing begins each May. The I-20s will be delivered to the student via express mail. For more information on I-20 processing, visit the Office of International Education process for issuing a graduate I-20 page.\nA certified financial statement must:\nFor more information on financial document requirements visit the Office of International Education financial document requirements page.\nAll applicants to the MBA program must hold the equivalent of a U.S. bachelor's degree to be considered for admission. A three-year degree is not equivalent to a U.S. bachelor's degree. While an additional master's degree might improve the likelihood of eligibility, neither professional designations nor work experience will count toward the fourth year of study. Additional information about this policy and the approved credential evaluation services that Georgia Tech Graduate Studies will consider can be found on the website.\nThe Georgia Tech Graduate Studies Office requires the following documents from international applicants:\nFor more information, visit the Georgia Tech Graduate Studies website.\nEffective May 31, 2022, the MBA program is recognized as a Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) degree. International students graduating with an MBA degree after this date will be eligible to apply for a two-year Optional Practical Training (OPT) extension.\nGenerally, admission can be deferred for one year. If you are admitted and want to defer your admission, contact us at mba@scheller.gatech.edu or call 404.894.8722 for more information.\nAll reapplicants must submit a new application to be considered for admission.\nApplicants interested in having their applications reconsidered for the next admissions year should submit a new application. In the application optional essay, reapplicants should address steps taken to improve their new application (e.g., new test scores (GMAT, GMAT Focus, GRE, or TOEFL), additional coursework, additional work experience, etc.).\nInternational prospects should apply in Round 1 or 2.\nDue to the volume of applications, we regret we are not able to provide individual feedback to candidates who have been declined. To make a self-assessment about the decision, declined applicants are encouraged to view the admitted students' class profile and make an assessment of their own application given the following criteria: clear communication throughout the admissions process about career goals, Georgia Tech interest, personal strengths, and professional and leadership experiences; English proficiency; quantitative and analytical aptitude; noteworthy academic achievement, impressive career results, and GMAT, GMAT Focus, or GRE scores that are close to, or exceed, the median scores of the previous entering class.\nNo. Each application is reviewed on its own merits.\nThank you for requesting more information about our programs.

Considered in the admission decision are undergraduate (and graduate, if applicable) academic performance, GMAT, GMAT Focus, or GRE scores, TOEFL or IELTS scores for many international applicants, work experience, essays, interview, letters of recommendation, leadership potential, career fit, and other documentation supporting the application. We look at each applicant, and application, in a holistic manner when making admission decisions.\nWhat makes an application stand out among others?\nAt Scheller, there is no point system or \"secret formula.\" We are truly interested in building a program of diverse, forward thinking individuals. However, the College doesn't compromise on quality and seeks students who demonstrate strong and appropiate work experience, leadership, maturity, community activity, intellectual capacity, and competitive academic credentials (GMAT, GMAT Focus, or GRE score and GPA). Strengths in one area may compensate for weaknesses in another area.\nWhat do I bring to my admissions interview?\nTreat your admissions interview like an employment interview. Dress professionally and come prepared; bring your resume and do your research in advance.\nWhen and how will I receive an admissions decision?\nThe timing for your admission decision will depend on which round you submitted your complete application. You will receive a notification via email when your decision is available to view in our application system. Admission decisions cannot be given over the phone.\nWhat is the admission profile on the recent class enrolled?\nView our current class profile. \nIs work experience required to be accepted in the program?\nWe strongly recommend at least three years of professional work experience. In addition to the contributions they make to the classroom, students with professional work experience find the MBA more enriching, professionally and personally. Moreover, many of our partner companies require current students to have at least three years of work experience to be considered for a summer internship or full-time career placement. \nI have not taken any undergraduate courses in business. Will that affect my chances of admission?\nNo, this will not affect your admission and you will not be at a disadvantage in classes. About 70% of our MBA students hold non-business undergraduate degrees. The admissions committee strives to admit students from a wide range of undergraduate and professional backgrounds.\nAre there any education prerequisites to the MBA program?\nYes, a bachelor's degree. We welcome applicants with accredited four-year bachelor's degrees from all academic backgrounds.\nAm I eligible for admission to your program if I have an MBA from another institution?\nIf you have an MBA from an institution outside the U.S., you may be eligible for admission. If you have an MBA from another institution inside the U.S., you are ineligible to qualify for admission to our MBA program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplication Process\n\n\n\nWhat are the application deadlines for the Full-time MBA program?\nView application deadlines and more details about application requirements.\nHow can I apply?\nSubmit the online application.

Permanent residents are exempt from English proficiency exams and are not required to submit financial documents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurriculum\n\n\n\nIs this a heavily quantitative program?\nThe core curriculum of MBA programs tends to be quantitative in nature, which is why most MBA programs look for strong quantitative skills during the admissions process. The Georgia Tech MBA program is no exception. We look for students who can demonstrate quantitative aptitude through academic performance, test scores, and/or professional responsibilities. Students may customize electives to meet their unique interests and goals, which may or may not be quantitatively focused.\nHow do students with non-technical backgrounds perform?\nStudents from a wide range of academic and professional backgrounds excel in our program and go on to very successful careers in a variety of functional areas and industries.\nCore courses expose students to all functional areas of business, preparing them for elective coursework. Students choose from a variety of electives across multiple academic areas or focus their learning by pursuing concentrations. By no means are you expected to have a technical background, degree, or work experience in order to be considered for admission.\nWill I be at a disadvantage in my MBA classes if I haven't taken any business courses previously?\nAbsolutely not! While the core courses move at a fast pace, they do not assume knowledge from previous business coursework. Our curriculum is designed for you to build a solid foundation in all the functional areas of business.\nCore courses give you an opportunity to explore new concepts, identify new strengths and skills, and prepare you to get the most out of our electives, while providing knowledge you'll reference throughout your career. Additionally, at Scheller College, we look for diversity in our class profile - both in experience and background. In this way you will be able to lean on classmates with different backgrounds to help you succeed. \nMy undergraduate degree is in business administration and I have taken some of the core courses already. Can I waive courses in the MBA curriculum?\nNo, all core courses are required and cannot be waived. For students who have taken undergraduate business courses, MBA core courses offer a refresher to business concepts that are necessary for success in elective courses.\nAlso, while you may have completed business courses at the undergraduate level, the graduate versions of those courses are more rigorous and application-based. MBA courses are further enhanced by classmates who will share professional experiences, making class discussions more applicable and dynamic.\nOur compressed core course schedule is designed for you to build the most essential business skills fast. Even without waiving core courses, you'll take electives during the first year to be prepared for your internships.\nWhat's the typical student profile in the program?\nWe have a wide variety of students with different academic and professional backgrounds. For more information, visit our class profile page.\nDo I need to know what job I want before I start?\nNo, it is quite common for MBA students to go through a \"discovery period\" during their first semester. To help you define both your internship experience and your post-MBA plans, you will work with career and academic advisors, attend company presentations, talk with faculty and second-year students, and take a variety of elective coursework. Here at Scheller College we recognize that \"pivoting\" careers is a high priority for many students and offer several resources to find your true passion. \nDo I have to declare a concentration?\nOne official concentration (four courses) is required of all MBA students.\nCan I start the Full-time MBA program in the spring semester?\nNo. The Full-time MBA program enrolls once per year with classes starting every August. Applications are only accepted for the fall semester. The Evening MBA program accepts applications for both the spring and fall semesters.\nCan I complete the MBA program on a part-time or distance-learning basis?\nThe Full-time MBA program is a two-year, full-time program only. The Evening MBA program follows a part-time flexible format. Classes are held in the evening, allowing working professionals to complete their studies at their own pace. However, all classes are held on campus; there is no distance-learning option for the Full-time and Evening MBA programs. If not already living local in the Atlanta area, students would need to plan to be in Atlanta for all classes, regardless of program choice.\nHow many credit hours are required to earn an MBA at Georgia Tech?\n54 credit hours are required to earn an MBA at Georgia Tech. Students will take 12 core courses (21 credit hours) and choose 11 electives (33 credit hours).\nI am a student in another graduate program at Georgia Tech. Can I take MBA courses?\nYes, select courses are available to non-MBA students at Georgia Tech. Students enrolled in another graduate program at Georgia Tech may register for a maximum of nine hours of MBA elective courses.\nIf you're interested in pursuing an MBA in addition to your other graduate degree, learn more about dual degree.\nI completed Georgia Tech MBA courses while I was enrolled in another graduate program at Georgia Tech. If I enroll in the MBA program, will the courses apply toward earning my MBA?\nYes, if the MBA courses did not count as credit hours for another graduate degree, and the courses were completed within six years prior to earning the MBA degree. The same course is not able to satisfy requirements for multiple degrees unless you are a dual degree student. Dual degree students must be admitted to the MBA program before completing their other graduate degree program in order for any courses to count toward both degrees.\nUp to nine credit hours of eligible coursework completed before you enrolled in the MBA program can be applied toward earning your MBA degree.\nHow do I learn more?\nOnce you have narrowed your list of potential MBA programs, you should schedule a campus visit, if possible. Each program has its own distinct personality and while it's important to select programs that will help you in achieving your career goals, the emotional part of your decision is also significant.

By no means are you expected to have a technical background, degree, or work experience in order to be considered for admission.\nWill I be at a disadvantage in my MBA classes if I haven't taken any business courses previously?\nAbsolutely not! While the core courses move at a fast pace, they do not assume knowledge from previous business coursework. Our curriculum is designed for you to build a solid foundation in all the functional areas of business.\nCore courses give you an opportunity to explore new concepts, identify new strengths and skills, and prepare you to get the most out of our electives, while providing knowledge you'll reference throughout your career. Additionally, at Scheller College, we look for diversity in our class profile - both in experience and background. In this way you will be able to lean on classmates with different backgrounds to help you succeed. \nMy undergraduate degree is in business administration and I have taken some of the core courses already. Can I waive courses in the MBA curriculum?\nNo, all core courses are required and cannot be waived. For students who have taken undergraduate business courses, MBA core courses offer a refresher to business concepts that are necessary for success in elective courses.\nAlso, while you may have completed business courses at the undergraduate level, the graduate versions of those courses are more rigorous and application-based. MBA courses are further enhanced by classmates who will share professional experiences, making class discussions more applicable and dynamic.\nOur compressed core course schedule is designed for you to build the most essential business skills fast. Even without waiving core courses, you'll take electives during the first year to be prepared for your internships.\nWhat's the typical student profile in the program?\nWe have a wide variety of students with different academic and professional backgrounds. For more information, visit our class profile page.\nDo I need to know what job I want before I start?\nNo, it is quite common for MBA students to go through a \"discovery period\" during their first semester. To help you define both your internship experience and your post-MBA plans, you will work with career and academic advisors, attend company presentations, talk with faculty and second-year students, and take a variety of elective coursework. Here at Scheller College we recognize that \"pivoting\" careers is a high priority for many students and offer several resources to find your true passion. \nDo I have to declare a concentration?\nOne official concentration (four courses) is required of all MBA students.\nCan I start the Full-time MBA program in the spring semester?\nNo. The Full-time MBA program enrolls once per year with classes starting every August. Applications are only accepted for the fall semester. The Evening MBA program accepts applications for both the spring and fall semesters.\nCan I complete the MBA program on a part-time or distance-learning basis?\nThe Full-time MBA program is a two-year, full-time program only. The Evening MBA program follows a part-time flexible format. Classes are held in the evening, allowing working professionals to complete their studies at their own pace. However, all classes are held on campus; there is no distance-learning option for the Full-time and Evening MBA programs. If not already living local in the Atlanta area, students would need to plan to be in Atlanta for all classes, regardless of program choice.\nHow many credit hours are required to earn an MBA at Georgia Tech?\n54 credit hours are required to earn an MBA at Georgia Tech. Students will take 12 core courses (21 credit hours) and choose 11 electives (33 credit hours).\nI am a student in another graduate program at Georgia Tech. Can I take MBA courses?\nYes, select courses are available to non-MBA students at Georgia Tech. Students enrolled in another graduate program at Georgia Tech may register for a maximum of nine hours of MBA elective courses.\nIf you're interested in pursuing an MBA in addition to your other graduate degree, learn more about dual degree.\nI completed Georgia Tech MBA courses while I was enrolled in another graduate program at Georgia Tech. If I enroll in the MBA program, will the courses apply toward earning my MBA?\nYes, if the MBA courses did not count as credit hours for another graduate degree, and the courses were completed within six years prior to earning the MBA degree. The same course is not able to satisfy requirements for multiple degrees unless you are a dual degree student. Dual degree students must be admitted to the MBA program before completing their other graduate degree program in order for any courses to count toward both degrees.\nUp to nine credit hours of eligible coursework completed before you enrolled in the MBA program can be applied toward earning your MBA degree.\nHow do I learn more?\nOnce you have narrowed your list of potential MBA programs, you should schedule a campus visit, if possible. Each program has its own distinct personality and while it's important to select programs that will help you in achieving your career goals, the emotional part of your decision is also significant.

We look at each applicant, and application, in a holistic manner when making admission decisions.\nWhat makes an application stand out among others?\nAt Scheller, there is no point system or \"secret formula.\" We are truly interested in building a program of diverse, forward thinking individuals. However, the College doesn't compromise on quality and seeks students who demonstrate strong and appropiate work experience, leadership, maturity, community activity, intellectual capacity, and competitive academic credentials (GMAT, GMAT Focus, or GRE score and GPA). Strengths in one area may compensate for weaknesses in another area.\nWhat do I bring to my admissions interview?\nTreat your admissions interview like an employment interview. Dress professionally and come prepared; bring your resume and do your research in advance.\nWhen and how will I receive an admissions decision?\nThe timing for your admission decision will depend on which round you submitted your complete application.

In addition to the contributions they make to the classroom, students with professional work experience find the MBA more enriching, professionally and personally. Moreover, many of our partner companies require current students to have at least three years of work experience to be considered for a summer internship or full-time career placement. \nI have not taken any undergraduate courses in business. Will that affect my chances of admission?\nNo, this will not affect your admission and you will not be at a disadvantage in classes.

After submitting your application, if you're selected for an interview, an admissions representative will contact you to schedule your interview during one of our on-campus Interview Days. We strongly encourage you to interview on campus as our Interview Days provide a comprehensive look into what it looks like to become a member of our community. In addition to your interview, you will have the opportunity to connect with current students and tour Scheller College of Business. However, if you are unable to visit in person, we can schedule a virtual interview. Interviews are led by Admissions and Career Services staff members.\nIf I am a permanent resident, is the application process different?\nIf you're a permanent resident of the United States, you must include a copy of your Permanent Resident Card (Green Card), both front and back, with your application. The remaining application process is the same as for U.S. citizens. Permanent residents are exempt from English proficiency exams and are not required to submit financial documents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurriculum\n\n\n\nIs this a heavily quantitative program?\nThe core curriculum of MBA programs tends to be quantitative in nature, which is why most MBA programs look for strong quantitative skills during the admissions process. The Georgia Tech MBA program is no exception. We look for students who can demonstrate quantitative aptitude through academic performance, test scores, and/or professional responsibilities. Students may customize electives to meet their unique interests and goals, which may or may not be quantitatively focused.\nHow do students with non-technical backgrounds perform?\nStudents from a wide range of academic and professional backgrounds excel in our program and go on to very successful careers in a variety of functional areas and industries.\nCore courses expose students to all functional areas of business, preparing them for elective coursework. Students choose from a variety of electives across multiple academic areas or focus their learning by pursuing concentrations. By no means are you expected to have a technical background, degree, or work experience in order to be considered for admission.\nWill I be at a disadvantage in my MBA classes if I haven't taken any business courses previously?\nAbsolutely not! While the core courses move at a fast pace, they do not assume knowledge from previous business coursework. Our curriculum is designed for you to build a solid foundation in all the functional areas of business.\nCore courses give you an opportunity to explore new concepts, identify new strengths and skills, and prepare you to get the most out of our electives, while providing knowledge you'll reference throughout your career. Additionally, at Scheller College, we look for diversity in our class profile - both in experience and background. In this way you will be able to lean on classmates with different backgrounds to help you succeed. \nMy undergraduate degree is in business administration and I have taken some of the core courses already. Can I waive courses in the MBA curriculum?\nNo, all core courses are required and cannot be waived. For students who have taken undergraduate business courses, MBA core courses offer a refresher to business concepts that are necessary for success in elective courses.\nAlso, while you may have completed business courses at the undergraduate level, the graduate versions of those courses are more rigorous and application-based. MBA courses are further enhanced by classmates who will share professional experiences, making class discussions more applicable and dynamic.\nOur compressed core course schedule is designed for you to build the most essential business skills fast. Even without waiving core courses, you'll take electives during the first year to be prepared for your internships.\nWhat's the typical student profile in the program?\nWe have a wide variety of students with different academic and professional backgrounds. For more information, visit our class profile page.\nDo I need to know what job I want before I start?\nNo, it is quite common for MBA students to go through a \"discovery period\" during their first semester. To help you define both your internship experience and your post-MBA plans, you will work with career and academic advisors, attend company presentations, talk with faculty and second-year students, and take a variety of elective coursework. Here at Scheller College we recognize that \"pivoting\" careers is a high priority for many students and offer several resources to find your true passion. \nDo I have to declare a concentration?\nOne official concentration (four courses) is required of all MBA students.\nCan I start the Full-time MBA program in the spring semester?\nNo. The Full-time MBA program enrolls once per year with classes starting every August. Applications are only accepted for the fall semester. The Evening MBA program accepts applications for both the spring and fall semesters.\nCan I complete the MBA program on a part-time or distance-learning basis?\nThe Full-time MBA program is a two-year, full-time program only. The Evening MBA program follows a part-time flexible format. Classes are held in the evening, allowing working professionals to complete their studies at their own pace. However, all classes are held on campus; there is no distance-learning option for the Full-time and Evening MBA programs. If not already living local in the Atlanta area, students would need to plan to be in Atlanta for all classes, regardless of program choice.\nHow many credit hours are required to earn an MBA at Georgia Tech?\n54 credit hours are required to earn an MBA at Georgia Tech. Students will take 12 core courses (21 credit hours) and choose 11 electives (33 credit hours).\nI am a student in another graduate program at Georgia Tech. Can I take MBA courses?\nYes, select courses are available to non-MBA students at Georgia Tech. Students enrolled in another graduate program at Georgia Tech may register for a maximum of nine hours of MBA elective courses.\nIf you're interested in pursuing an MBA in addition to your other graduate degree, learn more about dual degree.\nI completed Georgia Tech MBA courses while I was enrolled in another graduate program at Georgia Tech. If I enroll in the MBA program, will the courses apply toward earning my MBA?\nYes, if the MBA courses did not count as credit hours for another graduate degree, and the courses were completed within six years prior to earning the MBA degree. The same course is not able to satisfy requirements for multiple degrees unless you are a dual degree student. Dual degree students must be admitted to the MBA program before completing their other graduate degree program in order for any courses to count toward both degrees.\nUp to nine credit hours of eligible coursework completed before you enrolled in the MBA program can be applied toward earning your MBA degree.\nHow do I learn more?\nOnce you have narrowed your list of potential MBA programs, you should schedule a campus visit, if possible. Each program has its own distinct personality and while it's important to select programs that will help you in achieving your career goals, the emotional part of your decision is also significant. Visit a class, talk with current students, faculty, and career services staff, and tour Scheller College.

An MBA degree is an excellent investment to help you make a career transition. Whether you are changing roles within a company, transitioning to a new career within the same industry, or making a professional pivot, our career development process and a summer internship can facilitate your transition. The majority of our students are looking to make career transitions and find our program helps bridge previous gaps in experience or education. \nWhat support do you offer for job searches and career development?\nThe Jones Career Center is a state-of-the-art facility that offers exemplary career resources and one-on-one career advisement for MBA students.

Advisors have served in various career development, human resources, and management roles at companies including AT&T, IBM, and HP.\nThe size of our program allows for more personal attention and a very low ratio of students to career advisors compared to other schools.\nThe career services team is a part of the interview and admissions process.

The ratio compares the median salary of full-time MBA program graduates to the total out-of-state tuition and fees for the two-year-program, allowing prospective students to gauge a program's cost-effectiveness. The tool can serve as a valuable indicator in assessing top-ranked programs and their potential return on investment (ROI).\n[HEADING] Ready to Get Started?\n[HEADING] Our team of advisors is ready to meet with you about your Full-time MBA goals. Schedule a one-on-one consultation to get started.\nWe understand that cost is an important part of the decision-making process when choosing a business school. You can feel good knowing that our Full-time MBA program features one of the lowest tuition costs among top-ranked public MBA programs in the nation. More than half of students receive merit-based funding.\n“Being a Forté Fellow has been a rewarding experience that has enriched my time in the MBA program. The resources from the scholarship program were a significant factor in enabling me to pursue my dream of an MBA. Being a fellow has provided me with access to a wide network of accomplished women who have inspired and encouraged me as I have transitioned from product operations in the tech industry to interning in corporate strategy within the automotive sector.”\n– Elizabeth Torgerson\n\nFull-time MBA '24\n*Mandatory fees cover all non-academic benefits students enjoy such as athletics, the campus recreation center (CRC), the health center, computer labs, trolleys and buses, the student center, and more. An additional $100 international student fee is required of international graduate students.\nEach year, more than half of incoming Full-time MBA students receive funding in the form of graduate assistantships or fellowships.  We remain committed to attracting students who demonstrate a passion for inclusion and add to the diversity of our community and alumni network. To that end, we offer designated awards to students from underrepresented communities each year.\nWe award assistantships to applicants who demonstrate exceptional academic and professional accomplishments in their application. Graduate assistants work with faculty and staff members for up to 14 hours per week in exchange for a monthly salary and tuition reduction. The estimated value of an assistantship may be as high as $93,000 depending on the type of award and residency status.\nWe award a variety of fellowships to applicants who exhibit exceptional academic achievements and leadership ability in their application. Upon completion of your admissions application, you will be eligible for fellowship nomination by the MBA admissions committee.\nFull-time MBA students who are U.S. citizens and permanent residents may be eligible for education loans and other financing options. Learn more through the Georgia Tech Office of Scholarships & Financial Aid. A variety of privately funded loan programs may be available for international students.\nQualified U.S. veterans may be eligible to receive financial support for tuition, mandatory fees, books, and housing. Yellow Ribbon funding is awarded on a first-come, first-serve basis, and slots are limited. Visit the Georgia Tech Registrar's Office for more information.\nAdditional information is available through the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs website.\n“The LGBTQIA+ connections I have made at ROMBA events have been invaluable during my transition into business school and my recruiting activities. I can't emphasize enough how rare and refreshing it feels to find yourself in a room full of ambitious queer people. Furthermore, the relief on the financial burden the fellowship has provided has allowed me to devote even more time to my studies, networking, and recruiting.”\n– Christian Redondo\n\nFull-time MBA '24\nThank you for requesting more information about our programs.

The ratio compares the median salary of full-time MBA program graduates to the total out-of-state tuition and fees for the two-year-program, allowing prospective students to gauge a program's cost-effectiveness.

An additional $100 international student fee is required of international graduate students.\nScholarships and Financing \nEach year, more than half of incoming Full-time MBA students receive funding in the form of graduate assistantships or fellowships.  We remain committed to attracting students who demonstrate a passion for inclusion and add to the diversity of our community and alumni network. To that end, we offer designated awards to students from underrepresented communities each year.\nGraduate Assistantships\nWe award assistantships to applicants who demonstrate exceptional academic and professional accomplishments in their application.

The ratio compares the median salary of full-time MBA program graduates to the total out-of-state tuition and fees for the two-year-program, allowing prospective students to gauge a program's cost-effectiveness. The tool can serve as a valuable indicator in assessing top-ranked programs and their potential return on investment (ROI).\n\nAccess the Tool\n“The LGBTQIA+ connections I have made at ROMBA events have been invaluable during my transition into business school and my recruiting activities.
