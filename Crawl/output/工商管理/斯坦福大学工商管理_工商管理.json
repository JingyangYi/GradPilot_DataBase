Our motto is more than words — ideas started here have fundamentally changed how the world works, connects, and lives.\nDuring your time at business school there is another change a little less quantifiable — an internal change that occurs as students become leaders by challenging themselves intellectually, engaging and collaborating with their equally driven peers, and gaining global exposure\nNo matter the end goal, our full-time, two-year MBA program will help you become a stronger leader and a better person. Immersing yourself in the program in person on campus allows for a transformative experience. Find out more about how your time at Stanford can change you.\nJoin Stanford Graduate School of Business Admissions for a series of upcoming Information Sessions around the world.\nThese events are a great opportunity to learn more about our MBA program, connect with our admissions team, and hear firsthand from alumni and students about their experiences. You’ll gain insights into our application process, academic offerings, and the vibrant GSB community.\nStanford GSB, with our campus in the heart of Silicon Valley, is a one-of-a-kind MBA program that has redefined the business school experience. Here, you’ll be pushed and challenged by best-in-class faculty and supported by your classmates in an environment unlike anywhere else. Collaboration, not competition, is key in a Stanford classroom.

Against the backdrop of beautiful California days, you’ll find life-long collaborators, mentors, and friends.\nLearn more about what it means to be part of the Stanford community, or explore more in the links below.\nA master’s degree from Stanford will take you wherever you want to go, but you have to take the first step.

Admissions events include MBA information sessions, panels, small group chats, and other opportunities to engage with students, alumni, and admissions staff around the world.\nTens of thousands of Stanford GSB alumni from around the world are hard at work, right now, changing lives, changing organizations, and changing the world. You can join them.\nIt all starts at Stanford. It all starts with your application.\nCreate or update your MBA Profile!

Obtaining an MBA is a significant investment in you and your future. We want to make sure that investment is a reasonable one.\nWe believe in accessible and attainable higher education for all and our Financial Aid Office will work with you to find the right resources for your needs. Whatever your citizenship status, whatever your financial status, once admitted, we want you here. We can help you fund your MBA through a combination of fellowship awards, student loans, summer stipends, social impact loan forgiveness programs, and other types of financial aid.\n• Why Stanford

If you are thinking about applying, we welcome you to attend an admissions event, though a visit to campus is not required or expected.\nWhether you are exploring business school for the first time or are ready to apply, find upcoming events in our schedule that meet your needs. Explore your interests and specific topics with our recorded events; your journey, your Stanford, your questions, and your application.\nHosted online and in person, information sessions are opportunities for you to get a detailed overview of the Stanford MBA Program’s distinctive features and admissions process, as well as get your questions answered. Advance registration is required.\nThese 45-minute small group events are hosted by Stanford MBA admissions officers. You have the opportunity to meet online or in person in an informal group setting. The focus of these sessions is on the application and admissions process, as well as any general questions about the Stanford MBA Program and experience. Advance registration is required.\nSpend a day on campus with us –– observe a live MBA class, chat with students, and tour the GSB with an admissions officer. Campus Visit Days are held most Mondays and Fridays during the academic year, from October to May. Registration is required and space is limited. Class visit assignments are allocated on the day of the event, and to optimize visitor experience, we present a diverse range of classes that highlight the MBA curriculum. We do our best to accommodate individual preferences when capacity and demand allow. These events are scheduled a few weeks in advance and fill up quickly. You may sign up for only one Campus Visit Day per quarter.\nWhile you are welcome to visit us, we know that not everyone can. We frequently offer admissions events online, including information sessions, regional and industry panels, MBA student experience panels, application workshops, and small group chats. We invite you to view our recorded events.

If you are not offered admission, you are welcome to apply again in a future application year.\nHaving applied in a previous year is not a negative factor in your application. We appreciate your sustained interest in Stanford and your commitment to reapplying. In fact, every year we offer admission to reapplicants who present compelling applications.\nBecause the application changes each year, you must complete a new application in the year for which you apply. Some biographical information from your previous application will carry over to your new one, although you will be able to edit all fields in your new application. You will also be required to pay the application fee unless you qualify for a fee reduction or fee waiver.\nAs long as your test scores (GMAT or GRE for general academic aptitude and TOEFL, IELTS, or PTE for English language proficiency) remain valid for the round in which you wish to apply, you do not need to retake them or have them re-sent by the test centers. If your test scores are no longer valid, you need to retake the exams.\nWe will evaluate your new application on its merits in the context of the new applicant pool. It is likely that the person reviewing your application has not seen your previous one. We do have access to previous applications, however, and may choose whether to review and consider them before making a final decision.\n• Why Stanford MBA\n• Academic Experience

To reduce the financial burden, we offer the following application fee waivers and fee reductions:\nIf you are in your final year of a bachelor’s degree or a joint bachelor/graduate program (and your degree will be conferred between 01 October 2025 and 30 September 2026) or you are currently enrolled in a graduate program (which you began immediately following an undergraduate or undergraduate/graduate program), you qualify for a reduced application fee of $100.\nThe application fee is waived for active-duty U.S. military service members, U.S. military veterans who have been honorably discharged, and those serving in the U.S. military reserves. If you are eligible for a waiver, upload one of the following documents when prompted in the online application:\nAlternatively, you may submit other documentation, but it must indicate your current military status and the date you will be separating from that status. (Do not submit a copy of your military ID.)\nIf you are from Latin America (including Puerto Rico and the Caribbean islands, Central America, Mexico, and South America, including Brazil) — and you make less than US $40,000 per year — your MBA application fee will automatically be waived in the 2025–2026 application year when you submit your application. The salary currency conversion to U.S. dollars will be calculated based on exchange rates on 16 June 2025.\nIf paying the application fee poses an extreme financial hardship, you may apply for a need-based fee waiver.

(Do not submit a copy of your military ID.)\n\n\n\n\n\nSí Se Puede Latin America Fee Waiver\n\n\n\nIf you are from Latin America (including Puerto Rico and the Caribbean islands, Central America, Mexico, and South America, including Brazil) — and you make less than US $40,000 per year — your MBA application fee will automatically be waived in the 2025–2026 application year when you submit your application. The salary currency conversion to U.S. dollars will be calculated based on exchange rates on 16 June 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed-Based Fee Waiver\n\n\n\nIf paying the application fee poses an extreme financial hardship, you may apply for a need-based fee waiver. You must complete the items below in your admissions application before requesting a waiver:\n\nHold a U.S. bachelor’s degree or international equivalent\n\nOnly under rare circumstances will we consider exceptions to this policy\n\n\nTake the required test(s) or have proof of scheduled testing before the round deadline:\n\nGMAT or GRE\nEnglish language proficiency test, if applicable\n\n\nStart an MBA application for direct admission (defer-eligible applicants qualify for a reduced fee)\nEnter your primary citizenship\nAdd your current job and employer information in Professional Experience \nUpload a current resume\n\nOnce you have finished these steps in your application, you must submit an additional form and supporting documentation. Contact admissions-mba@stanford.edu for further instructions. All materials are due by 29 August 2025. We will not consider any Round 1 fee waiver requests after this date. Waivers are offered on a first come, first served basis.\nApplication Fee Payment Method\nThe MBA Admissions Office will evaluate your application and release your decision only after you have paid the application fee (as applicable). We must receive your fee by 4:00 p.m. Pacific Time on the deadline date for the round in which you are applying.\nYou can pay the application fee by debit card (with a Visa or Mastercard logo) or by credit card while in the online application.

      "content": "[HEADING] Deadlines for Applying to the MBA Program\n[HEADING] Selecting an Application Round\n[HEADING] Decision Notification\n[HEADING] Deferral Policy\nYour completed application, including your letters of recommendation and application fee payment, is due at 4:00 p.m. Pacific Time on the deadline date for the round in which you apply.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will review information sent to the MBA Admissions Office after the deadline of the round in which you apply.\nYou may apply once per application year in any one of the three application rounds.\nDo not rush your application, but there are some advantages to applying in either Round 1 or Round 2, including:\nIf you and your partner are both applying in the same year, we strongly encourage you to apply in the same round so that you will know if your partner has been admitted by the time you have to accept or decline your offer of admission.\nIf you are interested in deferred enrollment, you may apply in any round.\nWe will post your decision to your account on the notification date above for the round in which you applied. We will also send an email to the address used to create your application profile to notify you when your decision is available.\nWe do not accommodate requests for an early decision or for decision information to be provided via phone or in person.\nIf you are offered admission, you will be expected to enroll in the MBA or dual/joint-degree program in the year for which you are admitted unless you meet the criteria for deferred enrollment. If you do not meet these criteria, we do not allow you to defer admission to a later year. Instead, we ask you to reapply. Only under rare and extraordinary circumstances (e.g., compulsory military service) will we consider exceptions to this policy.\n• Why Stanford MBA\n• Academic Experience

Only under rare and extraordinary circumstances (e.g., compulsory military service) will we consider exceptions to this policy.\nStay in Touch \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttend an Event \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApply\nStay in Touch \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttend an Event \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApply\nStay in Touch \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttend an Event \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApply\nStay in Touch \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttend an Event \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApply\nStay in Touch\nStay in Touch\nAttend an Event\nAttend an Event\n[GRID_TABLE]\nStay in Touch \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttend an Event \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApply\nStay in Touch \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttend an Event \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApply\nStay in Touch \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttend an Event \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApply\nStay in Touch\nStay in Touch\nAttend an Event\nAttend an Event\n[GRID_TABLE]\nStay in Touch \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttend an Event \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApply\nStay in Touch\nStay in Touch\nAttend an Event\nAttend an Event\n[GRID_TABLE]\nStay in Touch\nStay in Touch\nAttend an Event\nAttend an Event\n[CARD]\nStay in Touch\nStay in Touch\n[CARD]\nAttend an Event\nAttend an Event\n[CARD]\nApply\nApply\n[CARD]\nApply\n[CARD]\nClose",

But before the late-night study sessions, before your global experience, before you can get your MBA, you need to apply.\nTake a look at our entering MBA class. At Stanford GSB, you’ll find yourself surrounded by smart, driven people from all over the world aspiring to make a difference. Your colleagues will push you in ways you could never do on your own. Stanford’s culture of collaboration creates an environment unlike any other in which students learn, lead, and grow with each other. In that collaborative spirit, hear what a few students have to say about applying:\nCreate or update your MBA Profile! Head to MyStanfordGSB.Info to see a personalized dashboard for your MBA journey. The MyStanfordGSB prospect portal helps you track your application progress, register for upcoming events, and engage with stories and content relevant to you.\nThe big question on every applicant’s mind is: What is Stanford GSB looking for?\nWe won’t give you a checklist to mark off, because there isn’t one. There is no typical Stanford MBA student, no ideal for applicants to chase. Our advice is to just focus on you and ensure that your application is a true reflection of yourself.\nThat being said, we do look at some general evaluation criteria: how you think, how you lead, and how you see the world. The way you express those qualities should be authentically your own.\nAs you work through your application, our admissions office is more than happy to answer any questions after you read through this information.\nLearn from students, alumni, and staff just what makes Stanford GSB so special to them. Virtual and in-person admissions events will fill in the details about how Stanford can transform your life and career. Admissions events include MBA information sessions, regional and industry panels, small group chats, class visits, campus tours, and other chances to engage with students, alumni, and admissions staff around the world.\nJoin your student guides on an interactive tour of the Stanford GSB campus.\nWe want everyone to have access to our website.

There is no processing fee and the FAFSA is required for all federal student aid eligibility. The FAFSA will ask you to report the prior, prior year’s tax information.\nAll admitted students who want to be considered for a Stanford GSB fellowship and/or loans must complete the institutional application. You are expected to provide information for yourself and, if applicable, your spouse. There is no processing fee.\nIf you are a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, you will provide signed copies of your completed U.S. federal tax returns for the prior two years to the financial aid office, including copies of all schedules and copies of your W-2 forms. If applicable, you will submit copies of your spouse’s information as well.\nIf you are an international student, provide copies of your tax statements for the last two years from all countries in which you worked, including wage statements, to the financial aid office.\nMore details about submitting your tax forms will be provided once you are admitted to Stanford GSB.\nOnce you’ve completed the required forms, we determine your financial need and the amount of aid we can offer. The Stanford GSB Financial Aid Office defines “need” as:\nYou may be notified by our office to submit additional forms in order to complete the financial aid application process.\nFederal law specifically states that we cannot include consumer debts (e.g., credit cards, consumer loans, car loans) in the student budget. Therefore, we are unable to increase your cost of attendance to demonstrate additional financial aid eligibility to assist you in making payments for such debt. Moreover, we will not be able to decrease the value of your assets by the amount of consumer debt.\nWhile most U.S. government educational loans have deferment options for students enrolled at least half time in an educational program, some educational loans may not. We cannot take these loans into consideration while determining your fellowship eligibility.\n• Why Stanford MBA\n• Academic Experience                            \n\n\n

There is no processing fee and the FAFSA is required for all federal student aid eligibility. The FAFSA will ask you to report the prior, prior year’s tax information.\nInstitutional Application\nAll admitted students who want to be considered for a Stanford GSB fellowship and/or loans must complete the institutional application. You are expected to provide information for yourself and, if applicable, your spouse. There is no processing fee.\nTax Returns or Statements\nIf you are a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, you will provide signed copies of your completed U.S. federal tax returns for the prior two years to the financial aid office, including copies of all schedules and copies of your W-2 forms. If applicable, you will submit copies of your spouse’s information as well.\nIf you are an international student, provide copies of your tax statements for the last two years from all countries in which you worked, including wage statements, to the financial aid office.\nMore details about submitting your tax forms will be provided once you are admitted to Stanford GSB.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Financial Need\nOnce you’ve completed the required forms, we determine your financial need and the amount of aid we can offer.

Therefore, we are unable to increase your cost of attendance to demonstrate additional financial aid eligibility to assist you in making payments for such debt. Moreover, we will not be able to decrease the value of your assets by the amount of consumer debt.\n\n\nShow More \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Educational Loans\n\n\nWhile most U.S. government educational loans have deferment options for students enrolled at least half time in an educational program, some educational loans may not. We cannot take these loans into consideration while determining your fellowship eligibility.\n\n\nShow More \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn About the Types of Aid Available to You \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay in Touch \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttend an Event \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApply \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                    Apply\n                                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                    Attend an Event\n                                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                    Stay in Touch\n                                \n\n\nMore\n\n\nClose\nOnce you are admitted to Stanford GSB, we will provide you with all the information and guidance you need to apply for financial aid.\nYou will renew your financial aid application each year you are enrolled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Required Application Materials\n\n\n\nStudent\nMaterials to Submit\n\n\nUS Citizen or Permanent Resident\n\n\nFree Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)\nInstitutional application\nFederal tax returns from two prior years, including all forms, schedules,\n\t\t\t\tW-2s, and confirmation of tax filing status\nMost recent pay stub\n\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\nInstitutional application\nMost recent tax statements for the last two years from all countries in which you worked, including wage statements\nMost recent pay stub\n\n\n\n\n\nFree Application for Federal Student Aid\nAll U.S. citizens or permanent resident aid applicants must complete the FAFSA.

      "content": "[HEADING] Yellow Ribbon Program\nStanford GSB participates in the Post-9/11 Veterans Education Assistance Act of 2008, the Yellow Ribbon Program, a grant that is available to eligible military candidates.\nStanford GSB will match up to full tuition and mandatory fees (minus Stanford medical insurance*) for MBA students who are Yellow Ribbon-eligible and opt to receive these benefits. These students will not be eligible to receive additional need-based fellowships but are eligible for student loans if needed. All other MBA veteran students who are not eligible for Yellow Ribbon or vocational rehabilitation are encouraged to apply for need-based fellowships to help supplement their VA benefits.\nEligibility criteria require that you fall into one of these categories:\nThe Office for Military-Affiliated Communities serves as the liaison between the university, its students, and the various federal, state, and local agencies concerned with veterans’ benefits. Review the website for additional information about education benefits for veterans at Stanford.\n*Yellow Ribbon match does not cover medical insurance since veterans have primary coverage through the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.\n• Why Stanford MBA\n• Academic Experience                            \n\n\n                      Curriculum                            \n\n\n

      "content": "[HEADING] Knight-Hennessy Scholars Program\n[HEADING] Katherine Tang\n[HEADING] From Our Students\n[HEADING] Wasan Kumar\n[HEADING] Kelly McFarlane\n[HEADING] Bryce Marion\nThe Knight-Hennessy Scholars program is designed to build a multidisciplinary community of Stanford graduate students dedicated to finding creative solutions to the world’s greatest challenges.\nAs a Knight-Hennessy Scholar, you will develop a deep academic foundation and the broad skill set to develop creative solutions to effect positive change in the world. You will be part of a unique community of change agents from a diverse range of backgrounds.\n\"I am profoundly grateful to be a part of the Knight-Hennessy community, a fantastic complement to GSB. With scholars spanning across Stanford's graduate programs — all of whom are kind, bright, and inspiring — we have an unparalleled opportunity to stretch interdisciplinary thinking and global mindedness, essential ingredients to tackle the biggest challenges our world faces today. Knight-Hennessy is a place where I expect to grow as a leader for decades to come.\"\nThe Knight-Hennessy Scholars program is the largest fully endowed scholars program in the world. The program awards high-achieving students every year with full funding to pursue any graduate degree at Stanford, including joint and dual degrees. To be considered, you must apply separately to the Knight-Hennessy Scholars program and to your Stanford GSB graduate degree program (by Round 1).\n\"I am thrilled to be a part of the Knight-Hennessy community during my time at the GSB. Through this program, I have had the chance to meet exceptional scholars in a wide variety of fields and join seminars on topics that opened my mind to new possibilities. The GSB experience and Knight-Hennessy community push me to think deeply about my values and leadership style, and importantly have helped me build friendships that I will carry lifelong.\"\n“I am fortunate to have the incredible opportunity to work with and learn from remarkable classmates, professors, and leaders on a daily basis. In addition to the amazing MBA community, the Knight-Hennessy program fosters an interdisciplinary network of diverse individuals from across Stanford graduate schools, many of whom I likely would not have had the chance to meet otherwise. Both the Knight-Hennessy program and the GSB have challenged me to think differently, push boundaries, and leave my comfort zone in pursuit of my passions to change the world around us for the better.”\n“The Knight-Hennessy community has been a powerful catalyst for creativity and connection—through it, I’ve honed a storytelling skillset that transcends disciplines and embraced the opportunity to act as a node across campus, connecting people around shared interests and ideas. From curiosity-driven seminars to retreats that stretch the emotional core, Knight-Hennessy has expanded my sense of purpose and deepened the friendships that define my Stanford journey.”\n• Why

Our community is committed to providing you the opportunity to attend Stanford GSB regardless of your financial resources.\nStanford GSB can help you fund your MBA through a combination of student loans and generous fellowship awards. Fellowships are offered to those with demonstrated need.\nAll MBA students who have demonstrated need, regardless of citizenship, are eligible for financial aid. Fellowships are gifts from our community, and they do not have to be repaid. The average Stanford GSB fellowship for the class of 2025 was approximately $50,000 per year or $100,000 in total awards.\nStanford MBA Program admission is need-blind. We do not consider your personal resources for financing your education in our admission decisions.\nIn the admissions process, we seek to learn about how you think, how you lead, and how you see the world. These admission decisions do not consider how you will finance your MBA degree — they are made before you submit a financial aid application.\nOnce you have been admitted, we calculate an expected student contribution based on your particular financial situation. We provide aid to U.S. citizens and permanent residents as well as to international students who have demonstrated need.\nAll students are expected to contribute a portion of their income and assets to funding their Stanford MBA. Students are encouraged to repay consumer debt before applying for financial aid at Stanford GSB. The difference between the cost of attendance and the expected student contribution is then covered by a combination of fellowships and loans. Stanford GSB fellowships will be awarded based solely on your demonstrated financial need.\nThe financial aid office staff is available to answer questions about the application process and policies at any time. However, due to the large number of applications for admission to the Stanford MBA Program, the financial aid office reviews and awards financial aid to admitted students only.\n• Why Stanford MBA\n•

You meet smart, capable people in classes and in the community. I started to think about what I want in my career, what really matters to me, and where my passion for climate comes from. You learn leadership and development of soft skills at Stanford, and the climate field will need new leaders who can turn ideas into reality.
