You will learn about innovation and the impact of disruptive technologies, such as digital platforms that create new markets, and how transformation occurs whilst protecting consumers and building market resilience to achieve lasting social good, and how greater environmental awareness is impacting and changing market behaviours.\nDesigning, forming, and leading organisations provides people with essential livelihoods. Doing this with a shared sense of purpose enables the organisation to amplify its social good across many markets and countries.\nWithin a good governance structure, we examine what leaders do to motivate and empower employees, shape cultures, drive change, resolve conflicts and increase inclusion using power and effective decision-making.\nWe will explore a range of human interaction techniques including motivation and rewards, job design, teamworking, and leadership. From this you will enhance your team-working skills, leadership profile, and your interpersonal effectiveness.\nYou will hear from experienced and successful leaders of the challenges they faced in their careers and the lessons that were learned leading to their improved practice.\nWe are all consumers and the targets of marketing activity from many organisations. But do we really understand why these companies do what they do for us? How do they know what products we want, how much we are prepared to pay, where we want to buy them, or how we want to be spoken to?\nYou will explore how companies create valuable relationships in a context of changing consumer behaviour, varied needs, dynamic market conditions, and unrelenting global competition.\nThis takes place in an era of improving professional standards as the marketplace rewards ethical marketing, transparency, customer engagement, and responsible consumption.\nYou will learn through case studies and from discussions with a range of expert practitioners.\nWell-designed and well-managed operational systems that align with an organisation’s strategy are central to achieving and sustaining high levels of performance.\nWe focus on contemporary and emerging practice across the industrial, service, public, and not-for-profit sectors, emphasising high-performing operational processes capable of delivering an organisation’s products and services efficiently and effectively.\nYou will be able to assess the challenges in managing complex operations, projects, and supply chains to deliver high-quality outcomes, using Lean techniques and Six Sigma.

How can they develop effective strategies to address sustainability challenges such as climate change, and how can those strategies play a fundamental role in core company performance and success?\nThis sustainable business simulation tackles these questions in an innovative way. Students gain first-hand experience of leadership roles in sustainability, and the complexities of creating sustainability strategies to ensure ‘shared value’ for companies, their stakeholders, and the environment. They learn how to defend those strategies in a board conference with experienced business practitioners, and how to approach a sustainability crisis through a simulated press conference with real journalists.\nThe aim is: student understanding of what is required to be a responsible business leader.\nIdentifying, defining, and solving problems is key to a thriving society and economy.\nWhether working individually, within an organisation, or setting up a new business, it is your entrepreneurial skills that will enable you to establish new sources of value.\nChallenges and opportunities come in many forms.

For a general qualification, choose four electives from the following list:\nThe module examines the ethical and practical justifications for the idea that companies should operate in the interests of shareholders and also the counter arguments in favour of a stakeholder perspective.\nThe module then deals in turn with the major financial decisions made in organisations (capital budgeting, capital structure, dividends, mergers, working capital). Decisions are analysed first in the context of well functioning capital markets. Capital market imperfections and behavioural biases on the part of managers and investors are then considered.\nThis module examines ethical issues and dilemmas, covering a range of complex and controversial problems relating to business in a global economy. The main concepts and theories underpinning the business ethics field will be introduced, and you shall have the opportunity to apply these to business situations.\nMore specifically, the module explores pertinent issues of human rights, globalisation and sustainable development, and places these within different philosophical and cultural perspectives. The module also explores the role of professionals from an ethical perspective, and situates these explorations within a political-economic framework.\nGame theory is used to analyse and predict the outcomes of complex situations involving strategic interactions, ie interactions in which the right choice for us depends upon the choices made by others, and our choices affect how others behave. Managers face strategic interactions within the firm (with other divisions and subordinates) and outside the firm, with suppliers, competitors, customers, regulators, and even capital markets. Examples include pricing decisions in oligopolistic markets, entry or exit decisions, incentive schemes, and optimal timing to release information.\nIn this module, you will learn the essential tools of game theory, discover their use by applying them to a variety of business situations and cases, and find out which are its limitations. It aims at developing your ability to think ahead and to take into account other people’s possible responses to your actions. More importantly, we’ll discuss how to choose or design the best “game”. After all, “successful business strategy is about actively shaping the game you play, not just playing the game you find” (Brandegurger and Nalebuff, 1995).\nThe aim of this module to understand the different factors that support innovative performance within firms. First, we look at innovation from an industrial perspective, showing how innovations of product, process and organisational structure can create and destroy markets. Then we consider innovation within an organisation, showing how innovation can be used to address social, environmental and governance challenges. Finally, we look at innovation from a managerial perspective, highlighting the entrepreneurial practices necessary to sustain innovation. We draw upon live cases of innovation within small, fast-growing firms and learn from approaches used to re-vitalise larger firms.\nParticipants choose which firm they wish to work upon and research the historical innovation performance of that firm and recommend a change programme for senior managers to act upon. This equips participants with the knowledge to manage innovation within their sector of interest and helps build their capability to respond to uncertainty and change.\nThis module engages with contemporary challenges and issues in governance, ethics and risk in complex healthcare systems. The module brings together academic theory drawn from both the study of high-performing healthcare organisations and major organisational crises and disasters, as well as exploring and applying insights and models from other sectors. The issues examined throughout the module reflect current concerns in health policy and practice, with a particular focus on the UK health and care context.\nThe module explores difficult ethical issues, the management of risk and the governance of healthcare in broader historical and social context, and examines both the practical application of, and challenges inherent to, major tools and techniques used in healthcare. The module provides a detailed examination of key concepts of governance and ethics; major developments in NHS policy; challenges in the governance of risk, safety and resilience; and practices and theories of healthcare improvement.\nIn all health service organisations, services are evolving formally and informally. This module will look at the formal ways in which services change, in response to changing health needs and thus commissioning processes; and how organisations can respond through effective service re-design.\nVenture Capital and Private Equity (VC&PE) provide risk capital to firms at various stages of their life cycle, from selecting early-stage young firms to identifying late-stage investment opportunities such buyouts.\nThis module examines how VC&PE firms operate from both the investor and investee perspective. It looks at due diligence, firm section, structuring deals, valuation, managing portfolio firms, and exit. Cases discussed range from seed funding to management buyouts (MBOs) and bolt-ons to turnarounds and are often accompanied by industry experts in class.\nThe International Study Tour (IST) offers an exciting opportunity to appreciate the dynamics of contemporary business practice in an international context. It comprises a mixture of preparatory classroom learning and research, and field visits to organisations in the destination country, and meetings with senior managers.\nThe IST provides a great opportunity to reflect on the application of theory to practical business management issues in different environments, namely national, corporate and consumer cultural contexts and business environments. A range of sectors, industries, and company sizes are included to maximise alignment to students’ interests.\nThe IST has visited USA and China. The destination each year is based on the benefit that the destination country adds to the experience but may be affected by regulatory and logistical constraints. Assessment mirrors the innovative nature of the module and includes reflection on personal learning.\nWhy focus on business-to-business marketing? It is believed that between 50% and as much as 80% of all marketing related jobs and associated economic activity are in business markets. New perspectives in business marketing have emerged that focus on intangible resources, the co-creation of value, and relationships in networks of organisations rather than the traditional buyer-seller dyadic view of markets and marketing.\nThe aim of this module is to provide an introduction to the main theoretical and managerial concepts and issues in the area of business-to-business marketing and strategic market relations. We explore the complex dynamics of networked relationships between buying and selling organisations. Such networks offer organisations the opportunity to learn and create value in novel and innovative ways. However, they also constrain the actions of individual organisations in the network. Thus, strategic market relations require firms to understand how to build, manage, and leverage their market relationships.\nVarying in size and type, projects are literally everywhere. They are vital to all sectors and all business functions and are key platforms for improved performance and enhanced competitiveness. However, many projects are not easy to plan, manage or control, and may fail; they may overshoot the deadline, go over budget, or not meet the specifications. Risks and uncertainty and the choice of the right methodology, further complicate planning and control and affect the chances of successful project completion.\nThe module develops knowledge of the most important project planning and control methods and techniques, both traditional and contemporary. It enhances understanding on how the variety of project management methods work through in-class applications, readings, and the use of relevant software. It addresses broader issues and challenges of managing projects successfully, including stakeholder engagement and management, risk and uncertainty, the contribution of projects to innovation, and the development of a portfolio strategy.\nThe module Global Tourism Futures is aimed at developing a critical appreciation of theoretical and practical aspects of tourism in the context of a dynamic world economy.\nThis module introduces students to the topics of sourcing, procurement and purchasing. It provides students with an appreciation and understanding of strategic sourcing, and the issues, decisions and techniques purchasing managers should be familiar with, in particular: costs related to sourcing decisions, and how to compare different sourcing alternatives; behavioural factors and the impact of incentives in sourcing and dealing with suppliers; organisational forms for purchasing and controlling of this function, centralisation of purchasing and maverick behaviour; the strategic management of the portfolio of relationships with suppliers; factors to consider when preparing for negotiations and conducting them.\nThis module will give you a holistic and robust understanding of digital transformations, complemented with a solid technical and methodological knowledge to succeed in fast paced business environments.\nWe will explore a wide range of technologies and their impact upon employees and leaders in the workplace, exploring how they can become both inhibitors and enablers of strategic change.\nYou will learn from a wide range of contemporary cases and examples, with your learning facilitated by leaders in the field.\nThe module aims to jointly develop students' knowledge on how to integrate Data Science / AI within businesses and provide an awareness and high level understanding of the full technical Data Science / AI process and core concepts. After being taught core Data Science / AI concepts students will leverage this knowledge to gain a more in depth understanding of the key elements and stages in managing and running Data Science / AI projects, from initiation to completion with the aim of ensuring students are then aware of, and be able to critically assess, potential challenges and risks and be able to devise mitigation strategies.\nThe module additionally aims to develop skills to communicate complex AI concepts, techniques, and results to non-technical stakeholders, using appropriate visualizations and presentations.\nThe primary objectives of this module are to equip students with a comprehensive understanding of the key technologies shaping the financial sector, including blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and machine learning. Participants will explore the practical applications of these technologies in finance, gaining insights into how they drive innovation and efficiency. Additionally, the module seeks to prepare students for real-world scenarios by examining cybersecurity protocols and exploring emerging trends like InsurTech and RegTech.\nFinance Leadership pathway\nHealthcare Leadership pathway\nInnovation Leadership pathway\nTechnology Leadership pathway\nManagement project, which includes the Company Based Challenge.\nAll MBA students complete a management project, giving them the opportunity to put theory into practice.

consumption of goods and services.\nWe will examine how people perceive the choices available to them, and assess the associated risks, to make optimal decisions.\nWe will also explore the nature of competition in dynamic markets, and the approaches that companies take to gain temporary and lasting advantage.\nChange is at the heart of our teaching. You will learn about innovation and the impact of disruptive technologies, such as digital platforms that create new markets, and how transformation occurs whilst protecting consumers and building market resilience to achieve lasting social good, and how greater environmental awareness is impacting and changing market behaviours.\n\n\r\n            Leading People and Organisations\r\n        \n\nDesigning, forming, and leading organisations provides people with essential livelihoods. Doing this with a shared sense of purpose enables the organisation to amplify its social good across many markets and countries.\nWithin a good governance structure, we examine what leaders do to motivate and empower employees, shape cultures, drive change, resolve conflicts and increase inclusion using power and effective decision-making.\nWe will explore a range of human interaction techniques including motivation and rewards, job design, teamworking, and leadership. From this you will enhance your team-working skills, leadership profile, and your interpersonal effectiveness.\nYou will hear from experienced and successful leaders of the challenges they faced in their careers and the lessons that were learned leading to their improved practice.\n\n\r\n            Marketing\r\n        \n\nWe are all consumers and the targets of marketing activity from many organisations. But do we really understand why these companies do what they do for us? How do they know what products we want, how much we are prepared to pay, where we want to buy them, or how we want to be spoken to?\nYou will explore how companies create valuable relationships in a context of changing consumer behaviour, varied needs, dynamic market conditions, and unrelenting global competition.\nThis takes place in an era of improving professional standards as the marketplace rewards ethical marketing, transparency, customer engagement, and responsible consumption.\nYou will learn through case studies and from discussions with a range of expert practitioners.\n\n\r\n            Operations Management\r\n        \n\nWell-designed and well-managed operational systems that align with an organisation’s strategy are central to achieving and sustaining high levels of performance.\nWe focus on contemporary and emerging practice across the industrial, service, public, and not-for-profit sectors, emphasising high-performing operational processes capable of delivering an organisation’s products and services efficiently and effectively.\nYou will be able to assess the challenges in managing complex operations, projects, and supply chains to deliver high-quality outcomes, using Lean techniques and Six Sigma. You will understand the critical importance of IT and digitally enabled systems in supporting strong operational performance.\nWe share insights from business and industry, including analysis of contemporary case studies and expert practitioner views to drive business agility, rapid fulfilment, and customer-focused product variety while promoting resource sustainability and operational resilience.\n\n\r\n            Strategic Management\r\n        \n\nStrategy is the practice of how an organisation fits within its chosen environment to ensure sustainability, competitive advantage in the good times, and resilience in more challenging times.\nYou will develop strategic analyses both for the external competitive environment and for the organisation’s internal resources and competencies, establishing priorities for where and how to focus development resources.\nEver mindful of current and emerging global competition you will use creativity and nuance to make clear the organisation’s strategic purpose, giving clarity of role to key stakeholders, and ensuring transparent governance.\nExperienced practitioners will share their successes and failures of developing and delivering business, societal, and international strategic interventions. You will learn from a dynamic blend of case studies, cutting-edge research insights, and guest speakers.\n\n\r\n            Sustainable Decisions and Organisations\r\n        \n\nHow do business leaders recognise their need to be responsible and accountable for their environmental and social impacts? How can they develop effective strategies to address sustainability challenges such as climate change, and how can those strategies play a fundamental role in core company performance and success?\nThis sustainable business simulation tackles these questions in an innovative way. Students gain first-hand experience of leadership roles in sustainability, and the complexities of creating sustainability strategies to ensure ‘shared value’ for companies, their stakeholders, and the environment. They learn how to defend those strategies in a board conference with experienced business practitioners, and how to approach a sustainability crisis through a simulated press conference with real journalists.\nThe aim is: student understanding of what is required to be a responsible business leader.\n\n\r\n            Entrepreneurship and Creativity\r\n        \n\nIdentifying, defining, and solving problems is key to a thriving society and economy.\nWhether working individually, within an organisation, or setting up a new business, it is your entrepreneurial skills that will enable you to establish new sources of value.\nChallenges and opportunities come in many forms. Whether it is the need to develop a circular economy, expand clean technologies, enable regeneration, or ensure resource sustainability for future generations, this module gives you the opportunity to make your mark.\nUsing the University’s Ingenuity™ creative problem-solving model, you will work in teams, mentored by experienced entrepreneurs, to address a practical entrepreneurial challenge.\nThis module will integrate your thinking to build your business planning and pitching skills.\n\n\nStage two: Deepening management experience\n\nHere you can choose from the full set of electives, or you can combine specific modules into a Pathway. For a general qualification, choose four electives from the following list: \n\n\n\r\n            Corporate Finance\r\n        \n\nThe module examines the ethical and practical justifications for the idea that companies should operate in the interests of shareholders and also the counter arguments in favour of a stakeholder perspective.\nThe module then deals in turn with the major financial decisions made in organisations (capital budgeting, capital structure, dividends, mergers, working capital). Decisions are analysed first in the context of well functioning capital markets. Capital market imperfections and behavioural biases on the part of managers and investors are then considered.\n\n\r\n            Business Ethics\r\n        \n\nThis module examines ethical issues and dilemmas, covering a range of complex and controversial problems relating to business in a global economy. The main concepts and theories underpinning the business ethics field will be introduced, and you shall have the opportunity to apply these to business situations.\nMore specifically, the module explores pertinent issues of human rights, globalisation and sustainable development, and places these within different philosophical and cultural perspectives. The module also explores the role of professionals from an ethical perspective, and situates these explorations within a political-economic framework.\n\n\r\n            Games and Strategies for Business\r\n        \n\nGame theory is used to analyse and predict the outcomes of complex situations involving strategic interactions, ie interactions in which the right choice for us depends upon the choices made by others, and our choices affect how others behave. Managers face strategic interactions within the firm (with other divisions and subordinates) and outside the firm, with suppliers, competitors, customers, regulators, and even capital markets. Examples include pricing decisions in oligopolistic markets, entry or exit decisions, incentive schemes, and optimal timing to release information.\nIn this module, you will learn the essential tools of game theory, discover their use by applying them to a variety of business situations and cases, and find out which are its limitations. It aims at developing your ability to think ahead and to take into account other people’s possible responses to your actions. More importantly, we’ll discuss how to choose or design the best “game”. After all, “successful business strategy is about actively shaping the game you play, not just playing the game you find” (Brandegurger and Nalebuff, 1995).\n\n\r\n            Innovation Management\r\n        \n\nThe aim of this module to understand the different factors that support innovative performance within firms. First, we look at innovation from an industrial perspective, showing how innovations of product, process and organisational structure can create and destroy markets. Then we consider innovation within an organisation, showing how innovation can be used to address social, environmental and governance challenges. Finally, we look at innovation from a managerial perspective, highlighting the entrepreneurial practices necessary to sustain innovation. We draw upon live cases of innovation within small, fast-growing firms and learn from approaches used to re-vitalise larger firms.\nParticipants choose which firm they wish to work upon and research the historical innovation performance of that firm and recommend a change programme for senior managers to act upon. This equips participants with the knowledge to manage innovation within their sector of interest and helps build their capability to respond to uncertainty and change.\n\n\r\n            Ethics, Governance and Risk\r\n        \n\nThis module engages with contemporary challenges and issues in governance, ethics and risk in complex healthcare systems. The module brings together academic theory drawn from both the study of high-performing healthcare organisations and major organisational crises and disasters, as well as exploring and applying insights and models from other sectors. The issues examined throughout the module reflect current concerns in health policy and practice, with a particular focus on the UK health and care context.\nThe module explores difficult ethical issues, the management of risk and the governance of healthcare in broader historical and social context, and examines both the practical application of, and challenges inherent to, major tools and techniques used in healthcare. The module provides a detailed examination of key concepts of governance and ethics; major developments in NHS policy; challenges in the governance of risk, safety and resilience; and practices and theories of healthcare improvement.\n\n\r\n            Commissioning and Service Redesign\r\n        \n\nIn all health service organisations, services are evolving formally and informally. This module will look at the formal ways in which services change, in response to changing health needs and thus commissioning processes; and how organisations can respond through effective service re-design.\n\n\r\n            Venture Capital and Private Equity\r\n        \n\nVenture Capital and Private Equity (VC&PE) provide risk capital to firms at various stages of their life cycle, from selecting early-stage young firms to identifying late-stage investment opportunities such buyouts.\nThis module examines how VC&PE firms operate from both the investor and investee perspective. It looks at due diligence, firm section, structuring deals, valuation, managing portfolio firms, and exit. Cases discussed range from seed funding to management buyouts (MBOs) and bolt-ons to turnarounds and are often accompanied by industry experts in class.\n\n\r\n            International Study Tour\r\n        \n\nThe International Study Tour (IST) offers an exciting opportunity to appreciate the dynamics of contemporary business practice in an international context. It comprises a mixture of preparatory classroom learning and research, and field visits to organisations in the destination country, and meetings with senior managers.\nThe IST provides a great opportunity to reflect on the application of theory to practical business management issues in different environments, namely national, corporate and consumer cultural contexts and business environments. A range of sectors, industries, and company sizes are included to maximise alignment to students’ interests.\nThe IST has visited USA and China. The destination each year is based on the benefit that the destination country adds to the experience but may be affected by regulatory and logistical constraints. Assessment mirrors the innovative nature of the module and includes reflection on personal learning.\n\n\r\n            Strategic Market Relations: Building, Managing and Leveraging Market Relationships\r\n        \n\nWhy focus on business-to-business marketing? It is believed that between 50% and as much as 80% of all marketing related jobs and associated economic activity are in business markets. New perspectives in business marketing have emerged that focus on intangible resources, the co-creation of value, and relationships in networks of organisations rather than the traditional buyer-seller dyadic view of markets and marketing.\nThe aim of this module is to provide an introduction to the main theoretical and managerial concepts and issues in the area of business-to-business marketing and strategic market relations. We explore the complex dynamics of networked relationships between buying and selling organisations. Such networks offer organisations the opportunity to learn and create value in novel and innovative ways. However, they also constrain the actions of individual organisations in the network. Thus, strategic market relations require firms to understand how to build, manage, and leverage their market relationships.\n\n\r\n            Project Management\r\n        \n\nVarying in size and type, projects are literally everywhere. They are vital to all sectors and all business functions and are key platforms for improved performance and enhanced competitiveness. However, many projects are not easy to plan, manage or control, and may fail; they may overshoot the deadline, go over budget, or not meet the specifications. Risks and uncertainty and the choice of the right methodology, further complicate planning and control and affect the chances of successful project completion.\nThe module develops knowledge of the most important project planning and control methods and techniques, both traditional and contemporary. It enhances understanding on how the variety of project management methods work through in-class applications, readings, and the use of relevant software. It addresses broader issues and challenges of managing projects successfully, including stakeholder engagement and management, risk and uncertainty, the contribution of projects to innovation, and the development of a portfolio strategy.\n\n\r\n            Global Tourism Futures \r\n        \n\nThe module Global Tourism Futures is aimed at developing a critical appreciation of theoretical and practical aspects of tourism in the context of a dynamic world economy.\n\n\r\n            Supply Chain and Procurement Management\r\n        \n\nThis module introduces students to the topics of sourcing, procurement and purchasing. It provides students with an appreciation and understanding of strategic sourcing, and the issues, decisions and techniques purchasing managers should be familiar with, in particular: costs related to sourcing decisions, and how to compare different sourcing alternatives; behavioural factors and the impact of incentives in sourcing and dealing with suppliers; organisational forms for purchasing and controlling of this function, centralisation of purchasing and maverick behaviour; the strategic management of the portfolio of relationships with suppliers; factors to consider when preparing for negotiations and conducting them.\n\n\r\n            Digital Transformation and Change Management \r\n        \n\nThis module will give you a holistic and robust understanding of digital transformations, complemented with a solid technical and methodological knowledge to succeed in fast paced business environments.\nWe will explore a wide range of technologies and their impact upon employees and leaders in the workplace, exploring how they can become both inhibitors and enablers of strategic change.\nYou will learn from a wide range of contemporary cases and examples, with your learning facilitated by leaders in the field.\n\n\r\n            Data Science, Analytics and Decision Making \r\n        \n\nThe module aims to jointly develop students' knowledge on how to integrate Data Science / AI within businesses and provide an awareness and high level understanding of the full technical Data Science / AI process and core concepts. After being taught core Data Science / AI concepts students will leverage this knowledge to gain a more in depth understanding of the key elements and stages in managing and running Data Science / AI projects, from initiation to completion with the aim of ensuring students are then aware of, and be able to critically assess, potential challenges and risks and be able to devise mitigation strategies.\nThe module additionally aims to develop skills to communicate complex AI concepts, techniques, and results to non-technical stakeholders, using appropriate visualizations and presentations.\n\n\r\n            Financial Technologies \r\n        \n\nThe primary objectives of this module are to equip students with a comprehensive understanding of the key technologies shaping the financial sector, including blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and machine learning. Participants will explore the practical applications of these technologies in finance, gaining insights into how they drive innovation and efficiency. Additionally, the module seeks to prepare students for real-world scenarios by examining cybersecurity protocols and exploring emerging trends like InsurTech and RegTech.\n\n\nTo gain a Pathway award, select three modules from the same group, then one other from the list above.\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFinance Leadership pathway \n\n\n\nCorporate Finance\nFinancial Technologies\nPortfolio Management and Investment Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\nHealthcare Leadership pathway\n\n\n\nCommissioning and Service Redesign\nEthics, Governance and Risk\nHealth Finance, Economics and Decision Making\n\n\n\n\n\nInnovation Leadership pathway\n\n\n\nEntrepreneurship in Practice\nInnovation Management\nVenture Capital & Private Equity\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnology Leadership pathway \n\n\n\nBusiness Intelligence in the Digital Economy\nData Science, Analytics and Decision Making\nDigital Transformation and Change Management\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStage three: Preparing for your future career\n\nManagement project, which includes the Company Based Challenge.\n\n\n\r\n            Management Project\r\n        \n\nAll MBA students complete a management project, giving them the opportunity to put theory into practice. You spend up to six months on a management project exploring current business issues and applying the theories and techniques learned during your MBA to resolve them.\nYou have three options. Either:\n\napply for a project with a real business (company-based management project)\ndo a desk-based project\nwrite a business plan\n\nThe specific topic is subject to an approval process.

You will learn from a dynamic blend of case studies, cutting-edge research insights, and guest speakers.\n\n\r\n            Sustainable Decisions and Organisations\r\n        \n\nHow do business leaders recognise their need to be responsible and accountable for their environmental and social impacts? How can they develop effective strategies to address sustainability challenges such as climate change, and how can those strategies play a fundamental role in core company performance and success?\nThis sustainable business simulation tackles these questions in an innovative way. Students gain first-hand experience of leadership roles in sustainability, and the complexities of creating sustainability strategies to ensure ‘shared value’ for companies, their stakeholders, and the environment. They learn how to defend those strategies in a board conference with experienced business practitioners, and how to approach a sustainability crisis through a simulated press conference with real journalists.\nThe aim is: student understanding of what is required to be a responsible business leader.\n\n\r\n            Entrepreneurship and Creativity\r\n        \n\nIdentifying, defining, and solving problems is key to a thriving society and economy.\nWhether working individually, within an organisation, or setting up a new business, it is your entrepreneurial skills that will enable you to establish new sources of value.\nChallenges and opportunities come in many forms. Whether it is the need to develop a circular economy, expand clean technologies, enable regeneration, or ensure resource sustainability for future generations, this module gives you the opportunity to make your mark.\nUsing the University’s Ingenuity™ creative problem-solving model, you will work in teams, mentored by experienced entrepreneurs, to address a practical entrepreneurial challenge.\nThis module will integrate your thinking to build your business planning and pitching skills.\n\n\nStage two: Deepening management experience\n\nHere you can choose from the full set of electives, or you can combine specific modules into a Pathway. For a general qualification, choose four electives from the following list: \n\n\n\r\n            Corporate Finance\r\n        \n\nThe module examines the ethical and practical justifications for the idea that companies should operate in the interests of shareholders and also the counter arguments in favour of a stakeholder perspective.\nThe module then deals in turn with the major financial decisions made in organisations (capital budgeting, capital structure, dividends, mergers, working capital). Decisions are analysed first in the context of well functioning capital markets. Capital market imperfections and behavioural biases on the part of managers and investors are then considered.\n\n\r\n            Business Ethics\r\n        \n\nThis module examines ethical issues and dilemmas, covering a range of complex and controversial problems relating to business in a global economy. The main concepts and theories underpinning the business ethics field will be introduced, and you shall have the opportunity to apply these to business situations.\nMore specifically, the module explores pertinent issues of human rights, globalisation and sustainable development, and places these within different philosophical and cultural perspectives. The module also explores the role of professionals from an ethical perspective, and situates these explorations within a political-economic framework.\n\n\r\n            Games and Strategies for Business\r\n        \n\nGame theory is used to analyse and predict the outcomes of complex situations involving strategic interactions, ie interactions in which the right choice for us depends upon the choices made by others, and our choices affect how others behave. Managers face strategic interactions within the firm (with other divisions and subordinates) and outside the firm, with suppliers, competitors, customers, regulators, and even capital markets. Examples include pricing decisions in oligopolistic markets, entry or exit decisions, incentive schemes, and optimal timing to release information.\nIn this module, you will learn the essential tools of game theory, discover their use by applying them to a variety of business situations and cases, and find out which are its limitations. It aims at developing your ability to think ahead and to take into account other people’s possible responses to your actions. More importantly, we’ll discuss how to choose or design the best “game”. After all, “successful business strategy is about actively shaping the game you play, not just playing the game you find” (Brandegurger and Nalebuff, 1995).\n\n\r\n            Innovation Management\r\n        \n\nThe aim of this module to understand the different factors that support innovative performance within firms. First, we look at innovation from an industrial perspective, showing how innovations of product, process and organisational structure can create and destroy markets. Then we consider innovation within an organisation, showing how innovation can be used to address social, environmental and governance challenges. Finally, we look at innovation from a managerial perspective, highlighting the entrepreneurial practices necessary to sustain innovation. We draw upon live cases of innovation within small, fast-growing firms and learn from approaches used to re-vitalise larger firms.\nParticipants choose which firm they wish to work upon and research the historical innovation performance of that firm and recommend a change programme for senior managers to act upon. This equips participants with the knowledge to manage innovation within their sector of interest and helps build their capability to respond to uncertainty and change.\n\n\r\n            Ethics, Governance and Risk\r\n        \n\nThis module engages with contemporary challenges and issues in governance, ethics and risk in complex healthcare systems. The module brings together academic theory drawn from both the study of high-performing healthcare organisations and major organisational crises and disasters, as well as exploring and applying insights and models from other sectors. The issues examined throughout the module reflect current concerns in health policy and practice, with a particular focus on the UK health and care context.\nThe module explores difficult ethical issues, the management of risk and the governance of healthcare in broader historical and social context, and examines both the practical application of, and challenges inherent to, major tools and techniques used in healthcare. The module provides a detailed examination of key concepts of governance and ethics; major developments in NHS policy; challenges in the governance of risk, safety and resilience; and practices and theories of healthcare improvement.\n\n\r\n            Commissioning and Service Redesign\r\n        \n\nIn all health service organisations, services are evolving formally and informally. This module will look at the formal ways in which services change, in response to changing health needs and thus commissioning processes; and how organisations can respond through effective service re-design.\n\n\r\n            Venture Capital and Private Equity\r\n        \n\nVenture Capital and Private Equity (VC&PE) provide risk capital to firms at various stages of their life cycle, from selecting early-stage young firms to identifying late-stage investment opportunities such buyouts.\nThis module examines how VC&PE firms operate from both the investor and investee perspective. It looks at due diligence, firm section, structuring deals, valuation, managing portfolio firms, and exit. Cases discussed range from seed funding to management buyouts (MBOs) and bolt-ons to turnarounds and are often accompanied by industry experts in class.\n\n\r\n            International Study Tour\r\n        \n\nThe International Study Tour (IST) offers an exciting opportunity to appreciate the dynamics of contemporary business practice in an international context. It comprises a mixture of preparatory classroom learning and research, and field visits to organisations in the destination country, and meetings with senior managers.\nThe IST provides a great opportunity to reflect on the application of theory to practical business management issues in different environments, namely national, corporate and consumer cultural contexts and business environments. A range of sectors, industries, and company sizes are included to maximise alignment to students’ interests.\nThe IST has visited USA and China. The destination each year is based on the benefit that the destination country adds to the experience but may be affected by regulatory and logistical constraints. Assessment mirrors the innovative nature of the module and includes reflection on personal learning.\n\n\r\n            Strategic Market Relations: Building, Managing and Leveraging Market Relationships\r\n        \n\nWhy focus on business-to-business marketing? It is believed that between 50% and as much as 80% of all marketing related jobs and associated economic activity are in business markets. New perspectives in business marketing have emerged that focus on intangible resources, the co-creation of value, and relationships in networks of organisations rather than the traditional buyer-seller dyadic view of markets and marketing.\nThe aim of this module is to provide an introduction to the main theoretical and managerial concepts and issues in the area of business-to-business marketing and strategic market relations. We explore the complex dynamics of networked relationships between buying and selling organisations. Such networks offer organisations the opportunity to learn and create value in novel and innovative ways. However, they also constrain the actions of individual organisations in the network. Thus, strategic market relations require firms to understand how to build, manage, and leverage their market relationships.\n\n\r\n            Project Management\r\n        \n\nVarying in size and type, projects are literally everywhere. They are vital to all sectors and all business functions and are key platforms for improved performance and enhanced competitiveness. However, many projects are not easy to plan, manage or control, and may fail; they may overshoot the deadline, go over budget, or not meet the specifications. Risks and uncertainty and the choice of the right methodology, further complicate planning and control and affect the chances of successful project completion.\nThe module develops knowledge of the most important project planning and control methods and techniques, both traditional and contemporary. It enhances understanding on how the variety of project management methods work through in-class applications, readings, and the use of relevant software. It addresses broader issues and challenges of managing projects successfully, including stakeholder engagement and management, risk and uncertainty, the contribution of projects to innovation, and the development of a portfolio strategy.\n\n\r\n            Global Tourism Futures \r\n        \n\nThe module Global Tourism Futures is aimed at developing a critical appreciation of theoretical and practical aspects of tourism in the context of a dynamic world economy.\n\n\r\n            Supply Chain and Procurement Management\r\n        \n\nThis module introduces students to the topics of sourcing, procurement and purchasing. It provides students with an appreciation and understanding of strategic sourcing, and the issues, decisions and techniques purchasing managers should be familiar with, in particular: costs related to sourcing decisions, and how to compare different sourcing alternatives; behavioural factors and the impact of incentives in sourcing and dealing with suppliers; organisational forms for purchasing and controlling of this function, centralisation of purchasing and maverick behaviour; the strategic management of the portfolio of relationships with suppliers; factors to consider when preparing for negotiations and conducting them.\n\n\r\n            Digital Transformation and Change Management \r\n        \n\nThis module will give you a holistic and robust understanding of digital transformations, complemented with a solid technical and methodological knowledge to succeed in fast paced business environments.\nWe will explore a wide range of technologies and their impact upon employees and leaders in the workplace, exploring how they can become both inhibitors and enablers of strategic change.\nYou will learn from a wide range of contemporary cases and examples, with your learning facilitated by leaders in the field.\n\n\r\n            Data Science, Analytics and Decision Making \r\n        \n\nThe module aims to jointly develop students' knowledge on how to integrate Data Science / AI within businesses and provide an awareness and high level understanding of the full technical Data Science / AI process and core concepts. After being taught core Data Science / AI concepts students will leverage this knowledge to gain a more in depth understanding of the key elements and stages in managing and running Data Science / AI projects, from initiation to completion with the aim of ensuring students are then aware of, and be able to critically assess, potential challenges and risks and be able to devise mitigation strategies.\nThe module additionally aims to develop skills to communicate complex AI concepts, techniques, and results to non-technical stakeholders, using appropriate visualizations and presentations.\n\n\r\n            Financial Technologies \r\n        \n\nThe primary objectives of this module are to equip students with a comprehensive understanding of the key technologies shaping the financial sector, including blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and machine learning. Participants will explore the practical applications of these technologies in finance, gaining insights into how they drive innovation and efficiency. Additionally, the module seeks to prepare students for real-world scenarios by examining cybersecurity protocols and exploring emerging trends like InsurTech and RegTech.\n\n\nTo gain a Pathway award, select three modules from the same group, then one other from the list above.\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFinance Leadership pathway \n\n\n\nCorporate Finance\nFinancial Technologies\nPortfolio Management and Investment Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\nHealthcare Leadership pathway\n\n\n\nCommissioning and Service Redesign\nEthics, Governance and Risk\nHealth Finance, Economics and Decision Making\n\n\n\n\n\nInnovation Leadership pathway\n\n\n\nEntrepreneurship in Practice\nInnovation Management\nVenture Capital & Private Equity\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnology Leadership pathway \n\n\n\nBusiness Intelligence in the Digital Economy\nData Science, Analytics and Decision Making\nDigital Transformation and Change Management\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStage three: Preparing for your future career\n\nManagement project, which includes the Company Based Challenge.\n\n\n\r\n            Management Project\r\n        \n\nAll MBA students complete a management project, giving them the opportunity to put theory into practice. You spend up to six months on a management project exploring current business issues and applying the theories and techniques learned during your MBA to resolve them.\nYou have three options. Either:\n\napply for a project with a real business (company-based management project)\ndo a desk-based project\nwrite a business plan\n\nThe specific topic is subject to an approval process.

Evidence of relevant personal, professional and educational experience may be taken into consideration. Generally an undergraduate degree will be required, but we may be able to consider experience-based qualifications on a case-by-case basis. Contact the academic school directly for further information.\nInternational and EU students can find guidance on alternative qualifications on our country-specific webpages.\nAll applicants, both home and international, are required to hold English language qualifications at an appropriate level in order to study at the university. If you're a native English speaker, or you have studied in an English-speaking country or institution, we may be able to accept your academic qualifications as evidence of your English language ability.\nIELTS requirements are detailed on our course pages, though we also accept a variety of alternative qualifications.\nIf you require additional support to develop your language skills, you may be able to attend a pre-sessional course at the Centre for English Language Education.\nSome courses require work experience, or other entry requirements, or to demonstrate knowledge of the course. Please check our course pages for details.\nTeaching for most postgraduate taught courses starts late September, while some have alternative start dates. Check course pages for details on start dates and course specific deadlines.\nFor standard late September starts, the application deadline is usually around six to seven weeks before the start date for international applicants. For specific dates for international and home applicants, please check our application deadline information.\nWe will endeavour to make a decision on your application within six weeks of submitting your application and paying your application fee (if required).\nInternational applicants, you should apply as early as possible to ensure that you have enough time to apply for your student visa. If you are successful in receiving an offer, you will need to accept it and meet any outstanding conditions by early September (for our late September start), or as advised by the admissions team.\nAn offer of study is required for many funding opportunities. You should check deadlines for applications carefully, as these are often early in the year. Please apply early and allow time for any fee payments and your application to be processed to avoid disappointment. If you have a known deadline for funding (for example, scholarship, sponsorship etc), we encourage you to make us aware of it in your application.\nYou can apply directly through our online system. You will receive automatic confirmation once you submit your application and can track its progress.\nMake sure that you upload clear scanned copies of your degree certificate (if completed) and final or current transcript, as well as any other supporting documents. We will not be able to assess your application without them. Please do not send us the original copies in the post, as we will be unable to return these.\nDepending on the course you are applying for, you may also need to provide two references, including at least one who can comment on your academic ability. These must be dated within two years of the date of your application and, if not submitted directly by your referee, signed and on letter-headed paper. We may also require a personal statement. If you aren't sure what to include or need more help, please refer to our guidance or contact us.\nApplications for teacher training are made through DfE Apply and MA Social Work are made through UCAS.\nYour application provides an opportunity for you to articulate the skills and experiences you have that make you suitable for a place on our courses. We understand that AI tools can be beneficial in terms of helping you to structure things such as personal statements, or to check for readability. However, please be aware that an over-reliance on AI carries risks, such as falsely generated claims and the potential for the generated work to be of poor quality. Generating all, or a large part of your application submissions and communications regarding your application, using an AI tool and presenting this as your own work or words could affect the outcome of your application.\nThere is an application fee of £50 for postgraduate taught courses.\nApply online\nYou can log in at any time to track the progress of your application.\nTrack your application\nInternational students who are planning to start a full-time postgraduate taught course will be required to pay a tuition fee deposit of at least £3,000 for start dates between August 2025 and July 2026, or £4,500 for start dates from August 2026 onwards, as part of the visa process.\nWe will waive the tuition fee deposit requirement for students who are fully sponsored by a recognised sponsor. If you are fully sponsored for your course fees, you must email us a copy of your sponsorship letter, quoting your full name and application ID.\nThe university will only accept sponsorship letters from recognised sponsors such as overseas governments, international businesses, universities, trusts and charities, and not from friends/family members.\nAdmissions may, at their discretion, ask applicants to provide further information in order to assess their application fairly and accurately. This can include CVs, references (academic and professional) and clarifications regarding their previous and current education.
