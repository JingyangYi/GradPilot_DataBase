      "content": "[HEADING] MBA Curriculum\n[HEADING] First-semester core: your cohort, your team\n[HEADING] Required core courses\n[HEADING] Core electives (select one)\n[HEADING] Beyond core: electives, certificates, and more\n[HEADING] Dual and Joint Degrees\n[HEADING] MIT Leaders for Global Operations\n[HEADING] MIT Sloan and MIT Department of Urban Studies and Planning\n[HEADING] MIT Sloan and Harvard Kennedy School of Government\nThe two-year, full-time MBA program provides the intellectual discovery and expert faculty you‚Äôd expect from MIT, combined with the flexibility to customize coursework to your goals. After the first-semester core, you can choose your electives‚Äîand real-world learning opportunities‚Äîto ensure that you‚Äôre prepared to analyze and act.\nDuring your first semester here, also called the core semester, you'll be carefully grouped¬†into one of six cohorts of¬†students¬†from a rich mix of backgrounds, interests, and experiences. Following MIT Sloan tradition, each cohort is named after a body of water: Atlantic, Baltic, Caribbean, Indian, Mediterranean, and Pacific. Each cohort is then divided into smaller teams. These teams and cohorts move through the core semester together, creating a strong, supportive bond that lasts throughout the MBA experience, and beyond.\nLeadership Challenges for an Inclusive World, Economic Analysis for Business Decisions, Data Models and Decisions, Communication for Leaders, Organizational Processes, Financial Accounting\nManagerial Finance, Intro to Operations Management, Competitive Strategy, Marketing Innovation\nMBA Course Descriptions\nAfter the first-semester core, you¬†have three semesters to create a program that‚Äôs right for you.¬†In total, you'll complete 144 units of electives. You may also take up to three approved, non-MIT Sloan graduate-level MIT or Harvard subjects. Some students opt to write a thesis in their second year.\nWorking across campus with students and faculty from other disciplines is one of the most exciting opportunities at MIT Sloan. These cross-campus connections spark¬†new ideas, new products, and new companies.\nMIT Sloan¬†also offers seven certificates¬†so you can focus your studies and dive deep into what interests you.\nYour talents, interests, and career goals may extend beyond management. MIT Sloan offers dual and joint degrees designed to prepare you for complex leadership challenges that combine industry expertise with critical management skills.\nThe¬†LGO program¬†allows you to leverage the tools you gain in our MBA/MS from the Sloan School of Management and School of Engineering at MIT to become an innovative business leader with the technical skills to implement complex operations and technology solutions. Earn 2 degrees in 2 years where you will build a customizable program experience that allows you to pursue research interests, MIT resources, and career opportunities that fit your goals.\nMIT Sloan and the MIT Department of Urban Studies (DUSP) offers a dual-degree program allowing students to pursue an MBA and a master's degree in city planning. Students must apply to both programs concurrently and submit their application to MIT Sloan during Round 2. Students must spend one full academic year at each program, then split the third academic year with primary registration in each program for one additional semester.\nThis dual-degree program with the¬†Harvard University Kennedy School of Government¬†enables students to receive both an MBA and a Masters in Public Administration or a Masters in Public Policy in three years.\nThe program is especially relevant for those students who plan to pursue careers in international management or economic development or who plan to work in industries or regions with a high degree of government partnership or regulation.¬† Students must apply to both programs concurrently and submit their applications to MIT Sloan during Round 2.\nStudents admitted to MIT Sloan and HKS must begin their studies at HKS. Students will spend one full academic year in residence at each program, then split the third academic year. Students will be assessed the tuition charged at the program of their primary registration in a given semester. Completion of the two degrees in three years requires careful academic planning to earn credits toward both degrees. The dual degree advisor is available to help coordinate a plan of study. Students are responsible for understanding and completing all requirements of both the MIT Sloan and HKS degrees.\n‚Ä¢ Required core courses\t\t\n\n\n\nLeadership Challenges for an Inclusive World, Economic Analysis for Business Decisions, Data Models and Decisions, Communication for Leaders, Organizational Processes, Financial Accounting\n‚Ä¢ Core electives (select one)\t\t\n\n\n\nManagerial Finance, Intro to Operations Management, Competitive Strategy, Marketing Innovation\n‚Ä¢ Business Analytics Certificate\nAnalytics Certificate\n‚Ä¢ PM Certificate\nProduct Management Certificate\n‚Ä¢ EM Certificate\nEnterprise Management Certificate\n‚Ä¢ Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship\nEntrepreneurship & Innovation Certificate\n‚Ä¢ Finance\nFinance Certificate\n‚Ä¢ MIT Sloan Health Systems Initiative\nHealthcare Certificate\n‚Ä¢ MIT Sloan Sustainability Initiative\nSustainability Certificate\n[GRID_TABLE]\nRequired core courses\t\t\n\n\n\nLeadership Challenges for an Inclusive World, Economic Analysis for Business Decisions, Data Models and Decisions, Communication for Leaders, Organizational Processes, Financial Accounting¬†\n\n\nCore electives (select one)\t\t\n\n\n\nManagerial Finance, Intro to Operations Management, Competitive Strategy, Marketing Innovation\nRequired core courses\t\t\n\n\n\nLeadership Challenges for an Inclusive World, Economic Analysis for Business Decisions, Data Models and Decisions, Communication for Leaders, Organizational Processes, Financial Accounting¬†\n\n\nCore electives (select one)\t\t\n\n\n\nManagerial Finance, Intro to Operations Management, Competitive Strategy, Marketing Innovation\nRequired core courses\t\t\n\n\n\nLeadership Challenges for an Inclusive World, Economic Analysis for Business Decisions, Data Models and Decisions, Communication for Leaders, Organizational Processes, Financial Accounting\nRequired core courses\nLeadership Challenges for an Inclusive World, Economic Analysis for Business Decisions, Data Models and Decisions, Communication for Leaders, Organizational Processes, Financial Accounting\nCore electives (select one)\t\t\n\n\n\nManagerial Finance, Intro to Operations Management, Competitive Strategy, Marketing Innovation\nCore electives (select one)\nManagerial Finance, Intro to Operations Management, Competitive Strategy, Marketing Innovation\n[GRID_TABLE]\nRequired core courses\t\t\n\n\n\nLeadership Challenges for an Inclusive World, Economic Analysis for Business Decisions, Data Models and Decisions, Communication for Leaders, Organizational Processes, Financial Accounting¬†\n\n\nCore electives (select one)\t\t\n\n\n\nManagerial Finance, Intro to Operations Management, Competitive Strategy, Marketing Innovation\nRequired core courses\t\t\n\n\n\nLeadership Challenges for an Inclusive World, Economic Analysis for Business Decisions, Data Models and Decisions, Communication for Leaders, Organizational Processes, Financial Accounting\nRequired core courses\nLeadership Challenges for an Inclusive World, Economic Analysis for Business Decisions, Data Models and Decisions, Communication for Leaders, Organizational Processes, Financial Accounting\nCore electives (select one)\t\t\n\n\n\nManagerial Finance, Intro to Operations Management, Competitive Strategy, Marketing Innovation\nCore electives (select one)\nManagerial Finance, Intro to Operations Management, Competitive Strategy, Marketing Innovation\n[GRID_TABLE]\nRequired core courses\t\t\n\n\n\nLeadership Challenges for an Inclusive World, Economic Analysis for Business Decisions, Data Models and Decisions, Communication for Leaders, Organizational Processes, Financial Accounting\nRequired core courses\nLeadership Challenges for an Inclusive World, Economic Analysis for Business Decisions, Data Models and Decisions, Communication for Leaders, Organizational Processes, Financial Accounting\nCore electives (select one)\t\t\n\n\n\nManagerial Finance, Intro to Operations Management, Competitive Strategy, Marketing Innovation\nCore electives (select one)\nManagerial Finance, Intro to Operations Management, Competitive Strategy, Marketing Innovation\n[GRID_TABLE]\nRequired core courses\nLeadership Challenges for an Inclusive World, Economic Analysis for Business Decisions, Data Models and Decisions, Communication for Leaders, Organizational Processes, Financial Accounting\n[GRID_TABLE]\nCore electives (select one)\nManagerial Finance, Intro to Operations Management, Competitive Strategy, Marketing Innovation\n[GRID_TABLE]\nBusiness Analytics Certificate\nAnalytics Certificate\nPM Certificate\nProduct Management Certificate\nEM Certificate\nEnterprise Management Certificate\nTrust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship\nEntrepreneurship & Innovation Certificate\nFinance\nFinance Certificate\nMIT Sloan Health Systems Initiative\nHealthcare Certificate\nMIT Sloan Sustainability Initiative\nSustainability Certificate",
