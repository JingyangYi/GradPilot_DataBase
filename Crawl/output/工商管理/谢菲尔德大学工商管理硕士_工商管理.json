The aim of the module is to equip non-financial students with an appropriate level of financial competence - and confidence - and hence view accounting and financial management from the perspective of general management: that is, as users of financial information. This means that learning does not take the form of a series of textbook technical exercises, but grasps concepts and applies them to the real world, as demonstrated on the case company. The accounting element of the module is concerned primarily with the usefulness and limitations of accounting and market data in published financial statements, governance and internal reports and controls, business planning, operational decisions, pricing decisions, and performance management. The financial management element of the module examines the role of accounting and market data to support financing decisions, investing decisions and cash and working capital management.\n10 credits\n\n\nManaging Organisational Behaviour\n\n\nThis unit aims to provide students with an understanding of a systematic set of behavioural science concepts for analysing human behaviour in organisations.  The major theories and research findings in this area derive from the academic disciplines of psychology, sociology and anthropology and students will be expected to familiarise themselves as directed.  Further, the unit provides the opportunity to relate these theoretical concepts to realistic organisational problems and to consider appropriate managerial responses.  In this way, the unit is designed not only to increase the ability to analyse behaviour but also to develop the skill to draw on appropriate concepts to influence and manage others effectively in organisational contexts.\n10 credits\n\n\nOperations Management\n\n\nThis module is concerned with the effective and efficient marshalling of the organisation's resources to meet its objectives. An understanding of fundamental concepts and techniques will be provided and used by students to tackle cases which apply to manufacturing and service industries in both private and public sectors. The systematic and logical approach of Operational Research to the solution of management problems is also introduced.\n10 credits\n\n\nGlobal Managerial Economics\n\n\nThis module focuses on the analysis of factors that affect strategic decisions and performance of firms from an economic perspective. This includes organisation-level factors and issues such as the contractual relationships among the different stakeholders of firms and optimal boundaries of firms, as well as the structure and contestability of markets within which they operate. There is particular emphasis on strategic interactions with competitors, designing of contracts in an environment of imperfect (asymmetric) information, and the role of transactions cost in influencing key strategic decisions  involving both domestic and international operations of firms. Finally, there is discussion about the factors that influence the regulatory and macroeconomic contexts in which firms operate, including the relevance of interconnectedness of economies for domestic macroeconomic and regulatory environments. As such, the aim of the module is to provide a coherent picture of application of economic principles to different aspects of managerial decision making.\n10 credits\n\n\nThe Intelligent Organisation\n\n\nAn intelligent organisation strategically harnesses data and disruptive technologies to achieve its overarching objectives. The insights generated from extensive internal and external data pools empower organisations to operate with enhanced effectiveness and efficiency. For example, Big Data Analytics helps organisations to identify new opportunities and predict future scenarios. Simultaneously, disruptive technologies like Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things further strengthen data-driven organisations by automating underlying business processes. This module therefore focuses on how data and disruptive technologies enable organisations to achieve high levels of digital transformation. It also provides insights into how to assess the readiness for digital transformation and the challenges of delivering digital transformation projects. This module uses interactive lectures, hands-on sessions, guest lectures from industry experts, and case studies to introduce core concepts and their uses in the real world.\n10 credits\n\n\nMarketing Consultancy Challenge\n\n\nThis module integrates consulting with marketing through application on a real company project. You will become familiar with the marketing process, the practice and critical importance of marketing as well as important managerial decisions including those about the choice of the target market, the nature of the offerings and marketing strategies that are aimed at communicating and delivering values. While marketing will provide a set of principles and context, consultancy will provide students with an opportunity to apply theoretically grounded consulting principles into a client based marketing problem. The rationale is that many business consulting projects are driven by the initial need for improvement in markets, products and channels to customers, branding, the design of associated processes etc.\n20 credits\n\n\nPersonal, Professional and Career Development\n\n\nThe Personal, Professional and Career Development (PPCD) module is an integral element in the MBA journey, which runs throughout your MBA programme. It is designed to help you cultivate your self awareness and develop the skills needed to achieve your personal, professional and career development goals. This involves personal development and career planning, and setting objectives and identifying strategies to achieve them. The personal element will encompass, for example, self-awareness, self-care, wellbeing, and defining what success means. The professional element is concerned with development activities linked to professionalism and leadership skills development. The career element of this module involves supporting you in achieving your career aspirations which might extend beyond one particular employer or entrepreneurial venture.  These skills include, for example, networking, team working, negotiation, interview skills, etc. The delivery of this module will be through a wide range of in-class learning, interactive sessions led by experts, industry visits and extra-curricular activities.\n5 credits\nCore modules:\nAs managers in businesses, social enterprises or governmental organisations, an ability to interpret accounting reports and exercise financial judgment is essential.

The Personal, Professional and Career Development module will continue to elevate your capabilities, equipping you with the tools and insights to excel as you return to the workplace and make a lasting impact on your career.\nCore modules:\n\n\nNew Venture Creation Challenge\n\n\nThis is a project-based module in which, working in small groups, you will research and develop a business plan for a new venture. With facilitation and coaching, you will select an entrepreneurial idea and develop it into a comprehensive and fully detailed written business plan. All aspects of the business must be thoroughly researched and the written plan must include five years of financial projections. The module also considers what it takes to become more entrepreneurial or 'intrapreneurial', by critically considering to what extent it is possible to replicate entrepreneurial DNA. The module considers the importance of organisational leadership, structure, systems, strategies and cultures. The overarching aim is to enable you to assess entrepreneurial orientation and its potential both in theory and practice.\n10 credits\n\n\nStrategic Management\n\n\nThis module examines what we mean by organisational strategy and how strategy is realised in organisations. Strategy can be conceived as the direction and scope of an organisation over the long term and also as an organizational activity and set of practices to do with, for example, strategic analysis and strategic planning as well as processes of negotiation and persuasion. Strategic management entails making distinctive choices that are consequential for the long-term direction, scope and survival of an organisation - often in a turbulent environment, with rapid economic, regulatory, technological, ecological and social changes. Furthermore, strategy formation, implementation, and change involve not just top management, but a variety of organizational members and external stakeholders. On this module you will engage with this complexity through a set of lectures, class discussion and debate, case analysis, and reflection on your experience, with the aim of developing your ability to critically deploy key theories and frameworks to diagnose strategic issues and make informed strategic decisions.\n10 credits\n\n\nEffective and Responsible Leadership\n\n\nThe need for effective and responsible leadership has never been greater, with the ethics and sustainability of organisational practices becoming increasingly scrutinised. Consequently, leading ethically and responsibly is crucial for the financial and socio-ecological sustainability of organisations. This module will explore perspectives on leadership to consider the meanings and practices of leading effectively and responsibly in different contexts. By undertaking a range of classroom activities and developing a reflective portfolio, you will learn to critically reflect on your and others' leadership and followership in order to develop your abilities.\n10 credits\n\n\nInternationalisation Challenge\n\n\nThis module focuses on international business opportunities and the processes, strategies and theories that entrepreneurs, and managers need to follow and apply to pursue them. The primary disciplines for this module are international business, strategy and entrepreneurship which are brought together around the idea that to pursue international opportunities, the firm needs to internationalise, and understand how to do so strategically and effectively. The aim of this module is to enable students to understand and integrate theory and apply it to interpretation and analysis in very specific firm and country contexts, to generate theoretical understanding and practical outcomes for a specified firm.\n10 credits\n\n\nIndividual MBA Challenge\n\n\nThis is an individual project taken towards the end of the Sheffield MBA programme and allows the student to demonstrate the ability to research a management issue within an academic framework and within the context of a specific organisation or industry. It utilises knowledge and skills acquired in the earlier part of the programme, and is executed under the general guidance of a supervisor. The module will also equip students with the frameworks and approaches needed while researching in the field of Management. A dissertation written by the student should be delivered to the School at the conclusion.\n45 credits\n\n\nPersonal, Professional and Career Development\n\n\nThe Personal, Professional and Career Development (PPCD) module is an integral element in the MBA journey, which runs throughout your MBA programme.

The concept of strategic management accounting is relevant for both private and public sector organisations.\n10 credits\n\n\nCorporate Finance\n\n\nThis module examines how corporate decision-makers determine policies on funding and firm investment choices. It assesses both areas by scrutinizing background theory and real applications.

The aim of the module is to equip non-financial students with an appropriate level of financial competence - and confidence - and hence view accounting and financial management from the perspective of general management: that is, as users of financial information. This means that learning does not take the form of a series of textbook technical exercises, but grasps concepts and applies them to the real world, as demonstrated on the case company. The accounting element of the module is concerned primarily with the usefulness and limitations of accounting and market data in published financial statements, governance and internal reports and controls, business planning, operational decisions, pricing decisions, and performance management. The financial management element of the module examines the role of accounting and market data to support financing decisions, investing decisions and cash and working capital management.\n10 credits\n\n\nManaging Organisational Behaviour\n\n\nThis unit aims to provide students with an understanding of a systematic set of behavioural science concepts for analysing human behaviour in organisations.  The major theories and research findings in this area derive from the academic disciplines of psychology, sociology and anthropology and students will be expected to familiarise themselves as directed.  Further, the unit provides the opportunity to relate these theoretical concepts to realistic organisational problems and to consider appropriate managerial responses.  In this way, the unit is designed not only to increase the ability to analyse behaviour but also to develop the skill to draw on appropriate concepts to influence and manage others effectively in organisational contexts.\n10 credits\n\n\nOperations Management\n\n\nThis module is concerned with the effective and efficient marshalling of the organisation's resources to meet its objectives. An understanding of fundamental concepts and techniques will be provided and used by students to tackle cases which apply to manufacturing and service industries in both private and public sectors. The systematic and logical approach of Operational Research to the solution of management problems is also introduced.\n10 credits\n\n\nGlobal Managerial Economics\n\n\nThis module focuses on the analysis of factors that affect strategic decisions and performance of firms from an economic perspective. This includes organisation-level factors and issues such as the contractual relationships among the different stakeholders of firms and optimal boundaries of firms, as well as the structure and contestability of markets within which they operate. There is particular emphasis on strategic interactions with competitors, designing of contracts in an environment of imperfect (asymmetric) information, and the role of transactions cost in influencing key strategic decisions  involving both domestic and international operations of firms. Finally, there is discussion about the factors that influence the regulatory and macroeconomic contexts in which firms operate, including the relevance of interconnectedness of economies for domestic macroeconomic and regulatory environments. As such, the aim of the module is to provide a coherent picture of application of economic principles to different aspects of managerial decision making.\n10 credits\n\n\nThe Intelligent Organisation\n\n\nAn intelligent organisation strategically harnesses data and disruptive technologies to achieve its overarching objectives. The insights generated from extensive internal and external data pools empower organisations to operate with enhanced effectiveness and efficiency. For example, Big Data Analytics helps organisations to identify new opportunities and predict future scenarios. Simultaneously, disruptive technologies like Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things further strengthen data-driven organisations by automating underlying business processes. This module therefore focuses on how data and disruptive technologies enable organisations to achieve high levels of digital transformation. It also provides insights into how to assess the readiness for digital transformation and the challenges of delivering digital transformation projects. This module uses interactive lectures, hands-on sessions, guest lectures from industry experts, and case studies to introduce core concepts and their uses in the real world.\n10 credits\n\n\nMarketing Consultancy Challenge\n\n\nThis module integrates consulting with marketing through application on a real company project. You will become familiar with the marketing process, the practice and critical importance of marketing as well as important managerial decisions including those about the choice of the target market, the nature of the offerings and marketing strategies that are aimed at communicating and delivering values. While marketing will provide a set of principles and context, consultancy will provide students with an opportunity to apply theoretically grounded consulting principles into a client based marketing problem. The rationale is that many business consulting projects are driven by the initial need for improvement in markets, products and channels to customers, branding, the design of associated processes etc.\n20 credits\n\n\nPersonal, Professional and Career Development\n\n\nThe Personal, Professional and Career Development (PPCD) module is an integral element in the MBA journey, which runs throughout your MBA programme. It is designed to help you cultivate your self awareness and develop the skills needed to achieve your personal, professional and career development goals. This involves personal development and career planning, and setting objectives and identifying strategies to achieve them. The personal element will encompass, for example, self-awareness, self-care, wellbeing, and defining what success means. The professional element is concerned with development activities linked to professionalism and leadership skills development. The career element of this module involves supporting you in achieving your career aspirations which might extend beyond one particular employer or entrepreneurial venture.  These skills include, for example, networking, team working, negotiation, interview skills, etc. The delivery of this module will be through a wide range of in-class learning, interactive sessions led by experts, industry visits and extra-curricular activities.\n5 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelop your consultancy skills on the AGCAS award nominated Internationalisation Challenge module, as well as the Individual MBA Challenge, collaborating with local clients to drive global impact. Continue developing your understanding of a variety of business functions, tailoring the programme to your interests as you select elective modules. The Personal, Professional and Career Development module will continue to elevate your capabilities, equipping you with the tools and insights to excel as you return to the workplace and make a lasting impact on your career.\n\n\n\n Core modules:\n\n\nNew Venture Creation Challenge\n\n\nThis is a project-based module in which, working in small groups, you will research and develop a business plan for a new venture. With facilitation and coaching, you will select an entrepreneurial idea and develop it into a comprehensive and fully detailed written business plan. All aspects of the business must be thoroughly researched and the written plan must include five years of financial projections. The module also considers what it takes to become more entrepreneurial or 'intrapreneurial', by critically considering to what extent it is possible to replicate entrepreneurial DNA. The module considers the importance of organisational leadership, structure, systems, strategies and cultures. The overarching aim is to enable you to assess entrepreneurial orientation and its potential both in theory and practice.\n10 credits\n\n\nStrategic Management\n\n\nThis module examines what we mean by organisational strategy and how strategy is realised in organisations. Strategy can be conceived as the direction and scope of an organisation over the long term and also as an organizational activity and set of practices to do with, for example, strategic analysis and strategic planning as well as processes of negotiation and persuasion. Strategic management entails making distinctive choices that are consequential for the long-term direction, scope and survival of an organisation - often in a turbulent environment, with rapid economic, regulatory, technological, ecological and social changes. Furthermore, strategy formation, implementation, and change involve not just top management, but a variety of organizational members and external stakeholders. On this module you will engage with this complexity through a set of lectures, class discussion and debate, case analysis, and reflection on your experience, with the aim of developing your ability to critically deploy key theories and frameworks to diagnose strategic issues and make informed strategic decisions.\n10 credits\n\n\nEffective and Responsible Leadership\n\n\nThe need for effective and responsible leadership has never been greater, with the ethics and sustainability of organisational practices becoming increasingly scrutinised. Consequently, leading ethically and responsibly is crucial for the financial and socio-ecological sustainability of organisations. This module will explore perspectives on leadership to consider the meanings and practices of leading effectively and responsibly in different contexts. By undertaking a range of classroom activities and developing a reflective portfolio, you will learn to critically reflect on your and others' leadership and followership in order to develop your abilities.\n10 credits\n\n\nInternationalisation Challenge\n\n\nThis module focuses on international business opportunities and the processes, strategies and theories that entrepreneurs, and managers need to follow and apply to pursue them. The primary disciplines for this module are international business, strategy and entrepreneurship which are brought together around the idea that to pursue international opportunities, the firm needs to internationalise, and understand how to do so strategically and effectively. The aim of this module is to enable students to understand and integrate theory and apply it to interpretation and analysis in very specific firm and country contexts, to generate theoretical understanding and practical outcomes for a specified firm.\n10 credits\n\n\nIndividual MBA Challenge\n\n\nThis is an individual project taken towards the end of the Sheffield MBA programme and allows the student to demonstrate the ability to research a management issue within an academic framework and within the context of a specific organisation or industry. It utilises knowledge and skills acquired in the earlier part of the programme, and is executed under the general guidance of a supervisor. The module will also equip students with the frameworks and approaches needed while researching in the field of Management. A dissertation written by the student should be delivered to the School at the conclusion.\n45 credits\n\n\nPersonal, Professional and Career Development\n\n\nThe Personal, Professional and Career Development (PPCD) module is an integral element in the MBA journey, which runs throughout your MBA programme. It is designed to help you cultivate your self awareness and develop the skills needed to achieve your personal, professional and career development goals. This involves personal development and career planning, and setting objectives and identifying strategies to achieve them. The personal element will encompass, for example, self-awareness, self-care, wellbeing, and defining what success means. The professional element is concerned with development activities linked to professionalism and leadership skills development. The career element of this module involves supporting you in achieving your career aspirations which might extend beyond one particular employer or entrepreneurial venture.  These skills include, for example, networking, team working, negotiation, interview skills, etc. The delivery of this module will be through a wide range of in-class learning, interactive sessions led by experts, industry visits and extra-curricular activities.\n5 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n You will select 2 of the 4 elective modules:\n\n\nHuman Resource Management\n\n\nThis module has three objectives.  It is intended to develop an understanding of the international and comparative factors (such as national culture) that shape human resource management.  It will also build functional knowledge of the main tools and techniques used in the HRM field.  Finally, it will develop an awareness of some of the most pertinent HRM issues in Europe, the Far East and America.  Teaching methods for the option will combine the project method, formal lectures, videos, case study analysis, analysis of example HRM tools and techniques and Powerpoint presentations.\n10 credits\n\n\nStrategic Management Accounting\n\n\nThis module explores the way in which management accounting information can play an important role in the strategic development of organisations. It recognises the need for management accounting to be more externally focussed and for it to provide information that helps organisations face up to strategic uncertainties. The concept of strategic management accounting is relevant for both private and public sector organisations.\n10 credits\n\n\nCorporate Finance\n\n\nThis module examines how corporate decision-makers determine policies on funding and firm investment choices. It assesses both areas by scrutinizing background theory and real applications. The module addresses some of the pivotal areas of concern for financial decision-makers, including the formulation of recommendations and policies on investment appraisal, corporate leverage, dividend policy, stock buy-backs, risk management, and CSR-engagement. The module will address such issues within the context of perfect (frictionless) and imperfect market settings and will also stress the role of external capital markets (debt and equity) in relation to the growth cycle of a listed firm.\n10 credits\n\n\nOrganisational Crisis Management\n\n\nCrisis management is an emerging area of management research and practice reflecting the growing scope and scale for organisational disruptions. This module adopts a processual and broad systems perspective to understanding how crises can emerge in organisations and how best managers might prepare for, mitigate and manage these. This is an integrative module which draws upon multi-disciplinary perspectives to provide learners with conceptual insights and analytical tools needed to be effective managers. The teaching strategy is underpinned by case studies developed by the module leader and others. This approach allows students to enhance their critical and analytical skills by evaluating real world management practice and developing their own crisis management abilities through formulating appropriate strategic and operational responses.\n10 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content of our courses is reviewed annually to make sure it's up-to-date and relevant.

You will apply teachings from the Professional, Personal and Career Development module to build real relationships and expand your professional network, laying the foundations for success as you embark on your MBA journey. \n\n\n\n Core modules:\n\n\nAccounting and Financial Management\n\n\nAs managers in businesses, social enterprises or governmental organisations, an ability to interpret accounting reports and exercise financial judgment is essential. The aim of the module is to equip non-financial students with an appropriate level of financial competence - and confidence - and hence view accounting and financial management from the perspective of general management: that is, as users of financial information. This means that learning does not take the form of a series of textbook technical exercises, but grasps concepts and applies them to the real world, as demonstrated on the case company. The accounting element of the module is concerned primarily with the usefulness and limitations of accounting and market data in published financial statements, governance and internal reports and controls, business planning, operational decisions, pricing decisions, and performance management. The financial management element of the module examines the role of accounting and market data to support financing decisions, investing decisions and cash and working capital management.\n10 credits\n\n\nManaging Organisational Behaviour\n\n\nThis unit aims to provide students with an understanding of a systematic set of behavioural science concepts for analysing human behaviour in organisations.  The major theories and research findings in this area derive from the academic disciplines of psychology, sociology and anthropology and students will be expected to familiarise themselves as directed.  Further, the unit provides the opportunity to relate these theoretical concepts to realistic organisational problems and to consider appropriate managerial responses.  In this way, the unit is designed not only to increase the ability to analyse behaviour but also to develop the skill to draw on appropriate concepts to influence and manage others effectively in organisational contexts.\n10 credits\n\n\nOperations Management\n\n\nThis module is concerned with the effective and efficient marshalling of the organisation's resources to meet its objectives. An understanding of fundamental concepts and techniques will be provided and used by students to tackle cases which apply to manufacturing and service industries in both private and public sectors. The systematic and logical approach of Operational Research to the solution of management problems is also introduced.\n10 credits\n\n\nGlobal Managerial Economics\n\n\nThis module focuses on the analysis of factors that affect strategic decisions and performance of firms from an economic perspective. This includes organisation-level factors and issues such as the contractual relationships among the different stakeholders of firms and optimal boundaries of firms, as well as the structure and contestability of markets within which they operate. There is particular emphasis on strategic interactions with competitors, designing of contracts in an environment of imperfect (asymmetric) information, and the role of transactions cost in influencing key strategic decisions  involving both domestic and international operations of firms. Finally, there is discussion about the factors that influence the regulatory and macroeconomic contexts in which firms operate, including the relevance of interconnectedness of economies for domestic macroeconomic and regulatory environments. As such, the aim of the module is to provide a coherent picture of application of economic principles to different aspects of managerial decision making.\n10 credits\n\n\nThe Intelligent Organisation\n\n\nAn intelligent organisation strategically harnesses data and disruptive technologies to achieve its overarching objectives. The insights generated from extensive internal and external data pools empower organisations to operate with enhanced effectiveness and efficiency. For example, Big Data Analytics helps organisations to identify new opportunities and predict future scenarios. Simultaneously, disruptive technologies like Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things further strengthen data-driven organisations by automating underlying business processes. This module therefore focuses on how data and disruptive technologies enable organisations to achieve high levels of digital transformation. It also provides insights into how to assess the readiness for digital transformation and the challenges of delivering digital transformation projects. This module uses interactive lectures, hands-on sessions, guest lectures from industry experts, and case studies to introduce core concepts and their uses in the real world.\n10 credits\n\n\nMarketing Consultancy Challenge\n\n\nThis module integrates consulting with marketing through application on a real company project. You will become familiar with the marketing process, the practice and critical importance of marketing as well as important managerial decisions including those about the choice of the target market, the nature of the offerings and marketing strategies that are aimed at communicating and delivering values. While marketing will provide a set of principles and context, consultancy will provide students with an opportunity to apply theoretically grounded consulting principles into a client based marketing problem. The rationale is that many business consulting projects are driven by the initial need for improvement in markets, products and channels to customers, branding, the design of associated processes etc.\n20 credits\n\n\nPersonal, Professional and Career Development\n\n\nThe Personal, Professional and Career Development (PPCD) module is an integral element in the MBA journey, which runs throughout your MBA programme. It is designed to help you cultivate your self awareness and develop the skills needed to achieve your personal, professional and career development goals. This involves personal development and career planning, and setting objectives and identifying strategies to achieve them. The personal element will encompass, for example, self-awareness, self-care, wellbeing, and defining what success means. The professional element is concerned with development activities linked to professionalism and leadership skills development. The career element of this module involves supporting you in achieving your career aspirations which might extend beyond one particular employer or entrepreneurial venture.  These skills include, for example, networking, team working, negotiation, interview skills, etc. The delivery of this module will be through a wide range of in-class learning, interactive sessions led by experts, industry visits and extra-curricular activities.\n5 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelop your consultancy skills on the AGCAS award nominated Internationalisation Challenge module, as well as the Individual MBA Challenge, collaborating with local clients to drive global impact. Continue developing your understanding of a variety of business functions, tailoring the programme to your interests as you select elective modules. The Personal, Professional and Career Development module will continue to elevate your capabilities, equipping you with the tools and insights to excel as you return to the workplace and make a lasting impact on your career.\n\n\n\n Core modules:\n\n\nNew Venture Creation Challenge\n\n\nThis is a project-based module in which, working in small groups, you will research and develop a business plan for a new venture. With facilitation and coaching, you will select an entrepreneurial idea and develop it into a comprehensive and fully detailed written business plan. All aspects of the business must be thoroughly researched and the written plan must include five years of financial projections. The module also considers what it takes to become more entrepreneurial or 'intrapreneurial', by critically considering to what extent it is possible to replicate entrepreneurial DNA. The module considers the importance of organisational leadership, structure, systems, strategies and cultures. The overarching aim is to enable you to assess entrepreneurial orientation and its potential both in theory and practice.\n10 credits\n\n\nStrategic Management\n\n\nThis module examines what we mean by organisational strategy and how strategy is realised in organisations. Strategy can be conceived as the direction and scope of an organisation over the long term and also as an organizational activity and set of practices to do with, for example, strategic analysis and strategic planning as well as processes of negotiation and persuasion. Strategic management entails making distinctive choices that are consequential for the long-term direction, scope and survival of an organisation - often in a turbulent environment, with rapid economic, regulatory, technological, ecological and social changes. Furthermore, strategy formation, implementation, and change involve not just top management, but a variety of organizational members and external stakeholders. On this module you will engage with this complexity through a set of lectures, class discussion and debate, case analysis, and reflection on your experience, with the aim of developing your ability to critically deploy key theories and frameworks to diagnose strategic issues and make informed strategic decisions.\n10 credits\n\n\nEffective and Responsible Leadership\n\n\nThe need for effective and responsible leadership has never been greater, with the ethics and sustainability of organisational practices becoming increasingly scrutinised. Consequently, leading ethically and responsibly is crucial for the financial and socio-ecological sustainability of organisations. This module will explore perspectives on leadership to consider the meanings and practices of leading effectively and responsibly in different contexts. By undertaking a range of classroom activities and developing a reflective portfolio, you will learn to critically reflect on your and others' leadership and followership in order to develop your abilities.\n10 credits\n\n\nInternationalisation Challenge\n\n\nThis module focuses on international business opportunities and the processes, strategies and theories that entrepreneurs, and managers need to follow and apply to pursue them. The primary disciplines for this module are international business, strategy and entrepreneurship which are brought together around the idea that to pursue international opportunities, the firm needs to internationalise, and understand how to do so strategically and effectively. The aim of this module is to enable students to understand and integrate theory and apply it to interpretation and analysis in very specific firm and country contexts, to generate theoretical understanding and practical outcomes for a specified firm.\n10 credits\n\n\nIndividual MBA Challenge\n\n\nThis is an individual project taken towards the end of the Sheffield MBA programme and allows the student to demonstrate the ability to research a management issue within an academic framework and within the context of a specific organisation or industry. It utilises knowledge and skills acquired in the earlier part of the programme, and is executed under the general guidance of a supervisor. The module will also equip students with the frameworks and approaches needed while researching in the field of Management. A dissertation written by the student should be delivered to the School at the conclusion.\n45 credits\n\n\nPersonal, Professional and Career Development\n\n\nThe Personal, Professional and Career Development (PPCD) module is an integral element in the MBA journey, which runs throughout your MBA programme. It is designed to help you cultivate your self awareness and develop the skills needed to achieve your personal, professional and career development goals. This involves personal development and career planning, and setting objectives and identifying strategies to achieve them. The personal element will encompass, for example, self-awareness, self-care, wellbeing, and defining what success means. The professional element is concerned with development activities linked to professionalism and leadership skills development. The career element of this module involves supporting you in achieving your career aspirations which might extend beyond one particular employer or entrepreneurial venture.  These skills include, for example, networking, team working, negotiation, interview skills, etc. The delivery of this module will be through a wide range of in-class learning, interactive sessions led by experts, industry visits and extra-curricular activities.\n5 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n You will select 2 of the 4 elective modules:\n\n\nHuman Resource Management\n\n\nThis module has three objectives.  It is intended to develop an understanding of the international and comparative factors (such as national culture) that shape human resource management.  It will also build functional knowledge of the main tools and techniques used in the HRM field.  Finally, it will develop an awareness of some of the most pertinent HRM issues in Europe, the Far East and America.  Teaching methods for the option will combine the project method, formal lectures, videos, case study analysis, analysis of example HRM tools and techniques and Powerpoint presentations.\n10 credits\n\n\nStrategic Management Accounting\n\n\nThis module explores the way in which management accounting information can play an important role in the strategic development of organisations. It recognises the need for management accounting to be more externally focussed and for it to provide information that helps organisations face up to strategic uncertainties. The concept of strategic management accounting is relevant for both private and public sector organisations.\n10 credits\n\n\nCorporate Finance\n\n\nThis module examines how corporate decision-makers determine policies on funding and firm investment choices. It assesses both areas by scrutinizing background theory and real applications. The module addresses some of the pivotal areas of concern for financial decision-makers, including the formulation of recommendations and policies on investment appraisal, corporate leverage, dividend policy, stock buy-backs, risk management, and CSR-engagement. The module will address such issues within the context of perfect (frictionless) and imperfect market settings and will also stress the role of external capital markets (debt and equity) in relation to the growth cycle of a listed firm.\n10 credits\n\n\nOrganisational Crisis Management\n\n\nCrisis management is an emerging area of management research and practice reflecting the growing scope and scale for organisational disruptions. This module adopts a processual and broad systems perspective to understanding how crises can emerge in organisations and how best managers might prepare for, mitigate and manage these. This is an integrative module which draws upon multi-disciplinary perspectives to provide learners with conceptual insights and analytical tools needed to be effective managers. The teaching strategy is underpinned by case studies developed by the module leader and others. This approach allows students to enhance their critical and analytical skills by evaluating real world management practice and developing their own crisis management abilities through formulating appropriate strategic and operational responses.\n10 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content of our courses is reviewed annually to make sure it's up-to-date and relevant.

This means that learning does not take the form of a series of textbook technical exercises, but grasps concepts and applies them to the real world, as demonstrated on the case company. The accounting element of the module is concerned primarily with the usefulness and limitations of accounting and market data in published financial statements, governance and internal reports and controls, business planning, operational decisions, pricing decisions, and performance management. The financial management element of the module examines the role of accounting and market data to support financing decisions, investing decisions and cash and working capital management.\n10 credits\n\n\nManaging Organisational Behaviour\n\n\nThis unit aims to provide students with an understanding of a systematic set of behavioural science concepts for analysing human behaviour in organisations.  The major theories and research findings in this area derive from the academic disciplines of psychology, sociology and anthropology and students will be expected to familiarise themselves as directed.  Further, the unit provides the opportunity to relate these theoretical concepts to realistic organisational problems and to consider appropriate managerial responses.  In this way, the unit is designed not only to increase the ability to analyse behaviour but also to develop the skill to draw on appropriate concepts to influence and manage others effectively in organisational contexts.\n10 credits\n\n\nOperations Management\n\n\nThis module is concerned with the effective and efficient marshalling of the organisation's resources to meet its objectives. An understanding of fundamental concepts and techniques will be provided and used by students to tackle cases which apply to manufacturing and service industries in both private and public sectors. The systematic and logical approach of Operational Research to the solution of management problems is also introduced.\n10 credits\n\n\nGlobal Managerial Economics\n\n\nThis module focuses on the analysis of factors that affect strategic decisions and performance of firms from an economic perspective. This includes organisation-level factors and issues such as the contractual relationships among the different stakeholders of firms and optimal boundaries of firms, as well as the structure and contestability of markets within which they operate. There is particular emphasis on strategic interactions with competitors, designing of contracts in an environment of imperfect (asymmetric) information, and the role of transactions cost in influencing key strategic decisions  involving both domestic and international operations of firms. Finally, there is discussion about the factors that influence the regulatory and macroeconomic contexts in which firms operate, including the relevance of interconnectedness of economies for domestic macroeconomic and regulatory environments. As such, the aim of the module is to provide a coherent picture of application of economic principles to different aspects of managerial decision making.\n10 credits\n\n\nThe Intelligent Organisation\n\n\nAn intelligent organisation strategically harnesses data and disruptive technologies to achieve its overarching objectives. The insights generated from extensive internal and external data pools empower organisations to operate with enhanced effectiveness and efficiency. For example, Big Data Analytics helps organisations to identify new opportunities and predict future scenarios. Simultaneously, disruptive technologies like Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things further strengthen data-driven organisations by automating underlying business processes. This module therefore focuses on how data and disruptive technologies enable organisations to achieve high levels of digital transformation. It also provides insights into how to assess the readiness for digital transformation and the challenges of delivering digital transformation projects. This module uses interactive lectures, hands-on sessions, guest lectures from industry experts, and case studies to introduce core concepts and their uses in the real world.\n10 credits\n\n\nMarketing Consultancy Challenge\n\n\nThis module integrates consulting with marketing through application on a real company project. You will become familiar with the marketing process, the practice and critical importance of marketing as well as important managerial decisions including those about the choice of the target market, the nature of the offerings and marketing strategies that are aimed at communicating and delivering values. While marketing will provide a set of principles and context, consultancy will provide students with an opportunity to apply theoretically grounded consulting principles into a client based marketing problem. The rationale is that many business consulting projects are driven by the initial need for improvement in markets, products and channels to customers, branding, the design of associated processes etc.\n20 credits\n\n\nPersonal, Professional and Career Development\n\n\nThe Personal, Professional and Career Development (PPCD) module is an integral element in the MBA journey, which runs throughout your MBA programme. It is designed to help you cultivate your self awareness and develop the skills needed to achieve your personal, professional and career development goals. This involves personal development and career planning, and setting objectives and identifying strategies to achieve them. The personal element will encompass, for example, self-awareness, self-care, wellbeing, and defining what success means. The professional element is concerned with development activities linked to professionalism and leadership skills development. The career element of this module involves supporting you in achieving your career aspirations which might extend beyond one particular employer or entrepreneurial venture.  These skills include, for example, networking, team working, negotiation, interview skills, etc. The delivery of this module will be through a wide range of in-class learning, interactive sessions led by experts, industry visits and extra-curricular activities.\n5 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelop your consultancy skills on the AGCAS award nominated Internationalisation Challenge module, as well as the Individual MBA Challenge, collaborating with local clients to drive global impact. Continue developing your understanding of a variety of business functions, tailoring the programme to your interests as you select elective modules. The Personal, Professional and Career Development module will continue to elevate your capabilities, equipping you with the tools and insights to excel as you return to the workplace and make a lasting impact on your career.\n\n\n\n Core modules:\n\n\nNew Venture Creation Challenge\n\n\nThis is a project-based module in which, working in small groups, you will research and develop a business plan for a new venture. With facilitation and coaching, you will select an entrepreneurial idea and develop it into a comprehensive and fully detailed written business plan. All aspects of the business must be thoroughly researched and the written plan must include five years of financial projections. The module also considers what it takes to become more entrepreneurial or 'intrapreneurial', by critically considering to what extent it is possible to replicate entrepreneurial DNA. The module considers the importance of organisational leadership, structure, systems, strategies and cultures. The overarching aim is to enable you to assess entrepreneurial orientation and its potential both in theory and practice.\n10 credits\n\n\nStrategic Management\n\n\nThis module examines what we mean by organisational strategy and how strategy is realised in organisations. Strategy can be conceived as the direction and scope of an organisation over the long term and also as an organizational activity and set of practices to do with, for example, strategic analysis and strategic planning as well as processes of negotiation and persuasion. Strategic management entails making distinctive choices that are consequential for the long-term direction, scope and survival of an organisation - often in a turbulent environment, with rapid economic, regulatory, technological, ecological and social changes. Furthermore, strategy formation, implementation, and change involve not just top management, but a variety of organizational members and external stakeholders. On this module you will engage with this complexity through a set of lectures, class discussion and debate, case analysis, and reflection on your experience, with the aim of developing your ability to critically deploy key theories and frameworks to diagnose strategic issues and make informed strategic decisions.\n10 credits\n\n\nEffective and Responsible Leadership\n\n\nThe need for effective and responsible leadership has never been greater, with the ethics and sustainability of organisational practices becoming increasingly scrutinised. Consequently, leading ethically and responsibly is crucial for the financial and socio-ecological sustainability of organisations. This module will explore perspectives on leadership to consider the meanings and practices of leading effectively and responsibly in different contexts. By undertaking a range of classroom activities and developing a reflective portfolio, you will learn to critically reflect on your and others' leadership and followership in order to develop your abilities.\n10 credits\n\n\nInternationalisation Challenge\n\n\nThis module focuses on international business opportunities and the processes, strategies and theories that entrepreneurs, and managers need to follow and apply to pursue them. The primary disciplines for this module are international business, strategy and entrepreneurship which are brought together around the idea that to pursue international opportunities, the firm needs to internationalise, and understand how to do so strategically and effectively. The aim of this module is to enable students to understand and integrate theory and apply it to interpretation and analysis in very specific firm and country contexts, to generate theoretical understanding and practical outcomes for a specified firm.\n10 credits\n\n\nIndividual MBA Challenge\n\n\nThis is an individual project taken towards the end of the Sheffield MBA programme and allows the student to demonstrate the ability to research a management issue within an academic framework and within the context of a specific organisation or industry. It utilises knowledge and skills acquired in the earlier part of the programme, and is executed under the general guidance of a supervisor. The module will also equip students with the frameworks and approaches needed while researching in the field of Management. A dissertation written by the student should be delivered to the School at the conclusion.\n45 credits\n\n\nPersonal, Professional and Career Development\n\n\nThe Personal, Professional and Career Development (PPCD) module is an integral element in the MBA journey, which runs throughout your MBA programme. It is designed to help you cultivate your self awareness and develop the skills needed to achieve your personal, professional and career development goals. This involves personal development and career planning, and setting objectives and identifying strategies to achieve them. The personal element will encompass, for example, self-awareness, self-care, wellbeing, and defining what success means. The professional element is concerned with development activities linked to professionalism and leadership skills development. The career element of this module involves supporting you in achieving your career aspirations which might extend beyond one particular employer or entrepreneurial venture.  These skills include, for example, networking, team working, negotiation, interview skills, etc. The delivery of this module will be through a wide range of in-class learning, interactive sessions led by experts, industry visits and extra-curricular activities.\n5 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n You will select 2 of the 4 elective modules:\n\n\nHuman Resource Management\n\n\nThis module has three objectives.  It is intended to develop an understanding of the international and comparative factors (such as national culture) that shape human resource management.  It will also build functional knowledge of the main tools and techniques used in the HRM field.  Finally, it will develop an awareness of some of the most pertinent HRM issues in Europe, the Far East and America.  Teaching methods for the option will combine the project method, formal lectures, videos, case study analysis, analysis of example HRM tools and techniques and Powerpoint presentations.\n10 credits\n\n\nStrategic Management Accounting\n\n\nThis module explores the way in which management accounting information can play an important role in the strategic development of organisations. It recognises the need for management accounting to be more externally focussed and for it to provide information that helps organisations face up to strategic uncertainties. The concept of strategic management accounting is relevant for both private and public sector organisations.\n10 credits\n\n\nCorporate Finance\n\n\nThis module examines how corporate decision-makers determine policies on funding and firm investment choices. It assesses both areas by scrutinizing background theory and real applications. The module addresses some of the pivotal areas of concern for financial decision-makers, including the formulation of recommendations and policies on investment appraisal, corporate leverage, dividend policy, stock buy-backs, risk management, and CSR-engagement. The module will address such issues within the context of perfect (frictionless) and imperfect market settings and will also stress the role of external capital markets (debt and equity) in relation to the growth cycle of a listed firm.\n10 credits\n\n\nOrganisational Crisis Management\n\n\nCrisis management is an emerging area of management research and practice reflecting the growing scope and scale for organisational disruptions. This module adopts a processual and broad systems perspective to understanding how crises can emerge in organisations and how best managers might prepare for, mitigate and manage these. This is an integrative module which draws upon multi-disciplinary perspectives to provide learners with conceptual insights and analytical tools needed to be effective managers. The teaching strategy is underpinned by case studies developed by the module leader and others. This approach allows students to enhance their critical and analytical skills by evaluating real world management practice and developing their own crisis management abilities through formulating appropriate strategic and operational responses.\n10 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content of our courses is reviewed annually to make sure it's up-to-date and relevant.

The module also considers what it takes to become more entrepreneurial or 'intrapreneurial', by critically considering to what extent it is possible to replicate entrepreneurial DNA. The module considers the importance of organisational leadership, structure, systems, strategies and cultures. The overarching aim is to enable you to assess entrepreneurial orientation and its potential both in theory and practice.\n10 credits\n\n\nStrategic Management\n\n\nThis module examines what we mean by organisational strategy and how strategy is realised in organisations. Strategy can be conceived as the direction and scope of an organisation over the long term and also as an organizational activity and set of practices to do with, for example, strategic analysis and strategic planning as well as processes of negotiation and persuasion. Strategic management entails making distinctive choices that are consequential for the long-term direction, scope and survival of an organisation - often in a turbulent environment, with rapid economic, regulatory, technological, ecological and social changes. Furthermore, strategy formation, implementation, and change involve not just top management, but a variety of organizational members and external stakeholders. On this module you will engage with this complexity through a set of lectures, class discussion and debate, case analysis, and reflection on your experience, with the aim of developing your ability to critically deploy key theories and frameworks to diagnose strategic issues and make informed strategic decisions.\n10 credits\n\n\nEffective and Responsible Leadership\n\n\nThe need for effective and responsible leadership has never been greater, with the ethics and sustainability of organisational practices becoming increasingly scrutinised. Consequently, leading ethically and responsibly is crucial for the financial and socio-ecological sustainability of organisations. This module will explore perspectives on leadership to consider the meanings and practices of leading effectively and responsibly in different contexts. By undertaking a range of classroom activities and developing a reflective portfolio, you will learn to critically reflect on your and others' leadership and followership in order to develop your abilities.\n10 credits\n\n\nInternationalisation Challenge\n\n\nThis module focuses on international business opportunities and the processes, strategies and theories that entrepreneurs, and managers need to follow and apply to pursue them. The primary disciplines for this module are international business, strategy and entrepreneurship which are brought together around the idea that to pursue international opportunities, the firm needs to internationalise, and understand how to do so strategically and effectively. The aim of this module is to enable students to understand and integrate theory and apply it to interpretation and analysis in very specific firm and country contexts, to generate theoretical understanding and practical outcomes for a specified firm.\n10 credits\n\n\nIndividual MBA Challenge\n\n\nThis is an individual project taken towards the end of the Sheffield MBA programme and allows the student to demonstrate the ability to research a management issue within an academic framework and within the context of a specific organisation or industry. It utilises knowledge and skills acquired in the earlier part of the programme, and is executed under the general guidance of a supervisor. The module will also equip students with the frameworks and approaches needed while researching in the field of Management. A dissertation written by the student should be delivered to the School at the conclusion.\n45 credits\n\n\nPersonal, Professional and Career Development\n\n\nThe Personal, Professional and Career Development (PPCD) module is an integral element in the MBA journey, which runs throughout your MBA programme. It is designed to help you cultivate your self awareness and develop the skills needed to achieve your personal, professional and career development goals. This involves personal development and career planning, and setting objectives and identifying strategies to achieve them. The personal element will encompass, for example, self-awareness, self-care, wellbeing, and defining what success means. The professional element is concerned with development activities linked to professionalism and leadership skills development. The career element of this module involves supporting you in achieving your career aspirations which might extend beyond one particular employer or entrepreneurial venture.  These skills include, for example, networking, team working, negotiation, interview skills, etc. The delivery of this module will be through a wide range of in-class learning, interactive sessions led by experts, industry visits and extra-curricular activities.\n5 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n You will select 2 of the 4 elective modules:\n\n\nHuman Resource Management\n\n\nThis module has three objectives.  It is intended to develop an understanding of the international and comparative factors (such as national culture) that shape human resource management.  It will also build functional knowledge of the main tools and techniques used in the HRM field.  Finally, it will develop an awareness of some of the most pertinent HRM issues in Europe, the Far East and America.  Teaching methods for the option will combine the project method, formal lectures, videos, case study analysis, analysis of example HRM tools and techniques and Powerpoint presentations.\n10 credits\n\n\nStrategic Management Accounting\n\n\nThis module explores the way in which management accounting information can play an important role in the strategic development of organisations. It recognises the need for management accounting to be more externally focussed and for it to provide information that helps organisations face up to strategic uncertainties. The concept of strategic management accounting is relevant for both private and public sector organisations.\n10 credits\n\n\nCorporate Finance\n\n\nThis module examines how corporate decision-makers determine policies on funding and firm investment choices. It assesses both areas by scrutinizing background theory and real applications. The module addresses some of the pivotal areas of concern for financial decision-makers, including the formulation of recommendations and policies on investment appraisal, corporate leverage, dividend policy, stock buy-backs, risk management, and CSR-engagement. The module will address such issues within the context of perfect (frictionless) and imperfect market settings and will also stress the role of external capital markets (debt and equity) in relation to the growth cycle of a listed firm.\n10 credits\n\n\nOrganisational Crisis Management\n\n\nCrisis management is an emerging area of management research and practice reflecting the growing scope and scale for organisational disruptions. This module adopts a processual and broad systems perspective to understanding how crises can emerge in organisations and how best managers might prepare for, mitigate and manage these. This is an integrative module which draws upon multi-disciplinary perspectives to provide learners with conceptual insights and analytical tools needed to be effective managers. The teaching strategy is underpinned by case studies developed by the module leader and others. This approach allows students to enhance their critical and analytical skills by evaluating real world management practice and developing their own crisis management abilities through formulating appropriate strategic and operational responses.\n10 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content of our courses is reviewed annually to make sure it's up-to-date and relevant.

The aim of the module is to equip non-financial students with an appropriate level of financial competence - and confidence - and hence view accounting and financial management from the perspective of general management: that is, as users of financial information. This means that learning does not take the form of a series of textbook technical exercises, but grasps concepts and applies them to the real world, as demonstrated on the case company. The accounting element of the module is concerned primarily with the usefulness and limitations of accounting and market data in published financial statements, governance and internal reports and controls, business planning, operational decisions, pricing decisions, and performance management. The financial management element of the module examines the role of accounting and market data to support financing decisions, investing decisions and cash and working capital management.\n10 credits\n\n\nManaging Organisational Behaviour\n\n\nThis unit aims to provide students with an understanding of a systematic set of behavioural science concepts for analysing human behaviour in organisations.  The major theories and research findings in this area derive from the academic disciplines of psychology, sociology and anthropology and students will be expected to familiarise themselves as directed.  Further, the unit provides the opportunity to relate these theoretical concepts to realistic organisational problems and to consider appropriate managerial responses.  In this way, the unit is designed not only to increase the ability to analyse behaviour but also to develop the skill to draw on appropriate concepts to influence and manage others effectively in organisational contexts.\n10 credits\n\n\nOperations Management\n\n\nThis module is concerned with the effective and efficient marshalling of the organisation's resources to meet its objectives. An understanding of fundamental concepts and techniques will be provided and used by students to tackle cases which apply to manufacturing and service industries in both private and public sectors. The systematic and logical approach of Operational Research to the solution of management problems is also introduced.\n10 credits\n\n\nGlobal Managerial Economics\n\n\nThis module focuses on the analysis of factors that affect strategic decisions and performance of firms from an economic perspective. This includes organisation-level factors and issues such as the contractual relationships among the different stakeholders of firms and optimal boundaries of firms, as well as the structure and contestability of markets within which they operate. There is particular emphasis on strategic interactions with competitors, designing of contracts in an environment of imperfect (asymmetric) information, and the role of transactions cost in influencing key strategic decisions  involving both domestic and international operations of firms. Finally, there is discussion about the factors that influence the regulatory and macroeconomic contexts in which firms operate, including the relevance of interconnectedness of economies for domestic macroeconomic and regulatory environments. As such, the aim of the module is to provide a coherent picture of application of economic principles to different aspects of managerial decision making.\n10 credits\n\n\nThe Intelligent Organisation\n\n\nAn intelligent organisation strategically harnesses data and disruptive technologies to achieve its overarching objectives. The insights generated from extensive internal and external data pools empower organisations to operate with enhanced effectiveness and efficiency. For example, Big Data Analytics helps organisations to identify new opportunities and predict future scenarios. Simultaneously, disruptive technologies like Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things further strengthen data-driven organisations by automating underlying business processes. This module therefore focuses on how data and disruptive technologies enable organisations to achieve high levels of digital transformation. It also provides insights into how to assess the readiness for digital transformation and the challenges of delivering digital transformation projects. This module uses interactive lectures, hands-on sessions, guest lectures from industry experts, and case studies to introduce core concepts and their uses in the real world.\n10 credits\n\n\nMarketing Consultancy Challenge\n\n\nThis module integrates consulting with marketing through application on a real company project. You will become familiar with the marketing process, the practice and critical importance of marketing as well as important managerial decisions including those about the choice of the target market, the nature of the offerings and marketing strategies that are aimed at communicating and delivering values. While marketing will provide a set of principles and context, consultancy will provide students with an opportunity to apply theoretically grounded consulting principles into a client based marketing problem. The rationale is that many business consulting projects are driven by the initial need for improvement in markets, products and channels to customers, branding, the design of associated processes etc.\n20 credits\n\n\nPersonal, Professional and Career Development\n\n\nThe Personal, Professional and Career Development (PPCD) module is an integral element in the MBA journey, which runs throughout your MBA programme. It is designed to help you cultivate your self awareness and develop the skills needed to achieve your personal, professional and career development goals. This involves personal development and career planning, and setting objectives and identifying strategies to achieve them. The personal element will encompass, for example, self-awareness, self-care, wellbeing, and defining what success means. The professional element is concerned with development activities linked to professionalism and leadership skills development. The career element of this module involves supporting you in achieving your career aspirations which might extend beyond one particular employer or entrepreneurial venture.  These skills include, for example, networking, team working, negotiation, interview skills, etc. The delivery of this module will be through a wide range of in-class learning, interactive sessions led by experts, industry visits and extra-curricular activities.\n5 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelop your consultancy skills on the AGCAS award nominated Internationalisation Challenge module, as well as the Individual MBA Challenge, collaborating with local clients to drive global impact. Continue developing your understanding of a variety of business functions, tailoring the programme to your interests as you select elective modules.

With facilitation and coaching, you will select an entrepreneurial idea and develop it into a comprehensive and fully detailed written business plan. All aspects of the business must be thoroughly researched and the written plan must include five years of financial projections. The module also considers what it takes to become more entrepreneurial or 'intrapreneurial', by critically considering to what extent it is possible to replicate entrepreneurial DNA. The module considers the importance of organisational leadership, structure, systems, strategies and cultures. The overarching aim is to enable you to assess entrepreneurial orientation and its potential both in theory and practice.\n10 credits\n\n\nStrategic Management\n\n\nThis module examines what we mean by organisational strategy and how strategy is realised in organisations. Strategy can be conceived as the direction and scope of an organisation over the long term and also as an organizational activity and set of practices to do with, for example, strategic analysis and strategic planning as well as processes of negotiation and persuasion. Strategic management entails making distinctive choices that are consequential for the long-term direction, scope and survival of an organisation - often in a turbulent environment, with rapid economic, regulatory, technological, ecological and social changes. Furthermore, strategy formation, implementation, and change involve not just top management, but a variety of organizational members and external stakeholders. On this module you will engage with this complexity through a set of lectures, class discussion and debate, case analysis, and reflection on your experience, with the aim of developing your ability to critically deploy key theories and frameworks to diagnose strategic issues and make informed strategic decisions.\n10 credits\n\n\nEffective and Responsible Leadership\n\n\nThe need for effective and responsible leadership has never been greater, with the ethics and sustainability of organisational practices becoming increasingly scrutinised. Consequently, leading ethically and responsibly is crucial for the financial and socio-ecological sustainability of organisations. This module will explore perspectives on leadership to consider the meanings and practices of leading effectively and responsibly in different contexts. By undertaking a range of classroom activities and developing a reflective portfolio, you will learn to critically reflect on your and others' leadership and followership in order to develop your abilities.\n10 credits\n\n\nInternationalisation Challenge\n\n\nThis module focuses on international business opportunities and the processes, strategies and theories that entrepreneurs, and managers need to follow and apply to pursue them. The primary disciplines for this module are international business, strategy and entrepreneurship which are brought together around the idea that to pursue international opportunities, the firm needs to internationalise, and understand how to do so strategically and effectively. The aim of this module is to enable students to understand and integrate theory and apply it to interpretation and analysis in very specific firm and country contexts, to generate theoretical understanding and practical outcomes for a specified firm.\n10 credits\n\n\nIndividual MBA Challenge\n\n\nThis is an individual project taken towards the end of the Sheffield MBA programme and allows the student to demonstrate the ability to research a management issue within an academic framework and within the context of a specific organisation or industry. It utilises knowledge and skills acquired in the earlier part of the programme, and is executed under the general guidance of a supervisor. The module will also equip students with the frameworks and approaches needed while researching in the field of Management. A dissertation written by the student should be delivered to the School at the conclusion.\n45 credits\n\n\nPersonal, Professional and Career Development\n\n\nThe Personal, Professional and Career Development (PPCD) module is an integral element in the MBA journey, which runs throughout your MBA programme. It is designed to help you cultivate your self awareness and develop the skills needed to achieve your personal, professional and career development goals. This involves personal development and career planning, and setting objectives and identifying strategies to achieve them. The personal element will encompass, for example, self-awareness, self-care, wellbeing, and defining what success means. The professional element is concerned with development activities linked to professionalism and leadership skills development. The career element of this module involves supporting you in achieving your career aspirations which might extend beyond one particular employer or entrepreneurial venture.  These skills include, for example, networking, team working, negotiation, interview skills, etc. The delivery of this module will be through a wide range of in-class learning, interactive sessions led by experts, industry visits and extra-curricular activities.\n5 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n You will select 2 of the 4 elective modules:\n\n\nHuman Resource Management\n\n\nThis module has three objectives.  It is intended to develop an understanding of the international and comparative factors (such as national culture) that shape human resource management.  It will also build functional knowledge of the main tools and techniques used in the HRM field.  Finally, it will develop an awareness of some of the most pertinent HRM issues in Europe, the Far East and America.

The aim of the module is to equip non-financial students with an appropriate level of financial competence - and confidence - and hence view accounting and financial management from the perspective of general management: that is, as users of financial information. This means that learning does not take the form of a series of textbook technical exercises, but grasps concepts and applies them to the real world, as demonstrated on the case company. The accounting element of the module is concerned primarily with the usefulness and limitations of accounting and market data in published financial statements, governance and internal reports and controls, business planning, operational decisions, pricing decisions, and performance management. The financial management element of the module examines the role of accounting and market data to support financing decisions, investing decisions and cash and working capital management.\n10 credits\n\n\nManaging Organisational Behaviour\n\n\nThis unit aims to provide students with an understanding of a systematic set of behavioural science concepts for analysing human behaviour in organisations.  The major theories and research findings in this area derive from the academic disciplines of psychology, sociology and anthropology and students will be expected to familiarise themselves as directed.  Further, the unit provides the opportunity to relate these theoretical concepts to realistic organisational problems and to consider appropriate managerial responses.  In this way, the unit is designed not only to increase the ability to analyse behaviour but also to develop the skill to draw on appropriate concepts to influence and manage others effectively in organisational contexts.\n10 credits\n\n\nOperations Management\n\n\nThis module is concerned with the effective and efficient marshalling of the organisation's resources to meet its objectives. An understanding of fundamental concepts and techniques will be provided and used by students to tackle cases which apply to manufacturing and service industries in both private and public sectors. The systematic and logical approach of Operational Research to the solution of management problems is also introduced.\n10 credits\n\n\nGlobal Managerial Economics\n\n\nThis module focuses on the analysis of factors that affect strategic decisions and performance of firms from an economic perspective. This includes organisation-level factors and issues such as the contractual relationships among the different stakeholders of firms and optimal boundaries of firms, as well as the structure and contestability of markets within which they operate. There is particular emphasis on strategic interactions with competitors, designing of contracts in an environment of imperfect (asymmetric) information, and the role of transactions cost in influencing key strategic decisions  involving both domestic and international operations of firms. Finally, there is discussion about the factors that influence the regulatory and macroeconomic contexts in which firms operate, including the relevance of interconnectedness of economies for domestic macroeconomic and regulatory environments. As such, the aim of the module is to provide a coherent picture of application of economic principles to different aspects of managerial decision making.\n10 credits\n\n\nThe Intelligent Organisation\n\n\nAn intelligent organisation strategically harnesses data and disruptive technologies to achieve its overarching objectives. The insights generated from extensive internal and external data pools empower organisations to operate with enhanced effectiveness and efficiency. For example, Big Data Analytics helps organisations to identify new opportunities and predict future scenarios. Simultaneously, disruptive technologies like Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things further strengthen data-driven organisations by automating underlying business processes. This module therefore focuses on how data and disruptive technologies enable organisations to achieve high levels of digital transformation. It also provides insights into how to assess the readiness for digital transformation and the challenges of delivering digital transformation projects. This module uses interactive lectures, hands-on sessions, guest lectures from industry experts, and case studies to introduce core concepts and their uses in the real world.\n10 credits\n\n\nMarketing Consultancy Challenge\n\n\nThis module integrates consulting with marketing through application on a real company project. You will become familiar with the marketing process, the practice and critical importance of marketing as well as important managerial decisions including those about the choice of the target market, the nature of the offerings and marketing strategies that are aimed at communicating and delivering values. While marketing will provide a set of principles and context, consultancy will provide students with an opportunity to apply theoretically grounded consulting principles into a client based marketing problem. The rationale is that many business consulting projects are driven by the initial need for improvement in markets, products and channels to customers, branding, the design of associated processes etc.\n20 credits\n\n\nPersonal, Professional and Career Development\n\n\nThe Personal, Professional and Career Development (PPCD) module is an integral element in the MBA journey, which runs throughout your MBA programme. It is designed to help you cultivate your self awareness and develop the skills needed to achieve your personal, professional and career development goals. This involves personal development and career planning, and setting objectives and identifying strategies to achieve them. The personal element will encompass, for example, self-awareness, self-care, wellbeing, and defining what success means. The professional element is concerned with development activities linked to professionalism and leadership skills development. The career element of this module involves supporting you in achieving your career aspirations which might extend beyond one particular employer or entrepreneurial venture.  These skills include, for example, networking, team working, negotiation, interview skills, etc. The delivery of this module will be through a wide range of in-class learning, interactive sessions led by experts, industry visits and extra-curricular activities.\n5 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelop your consultancy skills on the AGCAS award nominated Internationalisation Challenge module, as well as the Individual MBA Challenge, collaborating with local clients to drive global impact. Continue developing your understanding of a variety of business functions, tailoring the programme to your interests as you select elective modules. The Personal, Professional and Career Development module will continue to elevate your capabilities, equipping you with the tools and insights to excel as you return to the workplace and make a lasting impact on your career.\n\n\n\n Core modules:\n\n\nNew Venture Creation Challenge\n\n\nThis is a project-based module in which, working in small groups, you will research and develop a business plan for a new venture. With facilitation and coaching, you will select an entrepreneurial idea and develop it into a comprehensive and fully detailed written business plan. All aspects of the business must be thoroughly researched and the written plan must include five years of financial projections. The module also considers what it takes to become more entrepreneurial or 'intrapreneurial', by critically considering to what extent it is possible to replicate entrepreneurial DNA. The module considers the importance of organisational leadership, structure, systems, strategies and cultures. The overarching aim is to enable you to assess entrepreneurial orientation and its potential both in theory and practice.\n10 credits\n\n\nStrategic Management\n\n\nThis module examines what we mean by organisational strategy and how strategy is realised in organisations. Strategy can be conceived as the direction and scope of an organisation over the long term and also as an organizational activity and set of practices to do with, for example, strategic analysis and strategic planning as well as processes of negotiation and persuasion. Strategic management entails making distinctive choices that are consequential for the long-term direction, scope and survival of an organisation - often in a turbulent environment, with rapid economic, regulatory, technological, ecological and social changes. Furthermore, strategy formation, implementation, and change involve not just top management, but a variety of organizational members and external stakeholders. On this module you will engage with this complexity through a set of lectures, class discussion and debate, case analysis, and reflection on your experience, with the aim of developing your ability to critically deploy key theories and frameworks to diagnose strategic issues and make informed strategic decisions.\n10 credits\n\n\nEffective and Responsible Leadership\n\n\nThe need for effective and responsible leadership has never been greater, with the ethics and sustainability of organisational practices becoming increasingly scrutinised. Consequently, leading ethically and responsibly is crucial for the financial and socio-ecological sustainability of organisations. This module will explore perspectives on leadership to consider the meanings and practices of leading effectively and responsibly in different contexts. By undertaking a range of classroom activities and developing a reflective portfolio, you will learn to critically reflect on your and others' leadership and followership in order to develop your abilities.\n10 credits\n\n\nInternationalisation Challenge\n\n\nThis module focuses on international business opportunities and the processes, strategies and theories that entrepreneurs, and managers need to follow and apply to pursue them. The primary disciplines for this module are international business, strategy and entrepreneurship which are brought together around the idea that to pursue international opportunities, the firm needs to internationalise, and understand how to do so strategically and effectively. The aim of this module is to enable students to understand and integrate theory and apply it to interpretation and analysis in very specific firm and country contexts, to generate theoretical understanding and practical outcomes for a specified firm.\n10 credits\n\n\nIndividual MBA Challenge\n\n\nThis is an individual project taken towards the end of the Sheffield MBA programme and allows the student to demonstrate the ability to research a management issue within an academic framework and within the context of a specific organisation or industry. It utilises knowledge and skills acquired in the earlier part of the programme, and is executed under the general guidance of a supervisor. The module will also equip students with the frameworks and approaches needed while researching in the field of Management. A dissertation written by the student should be delivered to the School at the conclusion.\n45 credits\n\n\nPersonal, Professional and Career Development\n\n\nThe Personal, Professional and Career Development (PPCD) module is an integral element in the MBA journey, which runs throughout your MBA programme. It is designed to help you cultivate your self awareness and develop the skills needed to achieve your personal, professional and career development goals. This involves personal development and career planning, and setting objectives and identifying strategies to achieve them. The personal element will encompass, for example, self-awareness, self-care, wellbeing, and defining what success means. The professional element is concerned with development activities linked to professionalism and leadership skills development. The career element of this module involves supporting you in achieving your career aspirations which might extend beyond one particular employer or entrepreneurial venture.  These skills include, for example, networking, team working, negotiation, interview skills, etc. The delivery of this module will be through a wide range of in-class learning, interactive sessions led by experts, industry visits and extra-curricular activities.\n5 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n You will select 2 of the 4 elective modules:\n\n\nHuman Resource Management\n\n\nThis module has three objectives.  It is intended to develop an understanding of the international and comparative factors (such as national culture) that shape human resource management.

Finally, it will develop an awareness of some of the most pertinent HRM issues in Europe, the Far East and America.  Teaching methods for the option will combine the project method, formal lectures, videos, case study analysis, analysis of example HRM tools and techniques and Powerpoint presentations.\n10 credits\n\n\nStrategic Management Accounting\n\n\nThis module explores the way in which management accounting information can play an important role in the strategic development of organisations.

The concept of strategic management accounting is relevant for both private and public sector organisations.\n10 credits\n\n\nCorporate Finance\n\n\nThis module examines how corporate decision-makers determine policies on funding and firm investment choices. It assesses both areas by scrutinizing background theory and real applications. The module addresses some of the pivotal areas of concern for financial decision-makers, including the formulation of recommendations and policies on investment appraisal, corporate leverage, dividend policy, stock buy-backs, risk management, and CSR-engagement. The module will address such issues within the context of perfect (frictionless) and imperfect market settings and will also stress the role of external capital markets (debt and equity) in relation to the growth cycle of a listed firm.\n10 credits\n\n\nOrganisational Crisis Management\n\n\nCrisis management is an emerging area of management research and practice reflecting the growing scope and scale for organisational disruptions. This module adopts a processual and broad systems perspective to understanding how crises can emerge in organisations and how best managers might prepare for, mitigate and manage these. This is an integrative module which draws upon multi-disciplinary perspectives to provide learners with conceptual insights and analytical tools needed to be effective managers.

The aim of the module is to equip non-financial students with an appropriate level of financial competence - and confidence - and hence view accounting and financial management from the perspective of general management: that is, as users of financial information. This means that learning does not take the form of a series of textbook technical exercises, but grasps concepts and applies them to the real world, as demonstrated on the case company. The accounting element of the module is concerned primarily with the usefulness and limitations of accounting and market data in published financial statements, governance and internal reports and controls, business planning, operational decisions, pricing decisions, and performance management. The financial management element of the module examines the role of accounting and market data to support financing decisions, investing decisions and cash and working capital management.\n10 credits\n\n\nManaging Organisational Behaviour\n\n\nThis unit aims to provide students with an understanding of a systematic set of behavioural science concepts for analysing human behaviour in organisations.  The major theories and research findings in this area derive from the academic disciplines of psychology, sociology and anthropology and students will be expected to familiarise themselves as directed.  Further, the unit provides the opportunity to relate these theoretical concepts to realistic organisational problems and to consider appropriate managerial responses.  In this way, the unit is designed not only to increase the ability to analyse behaviour but also to develop the skill to draw on appropriate concepts to influence and manage others effectively in organisational contexts.\n10 credits\n\n\nOperations Management\n\n\nThis module is concerned with the effective and efficient marshalling of the organisation's resources to meet its objectives. An understanding of fundamental concepts and techniques will be provided and used by students to tackle cases which apply to manufacturing and service industries in both private and public sectors. The systematic and logical approach of Operational Research to the solution of management problems is also introduced.\n10 credits\n\n\nGlobal Managerial Economics\n\n\nThis module focuses on the analysis of factors that affect strategic decisions and performance of firms from an economic perspective. This includes organisation-level factors and issues such as the contractual relationships among the different stakeholders of firms and optimal boundaries of firms, as well as the structure and contestability of markets within which they operate. There is particular emphasis on strategic interactions with competitors, designing of contracts in an environment of imperfect (asymmetric) information, and the role of transactions cost in influencing key strategic decisions  involving both domestic and international operations of firms. Finally, there is discussion about the factors that influence the regulatory and macroeconomic contexts in which firms operate, including the relevance of interconnectedness of economies for domestic macroeconomic and regulatory environments. As such, the aim of the module is to provide a coherent picture of application of economic principles to different aspects of managerial decision making.\n10 credits\n\n\nThe Intelligent Organisation\n\n\nAn intelligent organisation strategically harnesses data and disruptive technologies to achieve its overarching objectives. The insights generated from extensive internal and external data pools empower organisations to operate with enhanced effectiveness and efficiency. For example, Big Data Analytics helps organisations to identify new opportunities and predict future scenarios. Simultaneously, disruptive technologies like Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things further strengthen data-driven organisations by automating underlying business processes. This module therefore focuses on how data and disruptive technologies enable organisations to achieve high levels of digital transformation. It also provides insights into how to assess the readiness for digital transformation and the challenges of delivering digital transformation projects. This module uses interactive lectures, hands-on sessions, guest lectures from industry experts, and case studies to introduce core concepts and their uses in the real world.\n10 credits\n\n\nMarketing Consultancy Challenge\n\n\nThis module integrates consulting with marketing through application on a real company project. You will become familiar with the marketing process, the practice and critical importance of marketing as well as important managerial decisions including those about the choice of the target market, the nature of the offerings and marketing strategies that are aimed at communicating and delivering values. While marketing will provide a set of principles and context, consultancy will provide students with an opportunity to apply theoretically grounded consulting principles into a client based marketing problem. The rationale is that many business consulting projects are driven by the initial need for improvement in markets, products and channels to customers, branding, the design of associated processes etc.\n20 credits\n\n\nPersonal, Professional and Career Development\n\n\nThe Personal, Professional and Career Development (PPCD) module is an integral element in the MBA journey, which runs throughout your MBA programme. It is designed to help you cultivate your self awareness and develop the skills needed to achieve your personal, professional and career development goals. This involves personal development and career planning, and setting objectives and identifying strategies to achieve them. The personal element will encompass, for example, self-awareness, self-care, wellbeing, and defining what success means. The professional element is concerned with development activities linked to professionalism and leadership skills development. The career element of this module involves supporting you in achieving your career aspirations which might extend beyond one particular employer or entrepreneurial venture.  These skills include, for example, networking, team working, negotiation, interview skills, etc. The delivery of this module will be through a wide range of in-class learning, interactive sessions led by experts, industry visits and extra-curricular activities.\n5 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelop your consultancy skills on the AGCAS award nominated Internationalisation Challenge module, as well as the Individual MBA Challenge, collaborating with local clients to drive global impact. Continue developing your understanding of a variety of business functions, tailoring the programme to your interests as you select elective modules. The Personal, Professional and Career Development module will continue to elevate your capabilities, equipping you with the tools and insights to excel as you return to the workplace and make a lasting impact on your career.\n\n\n\n Core modules:\n\n\nNew Venture Creation Challenge\n\n\nThis is a project-based module in which, working in small groups, you will research and develop a business plan for a new venture. With facilitation and coaching, you will select an entrepreneurial idea and develop it into a comprehensive and fully detailed written business plan. All aspects of the business must be thoroughly researched and the written plan must include five years of financial projections. The module also considers what it takes to become more entrepreneurial or 'intrapreneurial', by critically considering to what extent it is possible to replicate entrepreneurial DNA. The module considers the importance of organisational leadership, structure, systems, strategies and cultures. The overarching aim is to enable you to assess entrepreneurial orientation and its potential both in theory and practice.\n10 credits\n\n\nStrategic Management\n\n\nThis module examines what we mean by organisational strategy and how strategy is realised in organisations. Strategy can be conceived as the direction and scope of an organisation over the long term and also as an organizational activity and set of practices to do with, for example, strategic analysis and strategic planning as well as processes of negotiation and persuasion. Strategic management entails making distinctive choices that are consequential for the long-term direction, scope and survival of an organisation - often in a turbulent environment, with rapid economic, regulatory, technological, ecological and social changes. Furthermore, strategy formation, implementation, and change involve not just top management, but a variety of organizational members and external stakeholders. On this module you will engage with this complexity through a set of lectures, class discussion and debate, case analysis, and reflection on your experience, with the aim of developing your ability to critically deploy key theories and frameworks to diagnose strategic issues and make informed strategic decisions.\n10 credits\n\n\nEffective and Responsible Leadership\n\n\nThe need for effective and responsible leadership has never been greater, with the ethics and sustainability of organisational practices becoming increasingly scrutinised. Consequently, leading ethically and responsibly is crucial for the financial and socio-ecological sustainability of organisations. This module will explore perspectives on leadership to consider the meanings and practices of leading effectively and responsibly in different contexts. By undertaking a range of classroom activities and developing a reflective portfolio, you will learn to critically reflect on your and others' leadership and followership in order to develop your abilities.\n10 credits\n\n\nInternationalisation Challenge\n\n\nThis module focuses on international business opportunities and the processes, strategies and theories that entrepreneurs, and managers need to follow and apply to pursue them. The primary disciplines for this module are international business, strategy and entrepreneurship which are brought together around the idea that to pursue international opportunities, the firm needs to internationalise, and understand how to do so strategically and effectively. The aim of this module is to enable students to understand and integrate theory and apply it to interpretation and analysis in very specific firm and country contexts, to generate theoretical understanding and practical outcomes for a specified firm.\n10 credits\n\n\nIndividual MBA Challenge\n\n\nThis is an individual project taken towards the end of the Sheffield MBA programme and allows the student to demonstrate the ability to research a management issue within an academic framework and within the context of a specific organisation or industry. It utilises knowledge and skills acquired in the earlier part of the programme, and is executed under the general guidance of a supervisor. The module will also equip students with the frameworks and approaches needed while researching in the field of Management. A dissertation written by the student should be delivered to the School at the conclusion.\n45 credits\n\n\nPersonal, Professional and Career Development\n\n\nThe Personal, Professional and Career Development (PPCD) module is an integral element in the MBA journey, which runs throughout your MBA programme. It is designed to help you cultivate your self awareness and develop the skills needed to achieve your personal, professional and career development goals. This involves personal development and career planning, and setting objectives and identifying strategies to achieve them. The personal element will encompass, for example, self-awareness, self-care, wellbeing, and defining what success means. The professional element is concerned with development activities linked to professionalism and leadership skills development. The career element of this module involves supporting you in achieving your career aspirations which might extend beyond one particular employer or entrepreneurial venture.  These skills include, for example, networking, team working, negotiation, interview skills, etc. The delivery of this module will be through a wide range of in-class learning, interactive sessions led by experts, industry visits and extra-curricular activities.\n5 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n You will select 2 of the 4 elective modules:\n\n\nHuman Resource Management\n\n\nThis module has three objectives.  It is intended to develop an understanding of the international and comparative factors (such as national culture) that shape human resource management.  It will also build functional knowledge of the main tools and techniques used in the HRM field.  Finally, it will develop an awareness of some of the most pertinent HRM issues in Europe, the Far East and America.  Teaching methods for the option will combine the project method, formal lectures, videos, case study analysis, analysis of example HRM tools and techniques and Powerpoint presentations.\n10 credits\n\n\nStrategic Management Accounting\n\n\nThis module explores the way in which management accounting information can play an important role in the strategic development of organisations. It recognises the need for management accounting to be more externally focussed and for it to provide information that helps organisations face up to strategic uncertainties. The concept of strategic management accounting is relevant for both private and public sector organisations.\n10 credits\n\n\nCorporate Finance\n\n\nThis module examines how corporate decision-makers determine policies on funding and firm investment choices. It assesses both areas by scrutinizing background theory and real applications. The module addresses some of the pivotal areas of concern for financial decision-makers, including the formulation of recommendations and policies on investment appraisal, corporate leverage, dividend policy, stock buy-backs, risk management, and CSR-engagement. The module will address such issues within the context of perfect (frictionless) and imperfect market settings and will also stress the role of external capital markets (debt and equity) in relation to the growth cycle of a listed firm.\n10 credits\n\n\nOrganisational Crisis Management\n\n\nCrisis management is an emerging area of management research and practice reflecting the growing scope and scale for organisational disruptions. This module adopts a processual and broad systems perspective to understanding how crises can emerge in organisations and how best managers might prepare for, mitigate and manage these. This is an integrative module which draws upon multi-disciplinary perspectives to provide learners with conceptual insights and analytical tools needed to be effective managers. The teaching strategy is underpinned by case studies developed by the module leader and others. This approach allows students to enhance their critical and analytical skills by evaluating real world management practice and developing their own crisis management abilities through formulating appropriate strategic and operational responses.\n10 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content of our courses is reviewed annually to make sure it's up-to-date and relevant.

You will apply teachings from the Professional, Personal and Career Development module to build real relationships and expand your professional network, laying the foundations for success as you embark on your MBA journey. \n\n\n\n Core modules:\n\n\nAccounting and Financial Management\n\n\nAs managers in businesses, social enterprises or governmental organisations, an ability to interpret accounting reports and exercise financial judgment is essential. The aim of the module is to equip non-financial students with an appropriate level of financial competence - and confidence - and hence view accounting and financial management from the perspective of general management: that is, as users of financial information. This means that learning does not take the form of a series of textbook technical exercises, but grasps concepts and applies them to the real world, as demonstrated on the case company. The accounting element of the module is concerned primarily with the usefulness and limitations of accounting and market data in published financial statements, governance and internal reports and controls, business planning, operational decisions, pricing decisions, and performance management. The financial management element of the module examines the role of accounting and market data to support financing decisions, investing decisions and cash and working capital management.\n10 credits\n\n\nManaging Organisational Behaviour\n\n\nThis unit aims to provide students with an understanding of a systematic set of behavioural science concepts for analysing human behaviour in organisations.  The major theories and research findings in this area derive from the academic disciplines of psychology, sociology and anthropology and students will be expected to familiarise themselves as directed.  Further, the unit provides the opportunity to relate these theoretical concepts to realistic organisational problems and to consider appropriate managerial responses.  In this way, the unit is designed not only to increase the ability to analyse behaviour but also to develop the skill to draw on appropriate concepts to influence and manage others effectively in organisational contexts.\n10 credits\n\n\nOperations Management\n\n\nThis module is concerned with the effective and efficient marshalling of the organisation's resources to meet its objectives. An understanding of fundamental concepts and techniques will be provided and used by students to tackle cases which apply to manufacturing and service industries in both private and public sectors. The systematic and logical approach of Operational Research to the solution of management problems is also introduced.\n10 credits\n\n\nGlobal Managerial Economics\n\n\nThis module focuses on the analysis of factors that affect strategic decisions and performance of firms from an economic perspective. This includes organisation-level factors and issues such as the contractual relationships among the different stakeholders of firms and optimal boundaries of firms, as well as the structure and contestability of markets within which they operate. There is particular emphasis on strategic interactions with competitors, designing of contracts in an environment of imperfect (asymmetric) information, and the role of transactions cost in influencing key strategic decisions  involving both domestic and international operations of firms. Finally, there is discussion about the factors that influence the regulatory and macroeconomic contexts in which firms operate, including the relevance of interconnectedness of economies for domestic macroeconomic and regulatory environments. As such, the aim of the module is to provide a coherent picture of application of economic principles to different aspects of managerial decision making.\n10 credits\n\n\nThe Intelligent Organisation\n\n\nAn intelligent organisation strategically harnesses data and disruptive technologies to achieve its overarching objectives. The insights generated from extensive internal and external data pools empower organisations to operate with enhanced effectiveness and efficiency. For example, Big Data Analytics helps organisations to identify new opportunities and predict future scenarios. Simultaneously, disruptive technologies like Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things further strengthen data-driven organisations by automating underlying business processes. This module therefore focuses on how data and disruptive technologies enable organisations to achieve high levels of digital transformation. It also provides insights into how to assess the readiness for digital transformation and the challenges of delivering digital transformation projects. This module uses interactive lectures, hands-on sessions, guest lectures from industry experts, and case studies to introduce core concepts and their uses in the real world.\n10 credits\n\n\nMarketing Consultancy Challenge\n\n\nThis module integrates consulting with marketing through application on a real company project. You will become familiar with the marketing process, the practice and critical importance of marketing as well as important managerial decisions including those about the choice of the target market, the nature of the offerings and marketing strategies that are aimed at communicating and delivering values. While marketing will provide a set of principles and context, consultancy will provide students with an opportunity to apply theoretically grounded consulting principles into a client based marketing problem. The rationale is that many business consulting projects are driven by the initial need for improvement in markets, products and channels to customers, branding, the design of associated processes etc.\n20 credits\n\n\nPersonal, Professional and Career Development\n\n\nThe Personal, Professional and Career Development (PPCD) module is an integral element in the MBA journey, which runs throughout your MBA programme. It is designed to help you cultivate your self awareness and develop the skills needed to achieve your personal, professional and career development goals. This involves personal development and career planning, and setting objectives and identifying strategies to achieve them. The personal element will encompass, for example, self-awareness, self-care, wellbeing, and defining what success means. The professional element is concerned with development activities linked to professionalism and leadership skills development. The career element of this module involves supporting you in achieving your career aspirations which might extend beyond one particular employer or entrepreneurial venture.  These skills include, for example, networking, team working, negotiation, interview skills, etc. The delivery of this module will be through a wide range of in-class learning, interactive sessions led by experts, industry visits and extra-curricular activities.\n5 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelop your consultancy skills on the AGCAS award nominated Internationalisation Challenge module, as well as the Individual MBA Challenge, collaborating with local clients to drive global impact. Continue developing your understanding of a variety of business functions, tailoring the programme to your interests as you select elective modules. The Personal, Professional and Career Development module will continue to elevate your capabilities, equipping you with the tools and insights to excel as you return to the workplace and make a lasting impact on your career.\n\n\n\n Core modules:\n\n\nNew Venture Creation Challenge\n\n\nThis is a project-based module in which, working in small groups, you will research and develop a business plan for a new venture. With facilitation and coaching, you will select an entrepreneurial idea and develop it into a comprehensive and fully detailed written business plan. All aspects of the business must be thoroughly researched and the written plan must include five years of financial projections. The module also considers what it takes to become more entrepreneurial or 'intrapreneurial', by critically considering to what extent it is possible to replicate entrepreneurial DNA. The module considers the importance of organisational leadership, structure, systems, strategies and cultures. The overarching aim is to enable you to assess entrepreneurial orientation and its potential both in theory and practice.\n10 credits\n\n\nStrategic Management\n\n\nThis module examines what we mean by organisational strategy and how strategy is realised in organisations. Strategy can be conceived as the direction and scope of an organisation over the long term and also as an organizational activity and set of practices to do with, for example, strategic analysis and strategic planning as well as processes of negotiation and persuasion. Strategic management entails making distinctive choices that are consequential for the long-term direction, scope and survival of an organisation - often in a turbulent environment, with rapid economic, regulatory, technological, ecological and social changes. Furthermore, strategy formation, implementation, and change involve not just top management, but a variety of organizational members and external stakeholders. On this module you will engage with this complexity through a set of lectures, class discussion and debate, case analysis, and reflection on your experience, with the aim of developing your ability to critically deploy key theories and frameworks to diagnose strategic issues and make informed strategic decisions.\n10 credits\n\n\nEffective and Responsible Leadership\n\n\nThe need for effective and responsible leadership has never been greater, with the ethics and sustainability of organisational practices becoming increasingly scrutinised. Consequently, leading ethically and responsibly is crucial for the financial and socio-ecological sustainability of organisations. This module will explore perspectives on leadership to consider the meanings and practices of leading effectively and responsibly in different contexts. By undertaking a range of classroom activities and developing a reflective portfolio, you will learn to critically reflect on your and others' leadership and followership in order to develop your abilities.\n10 credits\n\n\nInternationalisation Challenge\n\n\nThis module focuses on international business opportunities and the processes, strategies and theories that entrepreneurs, and managers need to follow and apply to pursue them. The primary disciplines for this module are international business, strategy and entrepreneurship which are brought together around the idea that to pursue international opportunities, the firm needs to internationalise, and understand how to do so strategically and effectively. The aim of this module is to enable students to understand and integrate theory and apply it to interpretation and analysis in very specific firm and country contexts, to generate theoretical understanding and practical outcomes for a specified firm.\n10 credits\n\n\nIndividual MBA Challenge\n\n\nThis is an individual project taken towards the end of the Sheffield MBA programme and allows the student to demonstrate the ability to research a management issue within an academic framework and within the context of a specific organisation or industry. It utilises knowledge and skills acquired in the earlier part of the programme, and is executed under the general guidance of a supervisor. The module will also equip students with the frameworks and approaches needed while researching in the field of Management. A dissertation written by the student should be delivered to the School at the conclusion.\n45 credits\n\n\nPersonal, Professional and Career Development\n\n\nThe Personal, Professional and Career Development (PPCD) module is an integral element in the MBA journey, which runs throughout your MBA programme. It is designed to help you cultivate your self awareness and develop the skills needed to achieve your personal, professional and career development goals. This involves personal development and career planning, and setting objectives and identifying strategies to achieve them. The personal element will encompass, for example, self-awareness, self-care, wellbeing, and defining what success means. The professional element is concerned with development activities linked to professionalism and leadership skills development. The career element of this module involves supporting you in achieving your career aspirations which might extend beyond one particular employer or entrepreneurial venture.  These skills include, for example, networking, team working, negotiation, interview skills, etc. The delivery of this module will be through a wide range of in-class learning, interactive sessions led by experts, industry visits and extra-curricular activities.\n5 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n You will select 2 of the 4 elective modules:\n\n\nHuman Resource Management\n\n\nThis module has three objectives.  It is intended to develop an understanding of the international and comparative factors (such as national culture) that shape human resource management.  It will also build functional knowledge of the main tools and techniques used in the HRM field.  Finally, it will develop an awareness of some of the most pertinent HRM issues in Europe, the Far East and America.  Teaching methods for the option will combine the project method, formal lectures, videos, case study analysis, analysis of example HRM tools and techniques and Powerpoint presentations.\n10 credits\n\n\nStrategic Management Accounting\n\n\nThis module explores the way in which management accounting information can play an important role in the strategic development of organisations. It recognises the need for management accounting to be more externally focussed and for it to provide information that helps organisations face up to strategic uncertainties. The concept of strategic management accounting is relevant for both private and public sector organisations.\n10 credits\n\n\nCorporate Finance\n\n\nThis module examines how corporate decision-makers determine policies on funding and firm investment choices. It assesses both areas by scrutinizing background theory and real applications. The module addresses some of the pivotal areas of concern for financial decision-makers, including the formulation of recommendations and policies on investment appraisal, corporate leverage, dividend policy, stock buy-backs, risk management, and CSR-engagement. The module will address such issues within the context of perfect (frictionless) and imperfect market settings and will also stress the role of external capital markets (debt and equity) in relation to the growth cycle of a listed firm.\n10 credits\n\n\nOrganisational Crisis Management\n\n\nCrisis management is an emerging area of management research and practice reflecting the growing scope and scale for organisational disruptions. This module adopts a processual and broad systems perspective to understanding how crises can emerge in organisations and how best managers might prepare for, mitigate and manage these. This is an integrative module which draws upon multi-disciplinary perspectives to provide learners with conceptual insights and analytical tools needed to be effective managers. The teaching strategy is underpinned by case studies developed by the module leader and others. This approach allows students to enhance their critical and analytical skills by evaluating real world management practice and developing their own crisis management abilities through formulating appropriate strategic and operational responses.\n10 credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content of our courses is reviewed annually to make sure it's up-to-date and relevant.

The systematic and logical approach of Operational Research to the solution of management problems is also introduced.\n10 credits\nGlobal Managerial Economics: This module focuses on the analysis of factors that affect strategic decisions and performance of firms from an economic perspective. This includes organisation-level factors and issues such as the contractual relationships among the different stakeholders of firms and optimal boundaries of firms, as well as the structure and contestability of markets within which they operate. There is particular emphasis on strategic interactions with competitors, designing of contracts in an environment of imperfect (asymmetric) information, and the role of transactions cost in influencing key strategic decisions  involving both domestic and international operations of firms. Finally, there is discussion about the factors that influence the regulatory and macroeconomic contexts in which firms operate, including the relevance of interconnectedness of economies for domestic macroeconomic and regulatory environments. As such, the aim of the module is to provide a coherent picture of application of economic principles to different aspects of managerial decision making.\n10 credits\nThe Intelligent Organisation: An intelligent organisation strategically harnesses data and disruptive technologies to achieve its overarching objectives. The insights generated from extensive internal and external data pools empower organisations to operate with enhanced effectiveness and efficiency. For example, Big Data Analytics helps organisations to identify new opportunities and predict future scenarios. Simultaneously, disruptive technologies like Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things further strengthen data-driven organisations by automating underlying business processes. This module therefore focuses on how data and disruptive technologies enable organisations to achieve high levels of digital transformation. It also provides insights into how to assess the readiness for digital transformation and the challenges of delivering digital transformation projects. This module uses interactive lectures, hands-on sessions, guest lectures from industry experts, and case studies to introduce core concepts and their uses in the real world.\n10 credits\nMarketing Consultancy Challenge: This module integrates consulting with marketing through application on a real company project. You will become familiar with the marketing process, the practice and critical importance of marketing as well as important managerial decisions including those about the choice of the target market, the nature of the offerings and marketing strategies that are aimed at communicating and delivering values. While marketing will provide a set of principles and context, consultancy will provide students with an opportunity to apply theoretically grounded consulting principles into a client based marketing problem. The rationale is that many business consulting projects are driven by the initial need for improvement in markets, products and channels to customers, branding, the design of associated processes etc.\n20 credits\nPersonal, Professional and Career Development: The Personal, Professional and Career Development (PPCD) module is an integral element in the MBA journey, which runs throughout your MBA programme. It is designed to help you cultivate your self awareness and develop the skills needed to achieve your personal, professional and career development goals. This involves personal development and career planning, and setting objectives and identifying strategies to achieve them. The personal element will encompass, for example, self-awareness, self-care, wellbeing, and defining what success means. The professional element is concerned with development activities linked to professionalism and leadership skills development. The career element of this module involves supporting you in achieving your career aspirations which might extend beyond one particular employer or entrepreneurial venture.  These skills include, for example, networking, team working, negotiation, interview skills, etc. The delivery of this module will be through a wide range of in-class learning, interactive sessions led by experts, industry visits and extra-curricular activities.\n5 credits\n[DEFINITION_LIST]\nNew Venture Creation Challenge: This is a project-based module in which, working in small groups, you will research and develop a business plan for a new venture. With facilitation and coaching, you will select an entrepreneurial idea and develop it into a comprehensive and fully detailed written business plan. All aspects of the business must be thoroughly researched and the written plan must include five years of financial projections. The module also considers what it takes to become more entrepreneurial or 'intrapreneurial', by critically considering to what extent it is possible to replicate entrepreneurial DNA. The module considers the importance of organisational leadership, structure, systems, strategies and cultures. The overarching aim is to enable you to assess entrepreneurial orientation and its potential both in theory and practice.\n10 credits\nStrategic Management: This module examines what we mean by organisational strategy and how strategy is realised in organisations. Strategy can be conceived as the direction and scope of an organisation over the long term and also as an organizational activity and set of practices to do with, for example, strategic analysis and strategic planning as well as processes of negotiation and persuasion. Strategic management entails making distinctive choices that are consequential for the long-term direction, scope and survival of an organisation - often in a turbulent environment, with rapid economic, regulatory, technological, ecological and social changes. Furthermore, strategy formation, implementation, and change involve not just top management, but a variety of organizational members and external stakeholders. On this module you will engage with this complexity through a set of lectures, class discussion and debate, case analysis, and reflection on your experience, with the aim of developing your ability to critically deploy key theories and frameworks to diagnose strategic issues and make informed strategic decisions.\n10 credits\nEffective and Responsible Leadership: The need for effective and responsible leadership has never been greater, with the ethics and sustainability of organisational practices becoming increasingly scrutinised. Consequently, leading ethically and responsibly is crucial for the financial and socio-ecological sustainability of organisations. This module will explore perspectives on leadership to consider the meanings and practices of leading effectively and responsibly in different contexts. By undertaking a range of classroom activities and developing a reflective portfolio, you will learn to critically reflect on your and others' leadership and followership in order to develop your abilities.\n10 credits\nInternationalisation Challenge: This module focuses on international business opportunities and the processes, strategies and theories that entrepreneurs, and managers need to follow and apply to pursue them. The primary disciplines for this module are international business, strategy and entrepreneurship which are brought together around the idea that to pursue international opportunities, the firm needs to internationalise, and understand how to do so strategically and effectively. The aim of this module is to enable students to understand and integrate theory and apply it to interpretation and analysis in very specific firm and country contexts, to generate theoretical understanding and practical outcomes for a specified firm.\n10 credits\nIndividual MBA Challenge: This is an individual project taken towards the end of the Sheffield MBA programme and allows the student to demonstrate the ability to research a management issue within an academic framework and within the context of a specific organisation or industry. It utilises knowledge and skills acquired in the earlier part of the programme, and is executed under the general guidance of a supervisor. The module will also equip students with the frameworks and approaches needed while researching in the field of Management. A dissertation written by the student should be delivered to the School at the conclusion.\n45 credits\nPersonal, Professional and Career Development: The Personal, Professional and Career Development (PPCD) module is an integral element in the MBA journey, which runs throughout your MBA programme. It is designed to help you cultivate your self awareness and develop the skills needed to achieve your personal, professional and career development goals. This involves personal development and career planning, and setting objectives and identifying strategies to achieve them.

It is intended to develop an understanding of the international and comparative factors (such as national culture) that shape human resource management.  It will also build functional knowledge of the main tools and techniques used in the HRM field.  Finally, it will develop an awareness of some of the most pertinent HRM issues in Europe, the Far East and America.  Teaching methods for the option will combine the project method, formal lectures, videos, case study analysis, analysis of example HRM tools and techniques and Powerpoint presentations.\n10 credits\nStrategic Management Accounting: This module explores the way in which management accounting information can play an important role in the strategic development of organisations. It recognises the need for management accounting to be more externally focussed and for it to provide information that helps organisations face up to strategic uncertainties. The concept of strategic management accounting is relevant for both private and public sector organisations.\n10 credits\nCorporate Finance: This module examines how corporate decision-makers determine policies on funding and firm investment choices. It assesses both areas by scrutinizing background theory and real applications. The module addresses some of the pivotal areas of concern for financial decision-makers, including the formulation of recommendations and policies on investment appraisal, corporate leverage, dividend policy, stock buy-backs, risk management, and CSR-engagement. The module will address such issues within the context of perfect (frictionless) and imperfect market settings and will also stress the role of external capital markets (debt and equity) in relation to the growth cycle of a listed firm.\n10 credits\nOrganisational Crisis Management: Crisis management is an emerging area of management research and practice reflecting the growing scope and scale for organisational disruptions. This module adopts a processual and broad systems perspective to understanding how crises can emerge in organisations and how best managers might prepare for, mitigate and manage these. This is an integrative module which draws upon multi-disciplinary perspectives to provide learners with conceptual insights and analytical tools needed to be effective managers. The teaching strategy is underpinned by case studies developed by the module leader and others. This approach allows students to enhance their critical and analytical skills by evaluating real world management practice and developing their own crisis management abilities through formulating appropriate strategic and operational responses.\n10 credits\n[CARD]\nMBA (Master of Business Administration)\nMBA\n2025-26 entry\nMBA (Master of Business Administration)\nMBA\n\n\n      \n            \n                \n      Management School,\n\n                  Faculty of Social Sciences\n\n\n          Holding prestigious Triple Crown accreditation and Tier One status in CEO Magazine's Global MBA Rankings, the Sheffield MBA is the Management School’s flagship programme and has been running since 1969.\n    \n\n\nStart date\n\n          September 2025\n      \n\nDuration\n\n1 year\n\n\nAttendance\n\nFull-time\n\n\n\n Accredited\n Course fee\n\n\n\nApply for this course\nRegister for updates\n[CARD]\nExplore this course:\n[CARD]\nWe're revising the curriculum of this course for this year of entry and are in the process of confirming the modules.

The aim of the module is to equip non-financial students with an appropriate level of financial competence - and confidence - and hence view accounting and financial management from the perspective of general management: that is, as users of financial information. This means that learning does not take the form of a series of textbook technical exercises, but grasps concepts and applies them to the real world, as demonstrated on the case company. The accounting element of the module is concerned primarily with the usefulness and limitations of accounting and market data in published financial statements, governance and internal reports and controls, business planning, operational decisions, pricing decisions, and performance management. The financial management element of the module examines the role of accounting and market data to support financing decisions, investing decisions and cash and working capital management.\n10 credits\n\n\nManaging Organisational Behaviour\n\n\nThis unit aims to provide students with an understanding of a systematic set of behavioural science concepts for analysing human behaviour in organisations.  The major theories and research findings in this area derive from the academic disciplines of psychology, sociology and anthropology and students will be expected to familiarise themselves as directed.  Further, the unit provides the opportunity to relate these theoretical concepts to realistic organisational problems and to consider appropriate managerial responses.  In this way, the unit is designed not only to increase the ability to analyse behaviour but also to develop the skill to draw on appropriate concepts to influence and manage others effectively in organisational contexts.\n10 credits\n\n\nOperations Management\n\n\nThis module is concerned with the effective and efficient marshalling of the organisation's resources to meet its objectives.

As my previous roles were tied to how business operates, I found having structured knowledge about business would be essential for my career growth. In addition, an MBA is perceived as essential for people who want to build more connections. Hence, I knew it would also be beneficial for me as it would open up more opportunities with the international connections I could establish.\nAside from its Triple Crown accreditation, placing Sheffield University Management School into the top one per cent of business and management schools in the world, I also wanted to study the Sheffield MBA because of the programme's focus on Leadership, Entrepreneurship and Consultancy. This is a unique combination that fit perfectly with what I needed - I particularly wanted to develop my understanding of SME matters. The curriculum is developed around those themes, with experiential learning at the core.\nAt first I found moving to the UK very challenging, even though studying in the country was my childhood dream. However, being independent far away from the comfort of home was quite stressful, not to mention adapting to winter blues, bland food and challenging times during the pandemic.\nHowever, once all the anxieties faded, it became very convenient living in Sheffield. It is quite a small city compared to Jakarta, but it offered a fresh change. I was fond of its beautiful parks and historical landmarks, its hilly topography, tranquil but homely ambience, and the convenience of travelling in between places by walking which was something I could never do in Jakarta.\nWhilst I was working, I was attending an intensive bootcamp after work so re-adapting to university life wasn't too challenging for me. However, what I struggled with the most was academic writing and all the assignments as my home country has a different academic approach from the UK, hence I need to brush up my writing skills. For this I was grateful that the University offered additional support in the form of resources and extra classes with practice to help me understand how to write well.\nI highly valued the Challenge modules, such as the Marketing Consultancy Challenge and the Internationalisation Challenge, as they were very practical and helped me to understand more about real-world business problems and how to solve them. I got to work with and interview UK government officials and business owners which was a very insightful and unforgettable experience.\nI found the Personal, Professional and Career Development module to be essential in guiding my next career path. Through this module, I developed a stronger understanding of what success really means for me, polished my strategic soft skills such as negotiation and interview skills and had the opportunity to attend talks from business professionals with various backgrounds.\nAs part of my dissertation, I worked on a company project which revolved around the internationalisation process for one of the UK's food and beverage start-ups. Working with the start-up was quite a challenge, as there were two founders with conflicting schedules. Their availability was also limited, so I needed to be creative and resourceful in working with them. From this project, I gained a lot of experience from understanding the internationalisation process and the bureaucracy and set up needed, to gaining stakeholder management skills.\nThe Sheffield MBA has definitely changed my thought process. The programme has helped me to think more analytically, critically and in a structured manner. In addition to that, I was also trained to see the bigger picture and think strategically. This helps me to approach my work in a similar manner which has gained praise from my employers.\nAfter graduating, I went back to Indonesia and deepened my expertise as a digital marketer in a multinational digital agency. Two years later I felt the need to grow my career by moving to the Netherlands and expanding my skill sets there. I love it here because I get to learn a lot of things - from polishing up stakeholder management and cross-cultural communication, to managing paid search campaigns at an international level in a few markets.\nLooking ahead, I aim to be a distinguished digital marketing leader with a data-driven approach. With this in mind, I need to master several aspects of digital marketing that can help me to gain this title. Beyond that, I aspire to open my own digital marketing consultancy to support SME enterprises with their digital marketing strategies.\nKnow what you want to get out of your MBA.

I was fond of its beautiful parks and historical landmarks, its hilly topography, tranquil but homely ambience, and the convenience of travelling in between places by walking which was something I could never do in Jakarta.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe UK has a different academic approach from my home country which I needed to adjust to\nWhilst I was working, I was attending an intensive bootcamp after work so re-adapting to university life wasn't too challenging for me. However, what I struggled with the most was academic writing and all the assignments as my home country has a different academic approach from the UK, hence I need to brush up my writing skills. For this I was grateful that the University offered additional support in the form of resources and extra classes with practice to help me understand how to write well.\nThe Sheffield MBA helped me to understand how to solve real-world business problems\nI highly valued the Challenge modules, such as the Marketing Consultancy Challenge and the Internationalisation Challenge, as they were very practical and helped me to understand more about real-world business problems and how to solve them. I got to work with and interview UK government officials and business owners which was a very insightful and unforgettable experience.\nI found the Personal, Professional and Career Development module to be essential in guiding my next career path. Through this module, I developed a stronger understanding of what success really means for me, polished my strategic soft skills such as negotiation and interview skills and had the opportunity to attend talks from business professionals with various backgrounds.\nAs part of my dissertation, I worked on a company project which revolved around the internationalisation process for one of the UK's food and beverage start-ups. Working with the start-up was quite a challenge, as there were two founders with conflicting schedules. Their availability was also limited, so I needed to be creative and resourceful in working with them. From this project, I gained a lot of experience from understanding the internationalisation process and the bureaucracy and set up needed, to gaining stakeholder management skills.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe programme trained me to see the bigger picture\nThe Sheffield MBA has definitely changed my thought process. The programme has helped me to think more analytically, critically and in a structured manner. In addition to that, I was also trained to see the bigger picture and think strategically. This helps me to approach my work in a similar manner which has gained praise from my employers.\nI have continued my learning journey following my MBA experience\nAfter graduating, I went back to Indonesia and deepened my expertise as a digital marketer in a multinational digital agency. Two years later I felt the need to grow my career by moving to the Netherlands and expanding my skill sets there. I love it here because I get to learn a lot of things - from polishing up stakeholder management and cross-cultural communication, to managing paid search campaigns at an international level in a few markets.\nLooking ahead, I aim to be a distinguished digital marketing leader with a data-driven approach. With this in mind, I need to master several aspects of digital marketing that can help me to gain this title. Beyond that, I aspire to open my own digital marketing consultancy to support SME enterprises with their digital marketing strategies.\nMy advice for future MBA students\nKnow what you want to get out of your MBA. Be proactive in determining your next steps. Both of these things will be really helpful in enjoying your time studying the Sheffield MBA.",

It started when I took the entrepreneurial leap and co-founded a startup called Quastio, where we built a CRM system for universities. That experience really opened my eyes to the world of product development and got me hooked on creating solutions that make a difference.\nAfter that initial venture, I moved on to larger companies where I worked on some fascinating projects. At AppZoy Technologies, I led teams developing B2B and B2C products. Then at TELiBrahma Technologies, I managed the development of educational tools that made operations more efficient. My journey continued with roles at Covelense Technologies, where I headed a team working on a SaaS CRM platform, and then at Sage Intacct, where I got to work on construction ERP software. Throughout these roles, I was always involved in product development, team leadership, and using data to make better decisions.\nLooking back, each role taught me something valuable - from managing teams and products to understanding customer needs - but I felt I needed something more to take my career to the next level. After spending years in the software industry, I realized my true passion wasn't just in building solutions - it was in shaping the strategic direction of products and leading teams. While I loved the technical aspects of my work, I found myself increasingly drawn to the business side of things, especially during my time as a product owner. This is is what led me to the Sheffield MBA.\nThe University of Sheffield stood out to me for several key reasons. The Triple Crown accreditation was a major draw, as it puts the school in the global elite of business education.\nThe Sheffield MBA really caught my eye because of its three core pillars - leadership, entrepreneurship and consultancy. What made it even more appealing was how they keep the cohort small and intimate, treating each student as an individual rather than just another number. The focus on experiential learning was exactly what I was looking for and what I needed. Instead of just theoretical knowledge, we got to work on real organizational challenges and apply our learning directly to live business situations.\nMoving to Sheffield was actually a pretty smooth transition for me, largely thanks to my long-standing connection with British culture through shows like Doctor Who, Monty Python and Black Adder. These childhood favourites had already given me a glimpse into British life and humour, making everything feel somewhat familiar when I arrived.\nThe city's charm really won me over quickly. Sheffield has this perfect blend of urban life and natural beauty that's hard to find elsewhere. The Peak District right on our doorstep became my weekend escape - perfect for hiking and reconnecting with nature after busy weeks of MBA studies. The city's industrial heritage is beautifully preserved alongside modern developments, and the stunning European architecture I'd always admired in books was now part of my daily life. The historic buildings of the university itself added to that sense of being somewhere special.\nAs someone who always enjoyed learning, I was thrilled to return to an academic environment, though it did take some adjustment. The full-day schedule of four days a week was intense, but the engaging content and practical approach made it worthwhile. The MBA introduced me to people from all over the world, and these friendships made the transition back into studying even easier as well.\nThe Management School's support network was exceptional. The staff went above and beyond to help our success - from academic guidance to career development. Sabrina, Sarah, Bekki, and Marian, among many others, were all instrumental in my journey, providing constant support while keeping us motivated and focused. The career support was particularly impressive, with dedicated coaching sessions helping us navigate our professional goals. The networking opportunities provided valuable connections with industry professionals, which proved invaluable for our career progression.\nThe course hit a perfect balance between theory and hands-on practice through real-world challenges. Working on live consulting projects with actual businesses was both challenging and rewarding. We created business plans and pitched to real investors in the New Venture Creation Challenge, and worked with local companies on their international expansion strategies. These weren't just academic exercises - they were real projects with real impact.\nThe London Career Safari was definitely a standout moment. We spent several days in London meeting industry leaders, attending workshops, and networking with successful professionals. The sessions with experts and entrepreneurs opened my eyes to new career possibilities.\nWhat made the experience special was the close-knit community. Being part of a small cohort meant we formed strong bonds with classmates from diverse backgrounds. The networking events, both in Sheffield and London, connected us with alumni and industry professionals who shared invaluable insights about their career journey.\nThrough targeted sessions with industry leaders and alumni, I gained invaluable insights into executive-level communication and stakeholder management. The module helped me to polish my presentation skills and taught me how to effectively engage with senior leadership - skills that I now use daily in my role as I interact with company directors.\nWhat made PPCD particularly valuable was its focus on real-world application. The personality development workshops and executive communication training weren't just theoretical - they were practical tools that transformed how I approach professional relationships. The alumni mentoring sessions were especially enlightening, showing us concrete examples of how MBA skills translate into various leadership roles. These experiences have significantly enhanced my ability to manage stakeholders and navigate complex business relationships in my current position at Scientifica.\nI opted for a company project rather than a traditional dissertation, working with a media company on their marketing strategy. The project focused on conducting a comprehensive marketing audit and customer analysis, which proved to be an incredibly practical learning experience. The project involved diving deep into customer ratings and reviews to develop a targeted marketing framework. I analyzed both qualitative and quantitative customer data, which helped uncover valuable insights about customer behaviour and preferences. One of the most rewarding aspects was creating a structured approach to customer profiling and segmentation.\nThe skills I developed during this project have been directly applicable to my current role at Scientifica. I now regularly use similar analytical approaches to understand market dynamics and customer sentiment. The experience taught me how to establish meaningful KPIs and translate raw data into actionable business strategies. Looking back, choosing a company project was definitely the right decision as it provided real-world experience that I use every day in my product development role.\nAfter completing my MBA, I started working at Scientifica, a leading manufacturer of cutting-edge neuroscience and life sciences research equipment, as their Head of Product Development. It's been an interesting transition from my software background to the scientific instrumentation industry, where I now lead cross-functional teams in developing innovative products that empower researchers worldwide. My current role involves shaping product strategy and managing the entire product lifecycle from ideation to launch. I work closely with various departments, establishing frameworks for product development and customer feedback analysis. A significant part of my responsibility includes developing the product portfolio and vision while managing P&L and reporting directly to the directors.\nWhat makes this role particularly engaging is the blend of strategic thinking and practical implementation. I conduct market research, align with stakeholders, and foster a data-driven, user-centered approach to decision-making. Working with leadership to shape business strategy ensures our cutting-edge equipment continues to meet the evolving needs of our global scientific community. The MBA equipped me with crucial skills in analyzing market needs, understanding customer perspectives, and making data-driven strategic decisions.\nBuilding on my current role at Scientifica, I aim to expand my impact in the industry by leading larger product portfolios and driving innovation that makes a real difference in research capabilities. My goal is to advance into executive-level product leadership positions, similar to my current directors, where I can shape organizational strategy and guide the development of groundbreaking products. Having successfully transitioned from software to scientific instrumentation, I'm excited to continue growing in this field, leveraging my unique blend of technical expertise and strategic business acumen to develop products that empower researchers worldwide.\nIf you're considering the Sheffield MBA, my biggest advice would be to fully immerse yourself in the experience - both inside and outside the classroom. The programme is intense, but the relationships you build with your cohort become your greatest support system and network. Make time to explore Sheffield's unique charm, from the vibrant city centre to the beautiful Peak District. Take advantage of every opportunity, whether it's networking events, consulting projects, or career development workshops. The diverse perspectives from your international classmates are brilliant, and the friendships you form will last well beyond graduation.

Then at TELiBrahma Technologies, I managed the development of educational tools that made operations more efficient. My journey continued with roles at Covelense Technologies, where I headed a team working on a SaaS CRM platform, and then at Sage Intacct, where I got to work on construction ERP software. Throughout these roles, I was always involved in product development, team leadership, and using data to make better decisions.Looking back, each role taught me something valuable - from managing teams and products to understanding customer needs - but I felt I needed something more to take my career to the next level. After spending years in the software industry, I realized my true passion wasn't just in building solutions - it was in shaping the strategic direction of products and leading teams. While I loved the technical aspects of my work, I found myself increasingly drawn to the business side of things, especially during my time as a product owner. This is is what led me to the Sheffield MBA.The MBA's core pillars really caught my eyeThe University of Sheffield stood out to me for several key reasons. The Triple Crown accreditation was a major draw, as it puts the school in the global elite of business education.The Sheffield MBA really caught my eye because of its three core pillars - leadership, entrepreneurship and consultancy. What made it even more appealing was how they keep the cohort small and intimate, treating each student as an individual rather than just another number. The focus on experiential learning was exactly what I was looking for and what I needed. Instead of just theoretical knowledge, we got to work on real organizational challenges and apply our learning directly to live business situations.Sheffield's charm won me over quicklyMoving to Sheffield was actually a pretty smooth transition for me, largely thanks to my long-standing connection with British culture through shows like Doctor Who, Monty Python and Black Adder. These childhood favourites had already given me a glimpse into British life and humour, making everything feel somewhat familiar when I arrived.The city's charm really won me over quickly. Sheffield has this perfect blend of urban life and natural beauty that's hard to find elsewhere. The Peak District right on our doorstep became my weekend escape - perfect for hiking and reconnecting with nature after busy weeks of MBA studies. The city's industrial heritage is beautifully preserved alongside modern developments, and the stunning European architecture I'd always admired in books was now part of my daily life. The historic buildings of the university itself added to that sense of being somewhere special.Getting back into academic life after a decade in the corporate world was both challenging and excitingAs someone who always enjoyed learning, I was thrilled to return to an academic environment, though it did take some adjustment. The full-day schedule of four days a week was intense, but the engaging content and practical approach made it worthwhile. The MBA introduced me to people from all over the world, and these friendships made the transition back into studying even easier as well.The Management School's support network was exceptional. The staff went above and beyond to help our success - from academic guidance to career development. Sabrina, Sarah, Bekki, and Marian, among many others, were all instrumental in my journey, providing constant support while keeping us motivated and focused. The career support was particularly impressive, with dedicated coaching sessions helping us navigate our professional goals. The networking opportunities provided valuable connections with industry professionals, which proved invaluable for our career progression.The MBA was packed with incredible experiences beyond traditional classroom learningThe course hit a perfect balance between theory and hands-on practice through real-world challenges. Working on live consulting projects with actual businesses was both challenging and rewarding. We created business plans and pitched to real investors in the New Venture Creation Challenge, and worked with local companies on their international expansion strategies. These weren't just academic exercises - they were real projects with real impact.The London Career Safari was definitely a standout moment. We spent several days in London meeting industry leaders, attending workshops, and networking with successful professionals. The sessions with experts and entrepreneurs opened my eyes to new career possibilities.What made the experience special was the close-knit community. Being part of a small cohort meant we formed strong bonds with classmates from diverse backgrounds. The networking events, both in Sheffield and London, connected us with alumni and industry professionals who shared invaluable insights about their career journey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Personal, Professional and Career Development module was a game changer for my professional growthThrough targeted sessions with industry leaders and alumni, I gained invaluable insights into executive-level communication and stakeholder management. The module helped me to polish my presentation skills and taught me how to effectively engage with senior leadership - skills that I now use daily in my role as I interact with company directors.What made PPCD particularly valuable was its focus on real-world application. The personality development workshops and executive communication training weren't just theoretical - they were practical tools that transformed how I approach professional relationships. The alumni mentoring sessions were especially enlightening, showing us concrete examples of how MBA skills translate into various leadership roles. These experiences have significantly enhanced my ability to manage stakeholders and navigate complex business relationships in my current position at Scientifica.The skills I developed through my Individual MBA Challenge company project have been directly applicable to my current roleI opted for a company project rather than a traditional dissertation, working with a media company on their marketing strategy. The project focused on conducting a comprehensive marketing audit and customer analysis, which proved to be an incredibly practical learning experience. The project involved diving deep into customer ratings and reviews to develop a targeted marketing framework. I analyzed both qualitative and quantitative customer data, which helped uncover valuable insights about customer behaviour and preferences. One of the most rewarding aspects was creating a structured approach to customer profiling and segmentation.The skills I developed during this project have been directly applicable to my current role at Scientifica. I now regularly use similar analytical approaches to understand market dynamics and customer sentiment. The experience taught me how to establish meaningful KPIs and translate raw data into actionable business strategies. Looking back, choosing a company project was definitely the right decision as it provided real-world experience that I use every day in my product development role.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince graduating, I've taken on the exciting role of Head of Product Development at ScientificaAfter completing my MBA, I started working at Scientifica, a leading manufacturer of cutting-edge neuroscience and life sciences research equipment, as their Head of Product Development. It's been an interesting transition from my software background to the scientific instrumentation industry, where I now lead cross-functional teams in developing innovative products that empower researchers worldwide. My current role involves shaping product strategy and managing the entire product lifecycle from ideation to launch. I work closely with various departments, establishing frameworks for product development and customer feedback analysis. A significant part of my responsibility includes developing the product portfolio and vision while managing P&L and reporting directly to the directors.What makes this role particularly engaging is the blend of strategic thinking and practical implementation. I conduct market research, align with stakeholders, and foster a data-driven, user-centered approach to decision-making. Working with leadership to shape business strategy ensures our cutting-edge equipment continues to meet the evolving needs of our global scientific community. The MBA equipped me with crucial skills in analyzing market needs, understanding customer perspectives, and making data-driven strategic decisions.Looking ahead...Building on my current role at Scientifica, I aim to expand my impact in the industry by leading larger product portfolios and driving innovation that makes a real difference in research capabilities. My goal is to advance into executive-level product leadership positions, similar to my current directors, where I can shape organizational strategy and guide the development of groundbreaking products. Having successfully transitioned from software to scientific instrumentation, I'm excited to continue growing in this field, leveraging my unique blend of technical expertise and strategic business acumen to develop products that empower researchers worldwide.My advice for future MBA studentsIf you're considering the Sheffield MBA, my biggest advice would be to fully immerse yourself in the experience - both inside and outside the classroom. The programme is intense, but the relationships you build with your cohort become your greatest support system and network. Make time to explore Sheffield's unique charm, from the vibrant city centre to the beautiful Peak District. Take advantage of every opportunity, whether it's networking events, consulting projects, or career development workshops. The diverse perspectives from your international classmates are brilliant, and the friendships you form will last well beyond graduation. The MBA is not just about academic achievement - it's about personal growth, professional development, and building lasting connections that will support your future career journey.",

While I had several career interests, such as starting my own business or transitioning to venture capital, I thought it might be valuable to take a step back to broaden my perspective and fill in any gaps in my business knowledge. That's why I decided to pursue an MBA.\nThe city of Sheffield has a lively city centre where you can find everything you need for daily life, and when I wanted to relax, there was a beautiful, lush park just a short walk from my accommodation. This balance between urban life and nature quickly helped me settle into a comfortable life. To adapt to my new life in education, I made an effort to establish a routine. On weekdays, I would wake up at the same time each day, made time to go to the gym before heading to the Management School, and then spending evenings in the study room preparing for the next day's classes. While the assignments were very intense, working on them daily with my cohort provided mutual support and became a great source of encouragement.\nI wanted to learn each module not just as academic knowledge but as practical tools that could be applied in business. Sheffield University Management School and the Sheffield MBA offers opportunities to apply knowledge gained from modules to solve real business challenges faced by companies, such as through Marketing Consultancy Challenge and Internationalisation Challenge. The numerous opportunities for such active and practical learning were invaluable experiences. The process of working as a team, where members with diverse backgrounds leveraged their individual strengths to develop optimal solutions, greatly contributed to my learning and personal growth.\nThrough my MBA I gained a broad business knowledge in areas like marketing, finance, corporate strategy, and leadership. In addition, the diverse experiences here also greatly broadened my perspective. Spending a long time in the same place with the same people can narrow one's thinking. The Sheffield MBA brings together people from diverse backgrounds, and this diversity can truly lead to the discovery of the career one wants to pursue.\nIn today's era of high uncertainty, developing a career strategy is more than ever and the MBA programme enabled me to do this. The Personal, Professional and Career Development module provided me with an opportunity for mid and long term career development through self reflection from various angles. Through my MBA, I was able to identify the career I wanted to pursue, meet my current company through dissertation research, and actually stand at the starting line of that career. This is something I definitely could not have achieved without the Sheffield MBA.\nI chose to follow the traditional dissertation pathway for the Individual MBA Challenge because I wanted to set my own research theme. When deciding on a topic, I was considering pursuing a future career in venture capital, so I researched the Japanese Venture Capital (VC) industry and its added value under the theme “Exploring the impact of venture capital on startups beyond the funding function in Japan”.\nDuring my dissertation research process, I interviewed several venture capitalists in Japan. During one of these interviews, a participant suggested that mint, a seed-phase focused VC firm, would be a good fit for me. Coincidentally, I had an interview scheduled with mint's General Partner the very next day! When I actually spoke with him, I felt their corporate culture and investment policy were perfect for me. I proceeded with their selection process and was fortunately received an offer as a venture capitalist.\nAs a venture capitalist, I want to help create as many companies as possible that will represent Japan's future. Whilst Japan hasn’t seen the emergence of large corporations like Toyota for some time, there are actually many startups with high potential. I want to contribute to Japanese society by investing in and providing management support to such startups from their seed stage.\nThe biggest piece of advice I would give to people considering the Sheffield MBA is to take that first step. While living in a new place and returning to studies might bring some anxiety and stress, in Sheffield you will find a comfortable living environment, wonderful cohorts and academics, and practical, effective modules. Through your experience here, you will surely gain many new experiences and opportunities for growth.\n[GRID_TABLE]\nNetworking through my dissertation led to a job opportunity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n                  Jun Bekku\n    \n    \n    \n\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n                  Postgraduate student\n    \n    \n    \n\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n                  The Sheffield MBA\n    \n    \n    \n\n\nJun, who came to Sheffield from Japan, reflects on his MBA experience, sharing how his dissertation research and the opportunity to set his own research topic led him to find a job opportunity.

To adapt to my new life in education, I made an effort to establish a routine. On weekdays, I would wake up at the same time each day, made time to go to the gym before heading to the Management School, and then spending evenings in the study room preparing for the next day's classes. While the assignments were very intense, working on them daily with my cohort provided mutual support and became a great source of encouragement.\nThe Sheffield MBA offers opportunities to apply knowledge to solve real business challenges\nI wanted to learn each module not just as academic knowledge but as practical tools that could be applied in business. Sheffield University Management School and the Sheffield MBA offers opportunities to apply knowledge gained from modules to solve real business challenges faced by companies, such as through Marketing Consultancy Challenge and Internationalisation Challenge. The numerous opportunities for such active and practical learning were invaluable experiences. The process of working as a team, where members with diverse backgrounds leveraged their individual strengths to develop optimal solutions, greatly contributed to my learning and personal growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThrough my MBA, I was able to identify the career I wanted to pursue\nThrough my MBA I gained a broad business knowledge in areas like marketing, finance, corporate strategy, and leadership. In addition, the diverse experiences here also greatly broadened my perspective. Spending a long time in the same place with the same people can narrow one's thinking. The Sheffield MBA brings together people from diverse backgrounds, and this diversity can truly lead to the discovery of the career one wants to pursue.\nIn today's era of high uncertainty, developing a career strategy is more than ever and the MBA programme enabled me to do this. The Personal, Professional and Career Development module provided me with an opportunity for mid and long term career development through self reflection from various angles. Through my MBA, I was able to identify the career I wanted to pursue, meet my current company through dissertation research, and actually stand at the starting line of that career. This is something I definitely could not have achieved without the Sheffield MBA.\nI tailored my dissertation topic to my specific career interests\nI chose to follow the traditional dissertation pathway for the Individual MBA Challenge because I wanted to set my own research theme. When deciding on a topic, I was considering pursuing a future career in venture capital, so I researched the Japanese Venture Capital (VC) industry and its added value under the theme “Exploring the impact of venture capital on startups beyond the funding function in Japan”.\nDuring my dissertation research process, I interviewed several venture capitalists in Japan. During one of these interviews, a participant suggested that mint, a seed-phase focused VC firm, would be a good fit for me. Coincidentally, I had an interview scheduled with mint's General Partner the very next day! When I actually spoke with him, I felt their corporate culture and investment policy were perfect for me. I proceeded with their selection process and was fortunately received an offer as a venture capitalist.\nAs a venture capitalist, I want to help create as many companies as possible that will represent Japan's future. Whilst Japan hasn’t seen the emergence of large corporations like Toyota for some time, there are actually many startups with high potential. I want to contribute to Japanese society by investing in and providing management support to such startups from their seed stage.\nThe Sheffield MBA will give you many opportunities for growth\nThe biggest piece of advice I would give to people considering the Sheffield MBA is to take that first step. While living in a new place and returning to studies might bring some anxiety and stress, in Sheffield you will find a comfortable living environment, wonderful cohorts and academics, and practical, effective modules. Through your experience here, you will surely gain many new experiences and opportunities for growth.\n[GRID_TABLE]\nNetworking through my dissertation led to a job opportunity\nJun Bekku\n    \n    \n    \n\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n                  Postgraduate student\n    \n    \n    \n\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n                  The Sheffield MBA\n    \n    \n    \n\n\nJun, who came to Sheffield from Japan, reflects on his MBA experience, sharing how his dissertation research and the opportunity to set his own research topic led him to find a job opportunity.

For students from England, the agency is Student Finance England.\nWhether you qualify for a postgraduate doctoral loan depends on your course, your age, and your nationality or residency status.\nYou will not be able to get a postgraduate doctoral loan if you already have a doctoral degree, or a qualification that’s equivalent or higher. You will also not be able to get a postgraduate doctoral loan if you’ve received or will receive Research Council funding (for example, studentships, stipends, scholarships and tuition fee support).\nThere are additional criteria that may mean you are not eligible for a postgraduate doctoral loan. For more information about eligibility, please refer to the government website.\nGov.uk - Doctoral loan - Eligibility\nYour course must be a full, standalone doctoral course, have started on or after 1 August 2018, last between 3 to 8 academic years, and be provided by a university in the UK with research degree awarding powers.\nIt can be full-time or part-time and taught or research-based (or a combination of both).\nYou can apply for a loan if your doctoral programme includes an integrated master’s degree (even if you already have a master’s degree).

The loan will be paid directly to you in three instalments of 33%, 33% and 34% each year. You get the first payment after your course start date, once the University confirms that you’ve registered.\nApplications usually open in the May or June before you start your course.\nYou only need to apply once for a postgraduate doctoral loan for your course.\nYou need to apply within 9 months of the first day of the last academic year of the course.\nFor more information, please refer to the government website.\nGov.uk - Doctoral loan - How to apply\nLoan repayments will usually commence from the April after course completion at the earliest (or the April 4 years after the course started if you’re studying part-time and your course is longer than 4 years) and only when your income is over the repayment threshold set by the government: this is currently £21,000 a year for postgraduate loan repayment plans.\nGov.uk - Repaying your student loan - When you start repaying\nYour repayments will be taken out of your salary at the same time as tax and National Insurance if you’re an employee.

If you're self-employed, you'll pay through HM Revenue and Customs.\nGov.uk - Repaying your student loan - How to repay\nHow much you repay depends on your income. You’ll repay a percentage of your income over the repayment threshold set by the government (currently £21,000 for postgraduate loan repayment plans).\nThe doctoral loan repayment will be calculated at 6% of income above the repayment threshold.\nRepayments will be made concurrently alongside repayment of any outstanding undergraduate student loan.\nYour repayments are based on what you earn, not what you owe. If your wages drop, this is reflected in your repayments. For more information, please refer to the government website.\nGov.uk - Repaying your student loan - How much you repay\nYou can choose to make extra repayments towards your student loan. For more information, please refer to the government website.\nGov.uk - Repaying your student loan - Make extra repayments\nYour postgraduate doctoral loan will be written off 30 years after the April you were first due to repay.\nThe loan's interest rate will usually be calculated at the Retail Price Index (RPI) plus 3%.

When this is ready we'll send you an email containing your applicant and choice numbers. You should normally receive this email within two working days. We'll then send your application for academic consideration.\nYou can check the progress of your application at any time simply by logging back into your online application.\nIf we need to contact you we'll do so by email, so please make sure that you check the email account you used for your application, and that this account is set to trust messages coming from @shef.ac.uk and @sheffield.ac.uk addresses. You may wish to add admissions@sheffield.ac.uk to your address book to avoid important messages being marked as spam.\nIf you change your email address, please let us know by emailing us at admissions@sheffield.ac.uk, including your full name and applicant number.\nFor most taught courses, it normally takes academic departments around four weeks to make decisions on applications. It can take longer at busy times.\nFor some of our courses, we may invite you to attend an interview with staff from your academic department. You can find information on what to expect in an interview in our guidance:\nWhen we've made our decision, it will appear in your online application, and we'll also send you an email to confirm this.\nIf we've offered you a study place, we'll provide you with an official electronic offer letter detailing any conditions and the amount payable for the tuition fees. The offer letter will be attached to our email and also available for you to download from your online application.\nIf we haven't offered you a study place and you would like feedback on this decision, you should contact the academic department directly in writing. You can find their contact details under the relevant entry in our postgraduate taught course listings.\nIf we make you an offer, it will be either Conditional or Unconditional.\nA Conditional offer means that there are requirements that you need to meet before you can start the course, for example a certain English language score, or a minimum grade in your current studies.\nAn Unconditional offer means that there are no further academic requirements that you need to meet.\nIf we've made you a Conditional offer, the conditions will be stated in your offer letter. When you've met these conditions, you should upload to your online application documents that prove it. When you've met all the conditions of your offer, we'll provide you with a new, Unconditional offer letter.\nThe standard deadlines for meeting the conditions of your offer are provided on our key dates and deadlines page. A few courses use different deadlines. If this is the case for your course, it will be indicated in your offer letter.\nIf you have any problems attaching documents to your online application, please contact us.\nWe normally determine the final mark of an international degree by calculating the average of all the module marks, weighted by credit value. For module marks assigned as a range, we use the mid-point of the range. Note that the average we calculate may differ from the average shown on your transcript.\nAn Unconditional offer has no conditions. You just need to let us know whether or not you want to accept or decline our offer of a study place.\nIn most cases, you can accept or decline the offer of a study place via your online application. If you're not able to do this, please let us know your decision by emailing us at admissions@sheffield.ac.uk. When you accept an offer, you also accept our Terms and Conditions upon Acceptance of an Offer.\nExcept where indicated in the offer letter, there are no specific deadlines for accepting an offer. However, we encourage applicants to make a decision within three months of receiving an offer. Also, the sooner you accept an offer, the sooner you'll be able to make other arrangements (for example your accommodation or visa).\nYou can accept only one Unconditional offer of a place. If you've received Unconditional offers for more than one course, you'll need to choose which course to accept. You should then decline the other offers.\nIf you're an International applicant, we'll normally ask you to pay a deposit on your tuition fee after you accept an Unconditional offer. We'll tell you more about this, including how you can pay, in your Unconditional offer letter.\nTuition fee deposits\nIf you want to withdraw from the application process, please contact us. We'll then update your application record.\nIf we've offered you a study place and you will be unable to attend at the start of your course, you may be able to defer your entry to the next admission point. Most postgraduate taught courses have one admission per year, at the start of the autumn semester in September/October.\nFor most courses, you can request a deferral through your original online application by clicking on the 'Request Deferral' link in the 'Your Applications' section. Requesting a deferral will deactivate your current offer, so you should only request one when you're sure that you can't start on the original start date. If you aren't sure, we would advise you to submit a new application for the next admission point, when applications open for that year.\nIf the academic selectors approve your request, we'll send you an amended offer letter with a deferred start date.\nYou should submit your deferral request by the deadline published on our key dates webpage. You can defer your application a maximum of two times. If want to defer for a third time, we'll ask you to re-apply.\nDeferral requests are reviewed by our admissions selectors, then we'll let you know the decision. Please note that we can't always review deferral requests when we receive them, and we can't issue deferred offers until after the new admissions year has begun, usually in September. We'll acknowledge receipt of your request within two weeks.\nUniversity of Sheffield offer-holders are entitled to access the members area of our website, MUSE (My University of Sheffield Environment).
