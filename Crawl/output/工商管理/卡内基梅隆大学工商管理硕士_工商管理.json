We give equal consideration to every aspect of your application — goals, background, accomplishments — in order to determine if the Tepper MBA program is a good fit for you.\nYour Tepper MBA application will contain a variety of components that provide the admissions committee information to assess your candidacy for our MBA program. Through our review process, we do not assign specific weights to the various parts of the application.\nThe following application components are required:\n✓  Online application form✓  Current resume✓  One written essay and one video essay✓  One professional recommendation*✓  Unofficial transcripts of all academic work✓  Official GMAT, GRE, or EA score, or approved test waiver✓  Official TOEFL or IELTS score (if applicable)✓  $200 application fee\nOnce admitted, candidates will be required to submit official transcripts.\nReview application component details\nTo safeguard the integrity of the admissions process, Carnegie Mellon University routinely uses a third-party company, Re Vera, to conduct verification procedures of all candidates who accept our offer of admission.\nStart by reviewing the application components below. We ask you to provide a bit of personal, professional, and educational information to get to know you better.\nWe suggest that you create your essay and goals and then sit down to complete the online form. We provide a time estimate at the top of each page in the online application. You'll only need about 30 minutes to complete the entire online application form.\nUpload a copy of your resume. The purpose of this document is to provide a snapshot of your education and professional achievements in your career. Use a standard (i.e. Times New Roman or Arial), 12-pt. font for your 1-2 page resume.\nPro Tip: It is important to include month and year for starting and ending dates for each position held. If this key information is not included, we will ask for an updated resume, which may delay your application.\nSuccessful applicants will hold a four-year, bachelor’s degree from an accredited college or university in the U.S. or an equivalent degree from a foreign country. You will provide details of your education for each institution that you attended. Additionally, admission to the MBA program requires candidates to have taken one semester of college-level calculus with the letter grade of B or better. Those who do not meet this requirement will be required to successfully complete Tepper’s Calculus Fundamentals course prior to matriculation.\nYou will upload transcripts from all undergraduate and graduate programs you have attended or are attending. These may be copies of transcripts that you already have in your possession. However, these cannot be web transcripts. A web transcript is anything obtained from an online student portal, downloaded from your student record, or retrieved online.\nTranscripts uploaded during the application process are considered “unofficial.” What makes a transcript \"unofficial\" is that you have it in your possession instead of us receiving it in a sealed, stamped envelope directly from your university.\nPro Tip: View a sample of a web transcript that you should avoid submitting.\nAll candidates are required to upload legible, scanned/digitized copies of their unofficial transcripts and degree certificates which include the following:\nPro Tip: If your uploaded transcript doesn’t include all the required information, we will need to contact you to send the missing items, and your application may be delayed.\nPro Tip: Official transcripts (those sent directly by the degree-granting institution) are not required during the application process. Should you be admitted, you will be required to submit official transcripts later.\nThe Tepper School accepts the GMAT, GMAT Focus, GRE, and Executive Assessment (EA). Successful candidates submitting an EA score will have extensive quantitative academic coursework and/or will have professional experience in a STEM-related field. One of these tests is required regardless of previous advanced academic work or professional experience.\nWe accept both in-person and online versions of the GMAT, GMAT Focus, GRE, TOEFL and IELTS.\nOnce we receive the official score, we will update your application checklist accordingly.\nRequest that the official score is sent to us using the following instructions:\nGMAT and Executive Assessment: Select the program that applies:\nFull-Time MBA: 69H-XH-99 Part-Time Flex MBA: 69H-XH-02 Part-Time Online Hybrid MBA: 69H-XH-01Part-Time Accelerated MBA: 69H-XH-01\nGRE Program Code: Carnegie Mellon Tepper School of Business: 4883\nPro Tip: GMAT and GRE scores are valid for five years and must be valid at the time you submit your application.\nPro Tip: If you have taken the GMAT/GRE more than once, report the highest overall score from any one testing date when completing the online application.\nOur Tepper MBA program is focused on the success of our students in the classroom and in employment outcomes. The application process allows us to assess readiness of candidates and provide guidance in improving future academic and career outcomes.\nWe believe standardized exams are one way that business programs gauge academic readiness; however, while many Tepper MBA applicants will submit a GMAT/GRE/EA score, we also recognize there are multiple ways to demonstrate academic readiness. This is the reason we offer a test waiver option.\nHere is some guidance on our test waiver option:\nUpon submission of your application, the waiver request will be reviewed, and you will receive a response to the waiver request via email within 10 business days of the application deadline. Please note, only complete applications will be reviewed for test waivers.\nIf you are applying through the Consortium for Graduate Study in Management (CGSM), make sure you have read the Consortium application instructions and meet the requirements to submit an application through the Consortium.\nIf you would like to apply for a standardized test waiver, complete this form by Oct. 15 for Round 1 or Jan. 5 for Round 2.\nIf you receive a test waiver approval from the Tepper School, forward a copy of the waiver confirmation to the Consortium to complete your application. Upon completion of your application, it will be forwarded to the Tepper School.\nCandidates are required to demonstrate a level of competence in English to meet the admissions requirements of the university. You are required to take a TOEFL, IELTS, or Duolingo exam unless:\nYou must request that the official score be sent from the testing agency to our program for us to verify the score entered into the application. Request that the official score be sent to us using the following codes:\nTOEFL Program Code: Institutional Code = 2074; Organization: Carnegie Mellon University, Graduate Business Organization\nPro Tip: TOEFL and IELTS scores are valid for two years and must be valid at the time you submit your application.\nPro Tip: If you earned a degree from a non-U.S. institution, your academic documents should state that the sole language of instruction for the entire university was English in order to be eligible for a TOEFL/IELTS/Duolingo waiver. If your academic documents don’t include this, you should upload an official letter from the University Registrar indicating English as the mode of instruction for the entirety of the degree.\nThere is one required essay (maximum 500 words) for all Tepper MBA applicants (except college seniors). You are now able to choose which essay question resonates most with you and how you can present your best application. Please choose 1 of the following 2 questions. We do not have a preference on which question you answer. Here are the 2 options:\nCollege Seniors applying through the Tepper Future Business Leaders should answer the essays provided in the Deferred Admission for College Seniors section.\nThere also is an optional essay for additional information about your candidacy that you may wish to share with the admissions committee. Use this essay to convey important information that you may not have otherwise been able to convey. This may include unexplained resume gaps, context for recommender selection, etc. However, do not feel obligated to complete the optional essay.\nAre you a re-applicant? Use the optional essay to explain how your candidacy has strengthened since your last application.\nWe know this is an important component of your decision to attend business school. We take it seriously as well. Please describe your post-MBA career goals.\nIt would be helpful to consider the following information in your response:\nWe require just one recommendation. Ideally, you would pick a supervisor (current or previous), however, anyone who can speak to your professional work experience in detail would be appropriate.\n*For Online Hybrid MBA Applicants Only - For applicants who are applying with less than 2 years of postgraduate work experience, we require two letters of recommendation. We recommend selecting a professional supervisor or someone who has overseen your work in an academic or community-based setting.\nWe use the GMAC Common Letter of Recommendation (LOR). The Common LOR is intended to save you and your recommender valuable time by providing a single set of recommendation questions for each participating school. This allows your recommender to use the same answers for multiple letter submissions, alleviating the workload of having to answer different questions for each school multiple times. You benefit because it makes the ask for several different letters to be written on your behalf much easier.\nA $200 application fee is required of all applicants. This fee can be paid online using a credit card at the time of submission.\nYou may earn an application fee waiver by completing Chart Your Path Toward Admission. Please choose the appropriate path to get started\nOnce you have completed your online application, if you have any supporting documents, they should be uploaded directly to your application via your application status page in the application portal.\nIf you have submitted all the application components, it isn’t necessary to send anything else to us at this point. Upon admission, you’ll need to send your official transcripts/academic documents. These details will be included in the admission letter, so no need to worry about it now.\nFollowing submission of your application, you may be invited to interview with a member of our MBA Admissions team. Our evaluative interviews are by invitation only and are required.\nWe begin to invite applicants to interview within one week of the application deadline. However, you may receive an invitation any time prior to the decision notification date.\nAt the Tepper School, the Admissions team conducts behavioral interviews. The behavioral interview technique is used to review a candidate’s specific experiences and behaviors in an attempt to predict his or her potential for success at the Tepper School.\nWe are particularly interested in learning about candidates' skills and perspectives on teamwork, leadership, success, and failure. To prepare, we suggest that you:\nStudents enrolled in a part-time program are not eligible for a U.S. student visa. International applicants who reside outside of the U.S. will be asked to provide details regarding how they plan to attend Access Weekends. International students who cannot legally enter the U.S. to attend Access Weekends are not eligible for admission to our part-time MBA programs.\nIf you have submitted an application for the Tepper MBA program within the last year, you will be able to log into the site with the same email address and password that you used last year. Some of the information from last year will carry over but you will need to fill in anything that is missing before you submit your new application. However, we will waive your application fee.\nInterviews will be granted only at the invitation of the admissions committee based on our review of your submitted MBA application. Note that interview invitations may be extended at any time after you submit your reapplication, up until the date on which your admission decision is released.\nThe Tepper School of Business is proud to be a long-standing member of The Consortium. Applicants should submit their application via The Consortium application.\nThe mission of the Consortium for Graduate Study in Management, an alliance of more than 20 graduate business schools and some of our country’s top corporations, is to enhance diversity in business education and leadership by helping to reduce the under-representation of African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Native Americans in both its member schools’ enrollment and the ranks of management.\nThe Consortium fulfills its mission by attracting and recruiting qualified candidates from underrepresented groups, as well as other U.S. citizens or U.S. permanent residents who have demonstrated significant contributions to promoting diversity in the workplace.\nTepper's supplemental application includes one essay (maximum 500 words). You are now able to choose which essay question resonates most with you and how you can present your best application. Please choose 1 of the following 2 questions. We do not have a preference on which question you answer. Here are the 2 options:\nFor Consortium questions or to schedule an informational meeting, please contact Tony Gomez, Senior Associate Director of Masters Admissions.\nWe welcome applicants from around the globe and encourage non-U.S. citizens to apply to the Tepper School MBA program.\nReview our information for international applicants to learn more about certification of financial resources and visa regulations.\n• University Transcripts: All transcripts are copies of actual university transcripts (not web transcripts), usually on watermarked paper with a seal, etc.\n• Degree Name: If you earned a degree, the name is on the transcript (i.e. Bachelor of Science, Master of Arts, etc.).\n• Degree Conferral Date: If you earned a degree, the date the degree was awarded is on the transcript.\n• Degree Certificate: If you earned a degree and the degree name/conferral date are not on the transcript, you must upload a copy of your degree certificate which includes this information.
