This option is only available after you have paid your application fee in full. Applicants who have applied for U.S. permanent residency but do not yet have the card in hand must apply to Texas McCombs as an international applicant. Should your card arrive after, you may notify the Office of Graduate Admissions to update your status.\nAll applicants are required to complete the video assessment.

Full-Time MBA releases decisions by round on the date listed. Working Professional and Executive MBA releases decisions 4-6 weeks after application submission.\nOnce a decision has been released on your application, you will receive an automated email to view your admissions decision. All admissions decisions are final for the application cycle.\nFor admitted students only: To safeguard the integrity of the admission process, Texas McCombs partners with Re Vera Services to conduct an employment and recommendation verification. If it is determined that there has been any misrepresentation in an applicant’s MBA application, McCombs reserves the right to rescind the offer of admission. There will be a required fee paid directly to Re Vera Services at a base price of $120 USD. The verification process must be completed by the deadline specified by the MBA program office.\nAll Evening MBA applicants are required to submit a GMAT, GMAT Focus, GRE, or Executive Assessment (EA) score.

To support you through the process, we offer a dedicated financial aid team who will help you explore ways to finance your degree. As the #1 ranked Full-Time MBA program in Texas and top-20 in the U.S., your degree will start paying dividends immediately.\nProgram Installments per Semester\nA non-refundable $2,000 deposit is required once an applicant accepts our offer of admission in order to secure a seat in the program. The deposit will be credited toward your first semester’s program costs. Payments for each semester’s tuition and fees are due approximately six weeks before each semester begins.\nAll Full-Time MBA students are required to pay a nonrefundable $1,200 student fee the summer before enrollment, which supports a variety of program and co-curricular resources throughout the program.\nThe tuition estimates above are based on expected enrollment in 15/14/15/15 hours for your first through fourth semester. However, your actual tuition will vary because it is billed according to how many total hours you are enrolled each semester. Current and archived tuition charts for both residents and non-residents can be found on  Texas One Stop  under the Professional section\nFor information on dual degree tuition rates, please see UT Austin Dual Degree Tuition information.\nCost of attendance ensures access to top-rated McCombs School of Business resources for students and world-class faculty.\nTexas state law classifies each person who applies for admission to a Texas public college or university as one of the following:\nStudents who are classified as Texas residents pay a discounted tuition rate and qualify to apply for financial aid awarded by the state.\nVisit UT Austin Admissions or contact the UT Residency Office for more information about residency.\nPlease note that your record will reflect that you are a non-resident until you are admitted to the program. You will then complete a survey to confirm your residency status.\nFirst Year Fall 2025 / Spring 2026\nThe estimated cost of attendance is determined by The Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid (OSFA) and used as a starter budget for graduate students to provide your initial financial aid offer.\nEach student applying for financial aid will be offered the same budget and the only differences in the amounts will be for tuition, which is based on residency, and international fees.\nGraduate students must be enrolled in at least 5 credit hours in the fall and spring to receive financial aid.\nCost Breakdown:\n*Cost per credit hours are not standardized and this estimate is based on taking a total of 29 hours your first year (15 hours in fall and 14 hours in spring) and is subject to change if you are taking more or fewer hours. Additionally, international students are charged non-resident tuition rates and will be subject to additional fees (see below) not included in the estimate above but will be included on the Tuition Bill.\n**Off-campus room and board costs breakdown: $1579.77 per month for rent/utilities/Internet and $342.50 per month based on USDA low-cost food plan monthly average. When calculating the nine months of the fall/spring, the result is $14218 and $3082 respectively.\n***Books & Supplies are based on enrollment at a multiple of $43 per credit hour. The estimate above is calculated based on taking a total of 29 hours in your first year (15 hours in fall and 14 hours in spring). This amount is subject to change if you are taking more or fewer hours.\nTexas McCombs Full-Time MBA students leverage a mix of federal loans, private loans, scholarships, employer benefits, and savings to finance their degree. Learn about different financial aid options to see which is right for you.\nIf you are a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, you will likely be eligible for federal student loans.\nTo determine your eligibility, you must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).\nOnce your FAFSA has been successfully processed, you will be offered enough federal loans up to the estimated Cost of Attendance (COA) for a Full-Time MBA student at 15 hours per semester. Additional loans can then be requested to help cover living costs and other educational expenses not already included in your program costs, which you can request by emailing the McCombs Financial Aid team.\nYou can check the status of your FAFSA after it has been submitted by visiting the ‘Status/Requirements’ page in your Check Aid Status Here (CASH) portal. The Financial Aid team will begin packaging McCombs students’ financial aid in late May/early June for the upcoming aid year.\nIf you do not receive a Financial Aid Notification (FAN) by the end of June, please contact us at FinancialAid@mccombs.utexas.edu.\nIf you choose to pursue a private loan, we recommend applying no sooner than a few months before the start of your program. Ethically, we cannot recommend a lender; you must do research to find lenders that meet your needs. Most private loans are credit-based, and the approval decision may expire. Check with your lender about the length of time your application will remain valid before you apply.\nWhen applying, you must use loan periods that match what is used by The Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid (OSFA) for processing loans. If your lender provides pre-selected loan periods, we recommend you contact the lender to get the loan periods on your application updated to match what UT Austin uses.\nYou can opt to apply for each semester individually or you can group fall and spring together. Please use the following loan periods as needed during your time in the program.\nPlease note: academic years cannot be grouped together, so you will have to apply for each year separately. For example, if you are in the class of 2027, you will apply for the academic year 2025-2026 before you begin the program and then during summer 2026 you will apply for 2026-2027.\nIf you have questions about the loan itself, contact your lender.\nIf you have an issue with the processing of your private loan, please email us at FinancialAid@mccombs.utexas.edu and include your UT EID and program in your email.\nThere are some loan options for international students. More favorable loan terms may be available if you have a U.S. citizen or permanent resident as a co-signer. There are a few lenders that do not require a U.S. co-signer for approval, but the loan terms are typically less preferable.\nThe University of Texas at Austin cannot co-sign on any loans, and as a public institution, we are unable to recommend any specific lenders. We advise searching online and speaking to current students or alumni to see what options may be available for your. Once you choose a lender, we are able to work with all banks and lending institutions to process your loan.\nHave you or your spouse been living and working in Texas for at least a year?\nIf so, it is possible that you could be considered an International Texas Resident. If you are able to establish domicile and be classified as a Texas Resident, you may have additional options to secure funding.\nAll Full-Time MBA applicants are considered for merit-based scholarship opportunities.\nAll Full-Time MBA applicants are considered for merit-based scholarships, regardless of their country of origin or citizenship.\nDuring the first year of the Full-Time MBA program, you may apply for a continuing student scholarship for your second year.

Intellectual curiosity, strategic problem-solving abilities, and a drive for success are essential traits.\nApplications for the Full-Time MBA program are accepted in three rounds, and the program enrolls annually every August.\nApplications must be submitted by 11:59 PM Central Time on the deadline date for each round.\nApplication Due: October 15, 2025Decision Delivered: December 16, 2025\nApplication Due: January 15, 2026Decision Delivered: March 26, 2026\nApplication Due: April 1, 2026Decision Delivered: May 7, 2026\nAll Full-Time MBA applicants are required to submit a GMAT, GMAT Focus, GRE, or Executive Assessment (EA) score. We will waive the testing requirement if:\nThe MBA Admissions Committee does not have a preference on which test you take, and there is no minimum score. You can review our Full-Time MBA class profile for test score averages. More details on how to submit test scores or petition for a test waiver can be found below.\nFor current scores (taken within 5 years), you must self-report your test scores in your application as well as have official score reports sent directly to UT Austin by the testing agency. The date that your official scores are sent to UT Austin by the testing agency should be no later than the application round deadline, as it can take up to four weeks for new scores to be processed.\nSchool codes for Texas McCombs MBA:\nFor expired test scores (taken 5+ years ago) you must self-report your score and upload proof of the test score in the application. Examples of proof for expired test scores include a score report you previously received from the testing agency OR documentation from another educational institution that previously received the score (e.g. for another graduate/terminal degree application).\nA merit-based test waiver is available by request prior to submitting your application. Waivers/Exceptions are not available for applicants who have already sent scores to UT.\nFull-Time MBA students who were admitted without a valid GRE, GMAT or EA score will be required to enroll in Accelerated Foundations Program, a one week quantitative prep series taught by McCombs faculty.\nMore information on criteria, instructions on how to submit, and other details can be found on our merit-based test waiver pdf.\nTOEFL or IELTS Waivers\nInternational applicants who meet one of the following criteria will be granted a TOEFL or IELTS waiver:\nIf you do not meet any of these conditions, you are required to submit the TOEFL or IELTS exam without exception. Waivers are processed 5-10 business days after application submission.\nYou must upload your transcripts twice during the application process. First, within the application, prior to paying the application fee. This copy will be sent to McCombs. After paying your application fee, you will be asked to upload your transcripts again. This copy will be sent to the Office of Graduate Admissions.\nPlease read these instructions prior to uploading your transcripts to the Office of Graduate Admissions.\nWithin your application, you will provide your professional resume. Typically, two years of full-time post-bachelor’s work experience (not internships) are required for admission. Full-time work experience is calculated up until the time of enrollment (the start of classes). This encompasses all work completed since your bachelor’s degree, including teaching, military service, and government experience (e.g. the Peace Corps).

In line with our school mission and values, we are introducing a dynamic video assessment component, offering an alternative approach to a more traditional essay and interview format. Given all applicants will complete the video assessment, MBA candidates will have increased access to the Admissions Committee and the opportunity to share their stories with us in their own voice.  Through the video assessment, the Admissions Committee will have a chance to experience the “real” you, beyond a resume, test scores, and transcripts. Lastly, the video assessment will enable Texas McCombs to reduce bias in the admissions process by providing all applicants with a structured and consistent assessment experience.\nAll applicants will be required to complete the Video Assessment shortly after submitting an application. Applicants have 7 days to complete the assessment upon receiving access to the video submission platform. \nThere will be 5 question prompts and applicants will have 1-3 minutes to answer each prompt.\n\nMBA Interview\n\nOne of the most vital parts of the MBA application process at Texas McCombs is the human component – “Human-Centered, Future-Focused” is our mantra for a reason. We pride ourselves in getting to know you at a personal level during the admissions process and will continue to provide virtual and in-person events for you to meet our students, alumni, faculty, and admissions team.\nWe invite all MBA applicants to close out their application process in a human-centered way and complete a virtual interview. \nAll Full-Time MBA applicants are encouraged but not required to complete a virtual interview with a member of the McCombs Ambassador Committee. The interview format is behavioral-question based and lasts 20-30 minutes including time for your questions.  \nThese interactive virtual sessions present a valuable opportunity for our applicants to connect with the MBA community, showcase their collaborative skills, reaffirm their motivation for pursuing an MBA, and leave a lasting positive impression on Texas McCombs.\n[GRID_TABLE]\nMBA Test Options & WaiversMBA Test Options & WaiversMBA candidates have several options when considering how to complete the standardized test requirement in their application.

While pioneered within the consumer packaged goods industry, brand and product management has become a critical component of almost every company’s competitive strategy.\nBrand and product management jobs often entail running multi-million-dollar product businesses and hence provide excellent opportunities for those interested in general business and entrepreneurship.

Students who concentrate in Entrepreneurship benefit from many of the unique resources of the McCombs School of Business and the Austin community including:\n\nThe Herb Kelleher Center for Entrepreneurship, dedicated to funding teaching, research, and community outreach related to entrepreneurship.\nThe Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst Center for Private Equity Finance, fostering research and scholarship on issues related to private equity finance, capital markets, corporate finance, investments, real estate, and other associated matters.\nIC2 Institute / Austin Technology Incubator, an international think-tank for entrepreneurship.

It provides a comprehensive overview of the field, offering valuable insights without the commitment of launching your own business during the program.\nCareer Opportunities\n\nProduct Manager or Marketer\nSmall Business Manager\nVenture Capital Associate\nGeneral Manager\nInternal Strategist\nNew Venture Founder\nHealthcare\nThe Texas full-time MBA Healthcare concentration focuses on healthcare innovation, analytics, and technology ecosystem, with classes taught by award-winning Texas McCombs faculty.

As brand management skills have become critical in the more central marketing strategy efforts of many leading organizations, brand management is increasingly a route to CEO positions.\nRecommended Curriculum\n\nMKT 282 – Analysis of Markets (custom core)\nMKT 382 – Product Management\nMKT 382 – Strategic Branding\nMKT 382 – Digital Marketing\nMKT 382 – Strategic Marketing\nMKT 382 – Sales Management\nMKT 382 – Customer Strategy (Marketing Fellows)\n\n\nData Analysis – Choose one (1) course from the list below:\n\nMKT 382 – Data-Driven Marketing\nMKT 382 – Data Analytics & Dynamic Pricing\nMKT 382 – CRM & Database Management\n\n \n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding Customers – Choose one (1) course from the list below:\n\nMKT 382 – Consumer Behavior in a Digital World\nMKT 382 – Design Thinking For Business Innovation\n\n \nSTEM Designation Requirement:\nStudents who complete core courses plus the two custom core classes below meet the Management Sciences/Quantitative Methods STEM designation requirement.\n\nMKT 282 Analysis of Markets (required)\nSTA 287 Business Analytics\nAn approved elective may also be considered for the STEM designation requirement\nUnderstanding Customers – Choose one (1) course from the list below:\n\nMKT 382 – Consumer Behavior in a Digital World\nMKT 382 – Design Thinking For Business Innovation\n\n \nSTEM Designation Requirement:\nStudents who complete core courses plus the two custom core classes below meet the Management Sciences/Quantitative Methods STEM designation requirement.\n\nMKT 282 Analysis of Markets (required)\nSTA 287 Business Analytics\nAn approved elective may also be considered for the STEM designation requirement\nUnderstanding Customers – Choose one (1) course from the list below:\n\nMKT 382 – Consumer Behavior in a Digital World\nMKT 382 – Design Thinking For Business Innovation\n\n \nSTEM Designation Requirement:\nStudents who complete core courses plus the two custom core classes below meet the Management Sciences/Quantitative Methods STEM designation requirement.\n\nMKT 282 Analysis of Markets (required)\nSTA 287 Business Analytics\nAn approved elective may also be considered for the STEM designation requirement\nUnderstanding Customers – Choose one (1) course from the list below:\n\nMKT 382 – Consumer Behavior in a Digital World\nMKT 382 – Design Thinking For Business Innovation\n\n \nSTEM Designation Requirement:\nStudents who complete core courses plus the two custom core classes below meet the Management Sciences/Quantitative Methods STEM designation requirement.\n\nMKT 282 Analysis of Markets (required)\nSTA 287 Business Analytics\nAn approved elective may also be considered for the STEM designation requirement\nMarketing Analytics & Consulting\nThe marketing analytics track aims to provide the knowledge and skills that drive success in today’s rapidly evolving, data-focused business environment.

industries are very dynamic with rapid and discontinuous change being more the norm than the exception. Accordingly, marketers must successfully manage rapid new product introductions, often while simultaneously guiding the phase-out of other products within the same product line. In this regard, marketers’ greatest value lies in shaping the technological products produced by the firm into solutions that truly benefit potential customers and are differentiated from the rapidly proliferating competition.\nAt the same time, high-technology marketers engage in the classic marketing activities of segmentation, targeting, positioning, and ongoing marketing support for the rest of the firm’s products. In some industries, high-technology marketing resembles consulting and some companies may have such internal consulting business units (3M, for example).\nRecommended Curriculum\n\nMKT 282 – Analysis of Markets (custom core)\nMKT 382 – Product Management\nMKT 382 – Strategic Branding\nMKT 382 – Digital Marketing\nMKT 382 – Strategic Marketing\nMKT 382 – Consumer Behavior in a Digital World\nMKT 382 – Design Thinking For Business Innovation\nMKT 382 – Customer Strategy (Marketing Fellows)\n\n\nData Analysis – Choose one (1) or more courses from the list below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMKT 382 – Data-Driven Marketing\nMKT 382 – Data Analytics & Dynamic Pricing\nMKT 382 – CRM & Database Management\n\n\nSTEM Designation Requirement:\nStudents who complete core courses plus the two custom core classes below meet the Management Sciences/Quantitative Methods STEM designation requirement.\n\nMKT 282 Analysis of Markets (required)\nSTA 287 Business Analytics\nAn approved elective may also be considered for the STEM designation requirement\nMKT 382 – Data-Driven Marketing\nMKT 382 – Data Analytics & Dynamic Pricing\nMKT 382 – CRM & Database Management\n\n\nSTEM Designation Requirement:\nStudents who complete core courses plus the two custom core classes below meet the Management Sciences/Quantitative Methods STEM designation requirement.\n\nMKT 282 Analysis of Markets (required)\nSTA 287 Business Analytics\nAn approved elective may also be considered for the STEM designation requirement\nMKT 382 – Data-Driven Marketing\nMKT 382 – Data Analytics & Dynamic Pricing\nMKT 382 – CRM & Database Management\n\n\nSTEM Designation Requirement:\nStudents who complete core courses plus the two custom core classes below meet the Management Sciences/Quantitative Methods STEM designation requirement.\n\nMKT 282 Analysis of Markets (required)\nSTA 287 Business Analytics\nAn approved elective may also be considered for the STEM designation requirement\nMKT 382 – Data-Driven Marketing\nMKT 382 – Data Analytics & Dynamic Pricing\nMKT 382 – CRM & Database Management\n\n\nSTEM Designation Requirement:\nStudents who complete core courses plus the two custom core classes below meet the Management Sciences/Quantitative Methods STEM designation requirement.\n\nMKT 282 Analysis of Markets (required)\nSTA 287 Business Analytics\nAn approved elective may also be considered for the STEM designation requirement\n[GRID_TABLE]\nMKT 382 – Data-Driven Marketing\nMKT 382 – Data Analytics & Dynamic Pricing\nMKT 382 – CRM & Database Management\n\n\nSTEM Designation Requirement:\nStudents who complete core courses plus the two custom core classes below meet the Management Sciences/Quantitative Methods STEM designation requirement.\n\nMKT 282 Analysis of Markets (required)\nSTA 287 Business Analytics\nAn approved elective may also be considered for the STEM designation requirement\nMKT 382 – Data-Driven Marketing\nMKT 382 – Data Analytics & Dynamic Pricing\nMKT 382 – CRM & Database Management\n\n\nSTEM Designation Requirement:\nStudents who complete core courses plus the two custom core classes below meet the Management Sciences/Quantitative Methods STEM designation requirement.\n\nMKT 282 Analysis of Markets (required)\nSTA 287 Business Analytics\nAn approved elective may also be considered for the STEM designation requirement\n[GRID_TABLE]\nBusiness Analytics\nThe Business Analytics concentration is designed to cater to the growing demand for talent for managing, analyzing, predicting, and discovering insights from massive amounts of complex data (e.g., transactions, social networks, sensors, etc.) to solve business, social, and economic problems.
