You’ll graduate with the knowledge to set yourself apart in the competitive job market. Become a global entrepreneur and leader, confident to handle challenges in global defence and space contexts.  \nYou’ll also engage with a diverse global network of experienced industry professionals throughout your degree. Be poised to harness your connections and work collaboratively to shape the future of your industry.\nGraduates of this program can excel as leaders in industry across senior management and leadership roles. Your comprehensive knowledge of defence and space sector developments might be applied to roles in cybersecurity, space systems, space operations, geopolitics, defence procurement and more. \nIndustry trends \nAustralia, the United Kingdom and the United States have recently reached a significant milestone in our AUKUS agreement. The UK and US will now cooperate with Australia in safely building, operating and maintaining a conventionally-armed, nuclear-powered submarine capability. Future SSN-AUKUS submarines will be built at Osborne in South Australia (Australian Government Defence, 2024).  \nAccording to the Australian Institute of International Affairs (2024), ‘Australia’s space industry has A$2 billion in planned capital investments [with a commitment] to invest A$7 billion over the next decade in the Defence Department’s space capabilities.'\nGraduate from your Adelaide University degree with the global leadership skills needed to contribute to these expanding industries.\nCheck your eligibility\n    \nBefore you begin, find the degree you wish to study and

To find out more about document certification, contact us.\n[CARD]\nBefore you apply, it’s a good idea to familiarise yourself with the application closing date for your chosen degree. \nPlease note some degrees have different application deadlines. We recommend you check the specific deadline for your chosen degree on the program page.\n[CARD]\nIt’s important to make sure you understand the eligibility criteria and entry requirements for your chosen degree.

They will be able to analyse and articulate their place in this enterprise (and that of their organisations) and understand how to effectively manage and deliver capability programmes within defence. This course will introduce the components and complexities of the international defence enterprise. Conceptualising defence as a broad public-private partnership involving governments, militaries, industries, civil society, third sector actors, professional services and intelligentsia, we will explore the multiple, and often contradictory, drivers of the defence sector, revealing insights, understandings and critiques of how defence capabilities are generated from within this complicated and amorphous ecosystem. In particular, we will focus upon: the roles of governments and militaries in articulating military user requirements;the roles of commercial entities in meeting those requirements through financing, research and development, test and evaluation, manufacturing, systems' integration and mission support;the speed and challenges of technological advancement, disruption and assurance;sovereignty, notions of economic value, system and societal resilience. We will apply systems' thinking to the defence enterprise, considering the building blocks of defence capabilities, how these components are originated and where they reside within defence capability architectures. Within a fluid defence enterprise, the importance of constant analysis will be considered and conceptualised as knowledge management for informed decision-making. Students will learn how to summarize the key elements of the defence enterprise and review the methods, tools and techniques for managing the generation of defence capabilities. Students will be able to scrutinize, analyse and evaluate the condition of the defence enterprise, and its respective components, on completion of the course.\nLearning Journal, Report\n• Understand and articulate the key components of the defence enterprise.\n• Describe and review the measures and techniques available to manage the generation of defence capabilities within the enterprise.\n• Critically reflect upon and analyse the condition of the defence enterprise, its vulnerabilities, issues, risks and opportunities.\n[GRID_TABLE]\nDelivering Complex Programs\n    \n\n\n\nPostgraduate | 2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse information\n\n\n\n\nCurrent student enquiry\n\n\n\n\n\nFuture student enquiry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArea/Catalogue\n\nBUSI 5057\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse ID\n\n203164\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel of study\n\nPostgraduate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnit value\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse level\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInbound study abroad and exchange\nMore info\n\n\n\nInbound study abroad and exchange\n\n\n\nThe fee you pay will depend on the number and type of courses you study.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity-wide elective course\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSingle course enrolment\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n\n                        Course data is interim and subject to change\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Course overview\n                \n\nThe aim of this course is to conceive of the defence sector as a complex enterprise comprising multiple components and actors.

They will be able to analyse and articulate their place in this enterprise (and that of their organisations) and understand how to effectively manage and deliver capability programmes within defence. This course will introduce the components and complexities of the international defence enterprise. Conceptualising defence as a broad public-private partnership involving governments, militaries, industries, civil society, third sector actors, professional services and intelligentsia, we will explore the multiple, and often contradictory, drivers of the defence sector, revealing insights, understandings and critiques of how defence capabilities are generated from within this complicated and amorphous ecosystem. In particular, we will focus upon: the roles of governments and militaries in articulating military user requirements;the roles of commercial entities in meeting those requirements through financing, research and development, test and evaluation, manufacturing, systems' integration and mission support;the speed and challenges of technological advancement, disruption and assurance;sovereignty, notions of economic value, system and societal resilience. We will apply systems' thinking to the defence enterprise, considering the building blocks of defence capabilities, how these components are originated and where they reside within defence capability architectures.

The minimum English language requirement for entry to an Adelaide University undergraduate program is an International English Language Testing System (IELTS) Academic overall score of 6.0 or equivalent. However, English language entry requirements are degree specific, and some degrees have higher English language requirements. This means the exact requirement will depend upon the degree you are applying to.
