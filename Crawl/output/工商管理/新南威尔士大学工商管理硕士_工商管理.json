Satisfactory completion of an M.B.A or equivalent degree program is requisite for admission to the M.A.M. program. A student may also be admitted if the student has completed the required core curriculum of an M.B.A. or equivalent degree program—provided the M.B.A. or equivalent degree-granting school will count credit earned during the M.A.M. at Yale toward the M.B.A. or equivalent degree, thus enabling the student to earn the M.B.A. or equivalent degree prior to earning the M.A.M. The M.A.M. degree will be conferred only after Yale SOM receives confirmation from the M.B.A. institution that the student has completed all M.B.A. or equivalent degree requirements or is only missing the presentation of the final thesis. Yale SOM will have the prerogative to rescind the conferred M.A.M. degree if the student fails to submit, present, and pass the final thesis of their M.B.A. degree in due time.\nThe program, established in 2012, requires a year of full-time study in residence, during which the student completes 40 units of course work (the equivalent of ten term-long classes).\nOf the 40 units of course work, 36 units are chosen from the elective offerings listed in School of Management Courses for 2024–2025 or from approved offerings in other Yale schools and departments. An additional 4 units of course work comprise the required M.A.M. curriculum.\nTo learn more about the Master of Advanced Management program, visit https://som.yale.edu/mam.\nThe M.A.M. must be completed in two consecutive terms of full-time study, unless a student receives advance permission from the dean of students to take a leave of absence (see Leaves of Absence in the chapter General Information).

Reported on transcript.\nH: Honors Next 25 percent. Reported on transcript.\nPR: Proficient Next 55 percent.

The failed required course is not reflected on the official transcript until remediated. Elective courses with F grades are not reflected on the official transcript. Students must replace failed electives with other electives to meet total credit requirements for graduation.\nA student who fails a required course must remediate the failing grade through an alternate activity as specified by the instructor and the dean of students. In no case will a grade higher than Pass be recorded when a failed required course is remediated. A student is required to remediate failing grades in all required courses to graduate from the program.\nThe Management Science major is a general program focusing on the application of statistical modeling, data warehousing/mining, programming, forecasting, and operations research techniques to the analysis of problems of business organization and performance.\nM.B.A., M.A.M., and M.M.S. in Global Business and Society students at the Yale School of Management may pursue an optional major in Management Science drawing on Yale SOM faculty’s broad expertise in applying quantitative methods to challenges in business and management. Students will earn the major by completing a minimum of 16 units of eligible courses. For M.B.A. students, 6 units of the requirement will come from the M.B.A. core. An M.B.A. student exempting out of one or more core courses must make up the exempted credits from electives courses. Students may apply one non-SOM course (4 units) toward the Management Science major from the list of eligible courses.\nInternational students who pursue the Management Science major will have the opportunity to qualify for an additional two-year STEM extension of the Post-Completion OPT work permission. Students wishing to declare the Management Science major must do so in their application. Further information about eligibility and requirements for the STEM OPT extension is available through Yale’s Office of International Students and Scholars (https://oiss.yale.edu).\nApplication to the M.A.M. program is conducted electronically.
