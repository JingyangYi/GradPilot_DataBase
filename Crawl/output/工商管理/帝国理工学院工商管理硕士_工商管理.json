Digitisation is transforming the way businesses operate and reshaping the rules of work. Business leaders need to understand the change technology brings and have the agility, skills, and confidence to navigate through this ever-evolving environment.\nThe Imperial Full-Time MBA will challenge you to imagine, innovate, and inspire. It will allow you to develop the skills demanded by recruiters for the future workplace, enabling you find innovative solutions and create impact in business and society.\nWe are always looking forward, and our recently redesigned programme boasts a curriculum that enables you to customise your learning experience to your career goals, gain international business acumen, and accelerate your responsible leadership aptitude.\nAn MBA is an investment in you. Your education. Your career. Your future.\nYou also have the option to complete a four-six month work placement (internship) as part of your programme, extending the programme to 16 months and graduating with 120 ECTS. Please note that additional tuition fees apply.\nThis page is updated regularly to reflect the latest version of the curriculum. However, this information is subject to change.\nFind out more about potential course changes.\nPlease note: it may not always be possible to take specific combinations of modules due to timetabling conflicts. For confirmation, please check with the relevant department.\nThe Full-Time MBA begins with pre-study modules. These primers are designed to ensure you are prepared for your core modules at the start of your programme, where you will develop a deep understanding of the fundamental areas of business.\nThe core modules build rapidly on your previous experience, while introducing new and challenging disciplines. You will explore advanced business topics to build a solid toolkit and acquire the skills to be an effective and inspiring leader in your chosen career path.\nThe leadership experience forms an essential part of your MBA and is key in preparing you to capitalise on the many opportunities that await you upon graduation. Your own personal careers consultant will be with you from the start, supporting you in the development of your career strategy and preparing you for success in your leadership transformation.\nYou will begin your journey of customisation with two flexcore modules. This will enable you to choose a variety of modules to stay on a general management path, or alternatively to study one of our newly developed specialisms in analytics, entrepreneurship or finance.\nThe three concentration areas are aligned to Imperial’s research and faculty strength in these topics and reflect the key skills top employers are looking for in MBA graduates.\nIn addition to the fundamentals of data, probability and statistical analysis​, explore how AI and machine learning are reshaping our ability to leverage data and tackle real-life challenges. This specialism is for anyone with an analytical mind and passion for data looking to be at the forefront of this rapidly evolving subject.\nThis concentration is designed for those seeking roles in technology companies as well as any organisations engaged in digital transformation of their products, services, and processes. Elective options range from AI ventures and digital business model design and digital transformation.\nIn addition to the support available to students via the Imperial Enterprise Lab, you’ll discover the true meaning of innovation and how to solve complex problems with a disruptive mindset. This specialism is designed to give you the tools, support, and expertise to successfully launch your own venture or innovate from within and create change in your future organisations.\nThis concentration offers a deep dive into the mindset, knowledge, and skills for leading and transforming organisations towards greater sustainability and stakeholder impact. You may take this concentration if you are aiming for one of the growing number of specialist roles that corporations, consultancies, NGOs and governments offer in this area.\nElectives include sustainable strategy, ESG-related finance, sustainable and social innovation, sustainable consumption, and energy business.\nIf you are looking to work in financial services, corporate finance or fintech, take the finance specialism. Access the Finance Lab, attend seminars with executives from leading financial services firms and start-up innovators and visit companies to see finance in action and develop your network.\nYour next step is to choose from a wide range of electives, where you will continue to explore your own areas of interest. You can choose from traditional business topics such as marketing and strategy, or study electives that are unique to Imperial and our STEM expertise in areas including climate change, energy business, sustainability, AI, machine learning and more. If you’ve decided to pursue a specialism, you will choose your electives according to your chosen route.\nWe’ll support your development as a leader by helping you understand how your awareness of ethical, societal, and diversity issues, as well as your own leadership style, play a role in every decision you make.\nThe world needs responsible leaders who care about the long-term health of their organisations but also society and the environment. Using a holistic approach, our LEADS module runs all year and starts with giving you the tools to discover and analyse yourself.\nYou will move on to consider yourself in relation to others, and finally, explore the role of leaders in making organisations sustainable.\nThe Personal Leadership Journey is a Careers-led module that runs throughout the programme. It is designed to give you the key skills you need as a global professional through workshops, reflective exercises and one-to-one meetings. It will also enable you to make new connections with leaders and experts from the industries that most interest you.\nWorking closely with your own personal careers consultant throughout the year, you’ll focus on four key areas including: Personal impact and networking, Executive communication, Managing your career, and Leading in a complex and connected world.\nIn order to make an impact on a global scale, you must understand the global environment in which you are working. As an MBA student, you will have opportunities to travel to international destinations to study at partner schools and work with local businesses.\nLearn about the challenges faced by local organisations, and how a country’s business environment affects the way organisations operate. You will be fully immersed into the business operations of a startup or small or medium sized enterprise (SME) and will be able to put into practice skills acquired in the classroom to create real-life results.\nThis is an integral part of the Full-Time MBA programme, with costs included in your tuition fees.\nThe IB Glocal Electives, which are shared across the MBA portfolio, teach students how to explore contemporary global business problems with a local perspective.\nOur optional Global Exchanges programme allows you to increase your international exposure and build your network by taking advantage of specialised electives at one of our partner schools.\nAt Imperial we provide immersive opportunities to explore real-world business challenges, developing a global mindset and hands-on skills, you’ll strengthen your understanding of business, innovation and responsible leadership.\nWorking in groups, you will use business model innovation to create economic disruption with positive environmental and social effects. Through this one-week learning laboratory, you will apply innovative thinking to complex international issues and generate business solutions.\nIn your summer term, you will be tasked to integrate and synthesise the theory you’ve learned in the classroom, together with insights from your business experience, and apply it in a real-world setting through either an Internship or Individual Project.\nWith tailored support and feedback, Careers Week enables you to focus on your career goals through a series of workshops and activities. Highlights of the week include: tailored career sessions, drop-ins for sector-specific career guidance, Entrepreneurs Day co-delivered by the Imperial Enterprise Lab and Imperial Hackspace, interview practice and feedback, and external one-to-ones for specific sectors\nYou have the option to attend a speaker series with industry leaders, as well as intimate seminars with Imperial College London experts from fields including climate change, AI and fintech.\nYour MBA will culminate in an unforgettable capstone experience away from campus in a natural environment to give you the space to reflect upon your learning experience. In previous years, students visited a national park in Wales with their classmates while the class of 2022/23 visited Norway.\nThe Entrepreneurial Journey is your opportunity to work an idea into a product or service and pitch your proposition to a panel of venture capitalists to compete for a monetary prize. You can connect with Imperial scientists if your idea is tech-related.\nThe Strategic Consulting Project (SCP) module provides you the opportunity to work on a real-world business problem for a real client in a team setting. This will allow you to apply the knowledge you gained in the Business Problem Solving module, your other core modules (depending on the topic you are addressing), and your skill in working as part of a team which is supported by a faculty coach.\nGain practical experience in developing business/data analytics applications for business with our MBA Analytics Project. Work part-time in small groups over an approximately 10-week period to complete a business-related project which contains a significant analytics component.\nWorking either individually or in a team of two people (your choice), you will address an important, real-life problem, opportunity or challenge within a finance firm that is amenable to an approach based on data gathering and analysis. Teams will prepare a formal written proposal and communicate their results via both presentation and written report.\nThe Business Project allows you to develop your ideas on a particular topic of interest.\nIf you wish to take a longer (four-six month) internship as part of your programme, you can take an extended work placement with the approval of the Academic Director.\nThis is particularly relevant for (but not exclusive to) internships in France, Germany, and other European countries that require students to have student status for the duration of their internships.

In most cases, you will have applied to Imperial well in advance of the start of the course, and our courses run over several years. It is not desirable and can be very difficult to fix all aspects of course delivery so far in advance.\nOne of the particular features of life at Imperial is that our courses are designed to be dynamic and responsive. We also encourage our academics to deliver courses in a manner which reflects their individual style and expertise, consistent with offering a world leading education.\nThis webpage details the limited circumstances in which we may need to make changes to or in relation to our courses, the type of changes we may make and how we will tell you about changes we have made.\nBelow we have set out the types of changes we may need to make to our courses, examples of those changes, and the reasons why we may need to make those changes.\nChanges which go to the heart of the educational experience you receive or which are significantly different to what you were told and what you would have expected when you accepted your place.\nFor legal or regulatory reasons, if there is a compelling academic need to make the change or because we otherwise think the change is necessary and in Imperial’s and/or your best interests.\nChanges which are part of the flexibility inherent to our courses, and which do not go to the heart of the educational experience you will receive; the course will not be significantly different from what you were told or what you would have expected.\nIn addition, to review and enhance the course as part of the College’s normal processes, to improve the services we offer or to operate efficiently.\nWe may need to make changes to our courses before you have accepted your place, after you have accepted your place, and once you have started studying on your course.\nHow we will communicate those changes to you and what course of action is open to you will depend on where you are in the application journey or whether you have already started your course of study.\nInformation in our prospectus and on our website is up to date when it is published, and is designed to be relevant to applicants who are then in the process of applying to study on the course.\nAs explained above, we may need to make certain changes to or in relation to our courses. If we do so, we will try to draw them to your attention, but we are not always aware who will have seen our prospectus or visited our website. As a result, we recommend you check the relevant course pages before finalising your application to ensure no changes have been made.\nIf we have to make any changes after you have been made an offer but before you start on the course, we will provide information on these within the relevant course pages.\nAs part of your preparations for starting at the College, you should regularly check the relevant course pages.\nIn the case of any major change, we will offer you the chance to withdraw from the course if you are unhappy about that change.\nIf you have any questions about changes that have been made to a course that you are holding an offer for, please contact the relevant department to discuss these changes and how they might affect your learning experience.\nIt is unlikely we will make major changes to your course once you have started studying however these types of changes are not always avoidable.\nExceptions include:\nWe will always do what we can to minimise any disruption or inconvenience to you.\nIn the event we have to make a major change, we will:\nIf you are unhappy with the major change, we will try to find a solution you are happy with and will support you, for example by offering you the right to withdraw without penalty, refunding your tuition fees, or allowing you to transfer to a different course.\nMinor changes will take place as part of the natural lifecycle of a course and many are inherent to the successful operation of the courses we offer. They are often unavoidable, for example, when a member of staff leaves. You are therefore expected to adopt a cooperative and flexible approach.\nYou will be told about minor changes which affect your course, but you will not be offered the right to withdraw, a refund, or the right to transfer to a different course as a result of a minor change.\n• Imperial Home\n• Study\n• Apply\n• Course changes\n• Course pages\n• Major changes\n• Minor changes\n• Changes to the course title\n• Changes to the award\n• Significant restructuring of the course\n• Substantial changes in course content\n• Changes to the progression rules\n• Changes to the status of a course (e.g. to accreditation status)\n• Fundamental changes to the learning and teaching strategy (e.g. changing the method of delivery from face-to-face to distance learning)\n• Changes to the primary campus location\n• Suspension or discontinuation of core modules\n• Discontinuation of elective modules\n• Suspension or discontinuation of the course\n• Change of lecturer or other staff\n• Changes to individual module titles\n• Revisions to the content of individual modules to reflect development within the academic discipline and current affairs\n• Changes to enhance the delivery or assessment methods of individual modules\n• Timetabling changes\n• Incidental changes to our facilities\n• Temporary suspension of elective modules\n• Changes after publication of course information, before you apply\n• Changes after you have been made an offer but before you start on the course\n• Major changes once you have started studying on your course\n• Minor changes once you have started studying on your course\n• where we are affected by an event outside of our control\n• where you resit or repeat a year so that you do not complete your studies as expected\n• where we are not able to teach-out the course as planned\n• consult you in advance\n• listen to your views\n• seek your agreement\n[CARD]\nWhat we consider to be a major change\nChanges which go to the heart of the educational experience you receive or which are significantly different to what you were told and what you would have expected when you accepted your place.\nWhy we may need to make major changes\nFor legal or regulatory reasons, if there is a compelling academic need to make the change or because we otherwise think the change is necessary and in Imperial’s and/or your best interests.\nExamples of major changes\n\nChanges to the course title\nChanges to the award\nSignificant restructuring of the course\nSubstantial changes in course content\nChanges to the progression rules\nChanges to the status of a course (e.g. to accreditation status)\nFundamental changes to the learning and teaching strategy (e.g. changing the method of delivery from face-to-face to distance learning)\nChanges to the primary campus location\nSuspension or discontinuation of core modules\nDiscontinuation of elective modules\nSuspension or discontinuation of the course\n[CARD]\nWhat we consider to be a minor change\nChanges which are part of the flexibility inherent to our courses, and which do not go to the heart of the educational experience you will receive; the course will not be significantly different from what you were told or what you would have expected.\nWhy we may need to make minor changes\nFor legal or regulatory reasons, if there is a compelling academic need to make the change or because we otherwise think the change is necessary and in Imperial’s and/or your best interests.\nIn addition, to review and enhance the course as part of the College’s normal processes, to improve the services we offer or to operate efficiently.\nExamples of minor changes\n\nChange of lecturer or other staff\nChanges to individual module titles\nRevisions to the content of individual modules to reflect development within the academic discipline and current affairs\nChanges to enhance the delivery or assessment methods of individual modules\nTimetabling changes\nIncidental changes to our facilities\nTemporary suspension of elective modules\n[CARD]\nInformation in our prospectus and on our website is up to date when it is published, and is designed to be relevant to applicants who are then in the process of applying to study on the course.\nAs explained above, we may need to make certain changes to or in relation to our courses.

Digitisation is transforming the way businesses operate and reshaping the rules of work. Business leaders need to understand the change technology brings and have the agility, skills, and confidence to navigate through this ever-evolving environment.\nThe Imperial Full-Time MBA will challenge you to imagine, innovate, and inspire. It will allow you to develop the skills demanded by recruiters for the future workplace, enabling you find innovative solutions and create impact in business and society.\nWe are always looking forward, and our recently redesigned programme boasts a curriculum that enables you to customise your learning experience to your career goals, gain international business acumen, and accelerate your responsible leadership aptitude.\nAn MBA is an investment in you. Your education. Your career. Your future.\nYou also have the option to complete a four-six month work placement (internship) as part of your programme, extending the programme to 16 months and graduating with 120 ECTS. Please note that additional tuition fees apply.\nThis page is updated regularly to reflect the latest version of the curriculum. However, this information is subject to change.\nFind out more about potential course changes.\nPlease note: it may not always be possible to take specific combinations of modules due to timetabling conflicts. For confirmation, please check with the relevant department.\nThe Full-Time MBA begins with pre-study modules. These primers are designed to ensure you are prepared for your core modules at the start of your programme, where you will develop a deep understanding of the fundamental areas of business.\nThe core modules build rapidly on your previous experience, while introducing new and challenging disciplines. You will explore advanced business topics to build a solid toolkit and acquire the skills to be an effective and inspiring leader in your chosen career path.\nThe leadership experience forms an essential part of your MBA and is key in preparing you to capitalise on the many opportunities that await you upon graduation. Your own personal careers consultant will be with you from the start, supporting you in the development of your career strategy and preparing you for success in your leadership transformation.\nYou will begin your journey of customisation with two flexcore modules. This will enable you to choose a variety of modules to stay on a general management path, or alternatively to study one of our newly developed specialisms in analytics, entrepreneurship or finance.\nThe three concentration areas are aligned to Imperial’s research and faculty strength in these topics and reflect the key skills top employers are looking for in MBA graduates.\nIn addition to the fundamentals of data, probability and statistical analysis​, explore how AI and machine learning are reshaping our ability to leverage data and tackle real-life challenges. This specialism is for anyone with an analytical mind and passion for data looking to be at the forefront of this rapidly evolving subject.\nThis concentration is designed for those seeking roles in technology companies as well as any organisations engaged in digital transformation of their products, services, and processes. Elective options range from AI ventures and digital business model design and digital transformation.\nIn addition to the support available to students via the Imperial Enterprise Lab, you’ll discover the true meaning of innovation and how to solve complex problems with a disruptive mindset. This specialism is designed to give you the tools, support, and expertise to successfully launch your own venture or innovate from within and create change in your future organisations.\nThis concentration offers a deep dive into the mindset, knowledge, and skills for leading and transforming organisations towards greater sustainability and stakeholder impact. You may take this concentration if you are aiming for one of the growing number of specialist roles that corporations, consultancies, NGOs and governments offer in this area.\nElectives include sustainable strategy, ESG-related finance, sustainable and social innovation, sustainable consumption, and energy business.\nIf you are looking to work in financial services, corporate finance or fintech, take the finance specialism. Access the Finance Lab, attend seminars with executives from leading financial services firms and start-up innovators and visit companies to see finance in action and develop your network.\nYour next step is to choose from a wide range of electives, where you will continue to explore your own areas of interest. You can choose from traditional business topics such as marketing and strategy, or study electives that are unique to Imperial and our STEM expertise in areas including climate change, energy business, sustainability, AI, machine learning and more. If you’ve decided to pursue a specialism, you will choose your electives according to your chosen route.\nWe’ll support your development as a leader by helping you understand how your awareness of ethical, societal, and diversity issues, as well as your own leadership style, play a role in every decision you make.\nThe world needs responsible leaders who care about the long-term health of their organisations but also society and the environment. Using a holistic approach, our LEADS module runs all year and starts with giving you the tools to discover and analyse yourself.\nYou will move on to consider yourself in relation to others, and finally, explore the role of leaders in making organisations sustainable.\nThe Personal Leadership Journey is a Careers-led module that runs throughout the programme. It is designed to give you the key skills you need as a global professional through workshops, reflective exercises and one-to-one meetings. It will also enable you to make new connections with leaders and experts from the industries that most interest you.\nWorking closely with your own personal careers consultant throughout the year, you’ll focus on four key areas including: Personal impact and networking, Executive communication, Managing your career, and Leading in a complex and connected world.\nIn order to make an impact on a global scale, you must understand the global environment in which you are working. As an MBA student, you will have opportunities to travel to international destinations to study at partner schools and work with local businesses.\nLearn about the challenges faced by local organisations, and how a country’s business environment affects the way organisations operate. You will be fully immersed into the business operations of a startup or small or medium sized enterprise (SME) and will be able to put into practice skills acquired in the classroom to create real-life results.\nThis is an integral part of the Full-Time MBA programme, with costs included in your tuition fees.\nThe IB Glocal Electives, which are shared across the MBA portfolio, teach students how to explore contemporary global business problems with a local perspective.\nOur optional Global Exchanges programme allows you to increase your international exposure and build your network by taking advantage of specialised electives at one of our partner schools.\nAt Imperial we provide immersive opportunities to explore real-world business challenges, developing a global mindset and hands-on skills, you’ll strengthen your understanding of business, innovation and responsible leadership.\nWorking in groups, you will use business model innovation to create economic disruption with positive environmental and social effects. Through this one-week learning laboratory, you will apply innovative thinking to complex international issues and generate business solutions.\nIn your summer term, you will be tasked to integrate and synthesise the theory you’ve learned in the classroom, together with insights from your business experience, and apply it in a real-world setting through either an Internship or Individual Project.\nWith tailored support and feedback, Careers Week enables you to focus on your career goals through a series of workshops and activities. Highlights of the week include: tailored career sessions, drop-ins for sector-specific career guidance, Entrepreneurs Day co-delivered by the Imperial Enterprise Lab and Imperial Hackspace, interview practice and feedback, and external one-to-ones for specific sectors\nYou have the option to attend a speaker series with industry leaders, as well as intimate seminars with Imperial College London experts from fields including climate change, AI and fintech.\nYour MBA will culminate in an unforgettable capstone experience away from campus in a natural environment to give you the space to reflect upon your learning experience. In previous years, students visited a national park in Wales with their classmates while the class of 2022/23 visited Norway.\nThe Entrepreneurial Journey is your opportunity to work an idea into a product or service and pitch your proposition to a panel of venture capitalists to compete for a monetary prize. You can connect with Imperial scientists if your idea is tech-related.\nThe Strategic Consulting Project (SCP) module provides you the opportunity to work on a real-world business problem for a real client in a team setting. This will allow you to apply the knowledge you gained in the Business Problem Solving module, your other core modules (depending on the topic you are addressing), and your skill in working as part of a team which is supported by a faculty coach.\nGain practical experience in developing business/data analytics applications for business with our MBA Analytics Project. Work part-time in small groups over an approximately 10-week period to complete a business-related project which contains a significant analytics component.\nWorking either individually or in a team of two people (your choice), you will address an important, real-life problem, opportunity or challenge within a finance firm that is amenable to an approach based on data gathering and analysis. Teams will prepare a formal written proposal and communicate their results via both presentation and written report.\nThe Business Project allows you to develop your ideas on a particular topic of interest.\nIf you wish to take a longer (four-six month) internship as part of your programme, you can take an extended work placement with the approval of the Academic Director.\nThis is particularly relevant for (but not exclusive to) internships in France, Germany, and other European countries that require students to have student status for the duration of their internships.
