Kong/China TrackThe full-time HKU Master of Business Administration (MBA) curriculum is designed to provide students with a first-class education, real-world experience, a deep understanding of Asia and international business, and a sincere appreciation of cultural differences.HKU MBA is ranked amongst the best in the world: For 10th time No. 1 in Asia ranked by The Economist. In the Financial Times (FT) Global MBA ranking 2023, HKU MBA is ranked No. 1 in Hong Kong and No. 41 in the world. In the Forbes Full-time MBA Rankings 2019: The Best International MBAs: One Year Programs, is ranked No. 13 and in Times Higher Education/Wall Street Journal ranked No.1 one year MBA in the world. Given the relatively short history of the full-time MBA programme at HKU, the HKU Business School's achievement of such high regional and world rankings is impressive indeed. The programme starts with an orientation programme and a series of networking events with their classmates and HKU alumni to create valuable, life-long connections. All students will then begin their nine-month course of study in Hong Kong, where they will take case-based foundational and functional core modules, along with electives to acquire more focused expertise on the subjects in which they have a keen interest. Throughout the 1-year journey, students will participate in a series of Executive Development Workshops created to encourage them to fully engage in a unique learning experience while sharpening their soft skills.Our unique China Immersion Programme provides the opportunity to learn about the vast diversity of China's economy as well as the cultural differences between China's north and south. Students will get to visit various cities in Mainland China to understand one of the biggest and most important economies in the world. At the same time they will be interacting with renowned companies in these cities, enabling them to expand their business networks and connections.In their final four months, students will complete the programme with elective subjects taken at London Business School (LBS), Columbia Business School (CBS), Fudan University or Hong Kong, depending on their chosen track.Part-time MBA - Weekday & Weekend / GBA modeThe part-time MBA programme follows the same rigorous core curriculum as the full-time programme, and students share the same world-class faculty.It is designed to help students comprehend, manage and capitalise on the region's dynamic and rapidly evolving business environment, while providing them with maximum flexibility to balance work-study life.The part-time MBA is offered both in weekday and weekend modes in Hong Kong, providing maximum flexibility to students eager to accelerate their careers. Students select courses in either the weekday or weekend mode for their core courses, and choose electives offered from a common pool consisting of weekday and weekend mode courses. A certain degree of flexibility between weekday and weekend mode courses (for example: weekday mode can choose 3-weekend core courses and the weekend mode can choose 3-weekday core courses).The part-time MBA (GBA mode) combines teaching resources in Shenzhen Centre and HKU Business School campuses, which is proposed for students to easily travel from major cities in Mainland China to Shenzhen and Hong Kong to attend classes. The courses are offered in a structure of 4 days (2 weekends) every 6 weeks, allowing students to concentrate on a single course and minimizing travelling.The degree can be completed in a minimum of two years and a maximum of four years. The programme's modular structure allows students to concentrate on one course at a time.\n\n\nEntrance Requirements\n\n1. A recognised Bachelor's degree or equivalent;2.
