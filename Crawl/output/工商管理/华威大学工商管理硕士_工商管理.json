For details on how to pay your fees, please see our Making Payments pages.\nPlease note future years’ tuition fees will be set via the University’s fee setting process in due course. The tuition fee payable for each subsequent year of your programme will increase annually by the relevant inflation, which has ranged 4% to 6% in the last few years. The University will, usually in October of each year, publish on this webpage the tuition fees for a further academic year. You are advised to check the website for further details of any increases in tuition fees. If you have any queries in relation to tuition fees for future years that are not listed on the webpage, please contact email studentfees at warwick dot ac dot uk in the first instance.\nSome courses will require a tuition fee deposit, see the Tuition Fee Deposit page for more information.\nFrom 2020-21 students from the Channel Isles or the Isle of Man are charged at the Home rate.\nSome of our courses have non-standard pricing structures or are structured by modules - the departments who do this are listed below.\nOtherwise you can search the course fees list - which is in alphabetical order - by entering a word / UCAS code in the search box.\nAccounting and Finance (MSc) (now closed)\nAdvanced Mechanical Engineering (MSc)\nFinancial Technology (MSc)\nFinancial Technology

the tuition fees for my course?\nTuition fees are payable for each year of your course at the start of the academic year, or at the start of your course, if later. For details on how to pay your fees, please see our Making Payments pages.\nPlease note future years’ tuition fees will be set via the University’s fee setting process in due course. The tuition fee payable for each subsequent year of your programme will increase annually by the relevant inflation, which has ranged 4% to 6% in the last few years. The University will, usually in October of each year, publish on this webpage the tuition fees for a further academic year. You are advised to check the website for further details of any increases in tuition fees. If you have any queries in relation to tuition fees for future years that are not listed on the webpage, please contact email studentfees at warwick dot ac dot uk in the first instance.\nSome courses will require a tuition fee deposit, see the Tuition Fee Deposit page for more information.\nFrom 2020-21 students from the Channel Isles or the Isle of Man are charged at the Home rate.\nHow to find your course fees\nSome of our courses have non-standard pricing structures or are structured by modules - the departments who do this are listed below.\nOtherwise you can search the course fees list -

course, if later. For details on how to pay your fees, please see our Making Payments pages.\nPlease note future years’ tuition fees will be set via the University’s fee setting process in due course. The tuition fee payable for each subsequent year of your programme will increase annually by the relevant inflation, which has ranged 4% to 6% in the last few years. The University will, usually in October of each year, publish on this webpage the tuition fees for a further academic year. You are advised to check the website for further details of any increases in tuition fees. If you have any queries in relation to tuition fees for future years that are not listed on the webpage, please contact email studentfees at warwick dot ac dot uk in the first instance.\nSome courses will require a tuition fee deposit, see the Tuition Fee Deposit page for more information.\nFrom 2020-21 students from the Channel Isles or the Isle of Man are charged at the Home rate.\nHow to find your course fees\nSome of our courses have non-standard pricing structures or are structured by modules - the departments who do this are listed below.\nOtherwise you can search the course fees list - which is in alphabetical order - by entering a word / UCAS code in the search box.\n\nCentre for Education Studies - Part-time modular programmes\nCentre for Lifelong Learning - Part-time modular programmes\nCentre for Teacher Education - Professional Education part-time\nDepartment of Economics - MRes Economics by Research\nWarwick Business School - Global Central Banking & Financial Regulation\nWarwick Business School - Global Online MBA\nWarwick Business School - Executive MBA\nWarwick Business School - Accelerator MBA\nWarwick Business School - Doctorate in Business Administration (DBA)\nWarwick Medical School\n[CARD]\nFull time\n[CARD]\nFull time\n[CARD]\nPart time",
