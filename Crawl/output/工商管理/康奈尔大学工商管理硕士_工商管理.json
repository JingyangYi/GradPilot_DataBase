Recruiters seek Johnson School MBAs because they find them exceptionally well-prepared and strong team players who begin making meaningful contributions to employers on day one. See our most recent employment data for more information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhy do you offer immersions in the first year instead of the second?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nOur immersions are a combination of specialized coursework and performance learning activities aimed at providing you with exceptional preparation for your summer internship. Building on the general management foundation of functional skills you gain through your core courses, these immersions give you specialized knowledge in a particular field. Companies consistently tell us that our interns are better able to make an immediate contribution than students from peer institutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCan I start my MBA in the spring semester?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nNo. Our program is structured to deliver content and hone skills in a sequence. Students get most of their functional knowledge foundation and participate in an integrative case competition in the first fall semester then take an immersion in the spring that provides exceptional preparation for the summer internship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWill you help me find an internship?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nYes. Our Career Management Center is regarded as one of the best in the world. They maintain and continue to grow the list of companies that recruit at the Johnson School. Our goal is not only to help you get an internship and then a job, but to ensure that you leave with the skills to successfully search for positions throughout your career. At the Johnson School, you’ll frequently find students critiquing each other’s resumes, putting each other through mock interviews, and offering encouragement and support. Our alumni are also involved in helping students prepare for interviews.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhat are my chances of gaining admission into the Johnson School two-year MBA program?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nThe short answer is: We don’t know and won’t until you apply. If you look at the profile of our admitted students, read our student blogs, and see yourself at the Johnson School, then please apply!\nOur goal is to select individuals who will not only succeed in our MBA program, but make a real and lasting impact on their organizations and the world around them. Our goal is to select individuals who will succeed in our MBA program and make a real and lasting difference in their organizations and the world around them. We recruit students with a broad range of backgrounds and experiences such that everyone contributes to and benefits from a culture in which learning is an intensely shared process. So while a strong undergraduate record, high scores on the GMAT, and success in jobs are all important considerations, we also look for demonstrations of leadership, the ability to work with others, and other traits and experiences that contribute to individual success and collaborative learning and work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI don’t have any full-time work experience.
