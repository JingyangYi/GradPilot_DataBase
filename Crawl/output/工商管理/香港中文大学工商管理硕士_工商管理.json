Auditing\nSpecific research topics include modelling and statistical research in auditing, behavioral issues in auditing, human information processing in auditing, auditor's responsibilities and liabilities, and economic-based approaches to auditing research.\n4. International Accounting and Accounting in China\nAlthough all research in these areas is undertaken within the Faculty, current research is moving towards the behavioral, organizational and cultural dimensions of accounting studies utilizing capital market, agency, contingency and other contemporary theories. In line with the research ethos of the Faculty, the research thrust in the School has an interdisciplinary flavor, and draws heavily on the disciplines of statistical decision theory, psychology, economics, sociology and law.\nPlease visit the Division’s homepage for more information.\nIn addition to the general requirements of the Graduate School, applicants should fulfill the requirements as set by the Faculty of Business Administration.  Please refer to the programme's website for details.\nMain Round: 1 December 2024Clearing Round: 31 March 2025(Applications in Clearing Round will only be considered subject to availability of places.)\nTo submit an initial application to RGC: By 12 noon, 1 December 2024 (Hong Kong time); and to submit a full application to CUHK: By 11:59 pm, 1 December 2024 (Hong Kong time).\nPlease refer to the HKPFS page for more details.\nhttp://grad.bschool.cuhk.edu.hk/\nOffered by the School of Hotel and Tourism Management, the programme is research-oriented with each student being directly supervised by a faculty member.\nMPhil Stream\nPre-candidacy\nPost-candidacy\nFields of Specialization\nThe hospitality and real estate industries are the rapid growth industries in this region.\nResearch activities conducted at the Center of Hospitality and Real Estate Research cover the areas of hospitality, tourism, real estate, and finance and span a wide spectrum of relevant topics. Among the two streams, students can choose to specialize in either hospitality or real estate.\n1. Hospitality Marketing and Tourism\nThe growth of service industries has created a strong demand for research into marketing approaches that increase service effectiveness given the unique characteristics of intangibility, inseparability, perishability, and variability intrinsic to consumer behavior.  We emphasize on Service Innovation, Big Data Analytics, Hospitality Leadership, Business Sustainability and Social Media research. We are also the leading Hotel School for conducting impactful research on service robotics in the hospitality and tourism industries.\n2. Real Estate and Finance\nThe real estate industry has generated many new and interesting research topics. Major issues examined include property valuation, property acquisition and financing methods, the best use of property, and the development of secondary property equity and debt markets. Specific interdisciplinary research topics that integrate with hospitality, economics and accounting concentrate on corporate finance and agency issues in Real Estate Investment Trusts, asset pricing theories, market efficiency of property markets, and economics of corporate location. There are also growing interests in research examining the unique features of mainland China and Hong Kong property markets, as well as the sustainability and diversity in real estate firms and investments.\nMain Round: 1 December 2024 Clearing Round: 31 March 2025 (Applications in Clearing Round will only be considered subject to availability of places.)\nMPhil Stream\nPre-candidacy\nPost-candidacy\nFields of Specialization\nCourses offered by the Department of Decisions, Operations and Technology concentrate on four areas: Business Economics, Management Information Systems, Operations Management and Quantitative Methods. In addition, cross-disciplinary research efforts are also carried out in many areas. The research activities of the faculty members can be broadly categorized into the following three areas:\n1.

Its strong professorial contingent consists of, among others, Academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, IEEE Fellows, and the first Chinese scholar to win the prestigious Turing Award. Learn More\nThe University reserves the right to suspend admission of a programme without prior notice.\nThis articulated MPhil-PhD programme in Biomedical Engineering is offered by the Faculty of Engineering as an inter-disciplinary programme in close collaboration with the Faculty of Medicine. It builds on the strengths of the two Faculties in biomedical sciences and engineering with the aim to educate future leaders who can master the fundamental knowledge base and innovate technology to address various health and clinical challenges in our time and beyond.\nMPhil Stream\nAn MPhil student is required to complete a number of graduate courses offered by the Division, or by other Divisions of the Faculties of Engineering, Medicine and Science, subject to the approval of the supervisor and Division Head. The student must submit a satisfactory thesis and successfully defend it. Students with good academic performance in their first year of study may be permitted to transfer to the PhD Stream.\nAll students in the PhD Stream are admitted initially to the pre-candidacy status. After completing a required number of graduate courses, passing a candidacy examination, and having successfully defended the thesis proposal, the student will be allowed to progress to the post-candidacy status. The student must complete a PhD thesis with substantial amount of original research work, and have the thesis properly written, presented and successfully defended.\nFields of Specialization\nBiomaterials and Regenerative Medicine\nBiomolecular Engineering and Nano medicine\nMedical Imaging and Informatics\nMedical Instrumentation and Biosensors\nIn addition to the general requirements of the Graduate School, applicants should have / should preferably have:1. Curriculum Vitae ;2. research outputs ;3. an indicative statement of research interest or purpose of study (about 500 words) ;4. copies of awards and certificates ;5. class ranking.\nMain Round: 1 December 2024Clearing Round: 31 March 2025(Applications in Clearing Round will only be considered subject to availability of places.)\nPlease refer to the HKPFS page for more details.\nhttp://www.bme.cuhk.edu.hk/new/mphil-phd.php\nMPhil Stream\nThe major graduation requirements for an MPhil student include:\nStudents may apply to transfer to the PhD stream if they can satisfy the PhD admission requirements after completing the first year of study.\nAll students in the PhD stream will be admitted initially in the 'pre-candidacy' status. Upon satisfying the Division's candidacy requirements, a student will be allowed to progress to the 'post-candidacy' status.\nFields of Specialization\nComputer Science Programme\nComputer Engineering Programme\nPlease visit the Division's homepage for more information.\nIn addition to the general requirements of the Graduate School, applicants should normally hold an honour degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering or related fields.\nApart from applying in GS's admission system, please also submit your application and upload supporting documents here: https://dept-eappsrv.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/pgas2025/ before deadline.\nAll supporting documents (CV, transcript, graduation certificate, ID copy and English report) should be mailed to division too.\nhttps://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk\nOur articulated MPhil-PhD programme provides students with an opportunity of being involved in in-depth studies and focused research in selected areas of electronic engineering. The programme is intended to foster high-quality and forward-looking research activities, so as to meet the society’s demand for high-caliber engineers who are knowledgeable in the latest technologies.\nStarting from 2013, there will be a screening test for both the MPhil and PhD students 9 months after admission. The purpose of the test is to find out if the student has the aptitude to carry out research at a postgraduate level in their chosen specialization. Failure of the test may result in the termination of the postgraduate studentship.\nMPhil Stream\nAn MPhil student is required to complete 4 graduate-level courses.\nIn addition, the student is required to carry out a research project of about 18 months in a duration from which a satisfactory thesis is to be submitted. The student must also attend an oral examination to present his/her work to an appointed thesis committee. Students with good academic performance in their first year of study may be permitted to transfer to the PhD Stream.\nThe PhD stream provides in-depth training for students who are interested in basic or applied research. All students in the PhD stream will be admitted initially in the pre-candidacy status. Upon satisfying the Division’s candidacy requirements, a student will be allowed to progress to the post-candidacy status.\nThe candidacy examination is a written examination to ensure that the student has a sufficient set of knowledge in Electronic Engineering.
