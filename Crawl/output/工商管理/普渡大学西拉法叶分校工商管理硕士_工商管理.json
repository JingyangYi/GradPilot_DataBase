Students can choose to complete the program in either 12 or 18 months, providing flexibility to accommodate different career paths and allowing students additional time to gain valuable industry experience.\nIn the current era, technology is deeply intertwined with business operations. Decision-makers need to be adept at evaluating technological investments, understanding the implications of new technology trends, and predicting potential challenges and opportunities they might bring. Consequently, businesses require professionals and leaders who understand both business and technology to drive innovation and stay competitive.\nArvind Raman, Dean of Purdue's College of Engineering, says interdisciplinary programs can sometimes compromise on rigor — not so when it comes to the new MBT program, he says. Hear Raman, Daniels School Dean Jim Bullard, and MBT Academic Director Mohammad Rahman discuss the program's curriculum, which includes a thought-leader speaker series.\nThis 36-credit hour program leverages Purdue’s strengths in STEM in partnership with Purdue’s world-class College of Engineering and our vibrant ecosystem of technological ventures.\nOur highly capable graduates will express both traditional business acumen and a deep understanding of technology, driven by developments like digital transformation trends, automation, and artificial intelligence (AI).\nComputational Business Intelligence\nThis course provides a comprehensive introduction to the principles and practices of business intelligence (BI) using computational methods. Students will explore a range of topics from the fundamentals of BI to advanced data manipulation and business applications of machine learning techniques. The course is designed to equip students with the skills necessary to gather, analyze, and visualize data to support strategic business decisions.\nTotal Required Core Credits: 26\nWhile an MBA trains business managers for competency across general management domains, the MBT has evolved in response to industries in which technology has an outsized impact on the functions of the organization's products and processes.\nBoth the MBT and the MBA ensure managers have exceptional accounting, marketing, financial management, communication, and leadership skills. The general MBA rounds out a manager's knowledge set with further human resource, business analytics, strategy, operations, economic principles, change management, supply chain and global strategy, providing a high-level competency for graduates. It serves non-technical managerial positions and industries.\nIn place of broad management courses common to the MBA, the MBT homes in on digital product design, computational business intelligence, technology-drive business, governance and regulations, tech strategies, DevOps and tech solutions, economic analysis of tech markets and emerging technologies and their business models.\nSee the curricular differences side-by-side to better understand why engineers and tech specialists across industries choose the MBT. Because of their passion for their field and technologies, technical specialists and engineers value the MBT over the MBA to take on leadership roles that are future forward, extending their expertise and building upon their field of knowledge.\nDownload Curriculum Comparison\nStudents may take 10 credits in elective courses from a range of available courses. As such, students have the freedom to tailor their experience to a specific area of interest. Creating an area of focus, customization through electives would deepen a student’s knowledge in a given field. A student may, however, decide not to pursue a specific focus area, but rather blend elective courses.\nTotal Required Elective Credits: 10\nMachine Learning\nWith the rise in big data, Machine Learning has experienced rapid growth over the last ten years with major advances in its subfields of Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Robotics, and other subfields. The purpose of this course is to provide the students with a systematic introduction to the recent developments in machine learning through the coverage of modern machine learning concepts and practical business applications, as well as hands-on experience with modern machine learning frameworks. The course plans to cover neural nets, convolutional neural networks, recurrent networks, deep generative models, deep reinforcement learning, and the trustworthy AI framework with the properties of safety, robustness, privacy, and fairness.\nVisual Analytics\nThis course equips students with the creative and technical proficiency needed to convert data into insightful visual reports, fostering mutual comprehension. Students will harness software tools to intake, structure, and illustrate data, prioritizing design principles to craft concise and aesthetically pleasing graphs and dashboards. They will delve into both exploratory and explanatory data visualization methods for effective data narration. Collaborative team projects will further hone their skills and facilitate peer learning. Authentic, real-world data sets will form the basis for our classroom activities and group assignments.\nMachine Learning\n* Students may take other related business courses that do not correspond to or have significant overlap with required courses already taken.\nDownload Plan of Study\nIf you would like to receive more information about the Master of Business and Technology program at Purdue, please fill out the form and a Program Specialist will be in touch.\nWe also have availability to meet with you virtually to discuss how your goals align with our curriculum, community, student experiences, and outcomes to determine if Purdue is the right fit for you!\nSchedule an Appointment\n[HTML_TABLE]\nCredits | Course Title\n3 | Capstone\n2 | Accounting for Managers\n2 | Computational Business Intelligence\n\nComputational Business Intelligence\nThis course provides a comprehensive introduction to the principles and practices of business intelligence (BI) using computational methods.

The business school awards approximately $800,000 in scholarships each year to undergraduate students, made possible by the generosity of our alumni and friends.\nAll incoming undergraduate students will be evaluated for business school scholarships as long as they apply by November 1 their senior year of high school. There is no separate application.\nScholarship recipients are selected by a scholarship committee that uses a holistic review of the student. Some scholarships may be given based on financial need as determined by the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). We encourage all students to complete the FAFSA by February 15 in order to maximize consideration for all federal, state, and institutional funds they may be eligible to receive.\nVisit the Purdue Division of Financial Aid for:\nVisit the Division of Financial Aid\nReach out to the Daniels School of Business Undergraduate Recruiting Team!\nWe are here to help you through this process.\nContact Recruiting Team\nAll undergraduate students who complete their application for admission by November 1 are automatically considered for university-wide merit scholarships.\nTo be considered for additional scholarships like Stamps Scholars or Beering Scholars, you can apply to the John Martinson Honors College when you apply to Purdue through the Common App.\nThrough the Lilly Scholars at Purdue program, a selection of talented incoming undergraduate students will benefit from a long-standing partnership between the university and Eli Lilly and Company. The Daniels School has four STEM undergraduate programs — Business Analytics and Information Management; Economics; Integrated Business and Engineering (IBE); and Supply Chain and Operations Management — and students in these majors are given preference.\nIn your application portal there is a Scholarship Universe portal which may have supplemental Purdue scholarships matching to a student and a list of outside scholarships.\nStudents will learn about scholarships from the Daniels School in their financial aid package, sent out beginning in April.\nInformation about other university scholarships may be in a student’s admission decision.\n“My scholarship made a difference not only to my financial life, but in my outlook on myself. It meant the world to me to know that my school believed in me. You’re told you’re good enough by friends and family, but to hear it from your own institution brings such a confidence boost.”\nAbbie Griffiths General Management & Marketing, Class of 2022\nIf you are interested in giving to the Daniels School and would like information about supporting students through scholarships, please visit our Giving page.\n• FAFSA tips\n• Portal to submit the FAFSA\n• Call Center information\n• Much more\n[CARD]\nVisit the Purdue Division of Financial Aid for:\n[CARD]\nContact Recruiting Team",
