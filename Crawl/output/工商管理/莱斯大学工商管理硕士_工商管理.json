Companies are hiring Rice MBAs because they’re ready to lead — and because they know how to solve real-world problems with insight, creativity and a collaborative mindset.\nOver the past three years, Rice Full-Time MBA graduates have drawn employers from across various sectors, led by financial services, consulting, energy and technology.\nHere’s a look at the top employers in each of the five most in-demand sectors for our students:\nWhile every year presents new hiring challenges in the ever-evolving business landscape, it’s clear the Rice Business network works: nearly all first-year Full-Time MBAs secured internships, and most were made possible by school connections.\nPlus, Rice Business saw a surge of new companies hiring Rice Business students this past year, contributing to the more than 175 employers who have hired full-time students from the classes of 2024 and 2025. Details on recent hiring employers and incomes of our Full-Time MBA graduates are available in our career outcomes report.\nAt Rice, Professional MBA students bring eight years of work experience — and leave ready to lead, launch or level up. For these graduates, energy remains a top industry, with about one-third of graduates accepting roles in the field — whether continuing their careers or making a strategic move. Others are landing positions in consulting, financial services and a wide range of other sectors.\nMore than 40% of our recent Professional MBA alumni accepted roles at new companies —  a strong signal that the Rice MBA opens doors to bold career moves, whether that means changing industries, shifting functions or stepping into new leadership roles. Many also advance within their current organizations, earning promotions and expanded responsibilities before they even graduate.\nAnd with an average starting salary north of $150k and a high rate of signing bonuses, our Professional MBA graduates are seeing a strong return on investment. More importantly, they’re finding work that excites them — roles that challenge, inspire and align with their long-term goals.\nWhile this data reflects outcomes for our Professional MBAs, Hybrid MBA students benefit from the same rigorous curriculum, career support and community that drive these results. Read more about our Professional MBA student outcomes in the career highlights here.\nAt Rice Business, career support doesn’t end when you land your first post-MBA role — it’s designed to grow with you. Whether you're stepping into a new role, making a change ten years down the line or launching something of your own, you'll always have a community in your corner.\nThe Rice Business alumni network runs deep — rooted in Houston’s dynamic business world and connected across industries and continents. Backed by a dedicated career development team and alumni programming that keeps you plugged in, the Rice MBA is more than a degree. It’s a long-term investment in your growth.\nIf you’re looking for smart, driven professionals who know how to solve problems and work well with others, you’ll find them here.

Applications for Fall 2025 are open, and we’re excited for you to take the next step toward joining our community. You belong here — and together, we’ll work toward getting you where you want to be. Review the application deadlines below.\nCandidates may only apply to one Rice Business graduate degree program per application cycle. If you were, at any time, a former Rice Business graduate student, please indicate you are a re-applicant in your current application.  Please reach out to our team with any questions – we’re here to help you every step of the way.\nPlease select a program to find the relevant application deadlines.\n*The Round 4 deadline is for domestic candidates only (U.S. Citizens or Permanent Residents).\n**Decisions may be released earlier if the application and review are complete.\nWe encourage you to apply early to gain the advantage: Compete with a smaller number of applicants for the greatest number of seats. Secure more time and support to prepare for the program (including a quantitative skills prep course and a custom workshops for enrolled students). Expand your connections by attending networking events months before the program begins.\nApplications are accepted on a rolling basis for each of our four intake terms (October, January, April, or July). We invite you to learn more about the application requirements and deadlines for our online MBA.\nThe application will open on August 1, and the submission deadline is May 19, 2025, 11:59 PM CT. Please follow the requirements for the Full-Time MBA.\nUse our admissions process guide to build your best application. The Deferred Enrollment MBA program follows the Full-Time MBA program admissions process (with the exception of GMAT waivers, which are not available for the Deferred Enrollment program).\nPrinter-friendly checklists:☑Full-Time MBA   ☑Professional MBA   ☑Hybrid MBA   ☑Executive MBA\nTo submit your application, you must upload unofficial copies of transcripts for each degree that you have earned or any degree in process. Your transcripts must include the name of the degree awarded and the degree conferral date if the degree has been awarded. Please note an undergraduate degree is required to apply to our MBA programs.\nFor the Deferred Enrollment MBA application, please submit the transcripts of the courses that you have completed and provide a list of courses that you are currently enrolled in. You will also need to submit your final transcript once you complete your undergraduate studies.\nIf you are admitted and decide to enroll with us, you will be required to send us official (physical or electronic) transcripts from each bachelor's or graduate degree(s) earned from U.S. degree-granting institution(s).\nTo ensure credential standardization, we require that all transcripts from non-U.S. degree-granting institutions be reviewed by a third-party transcript evaluation service. You are welcome to use any of the below companies for this process.\nThe evaluation will also fulfill the requirement of an official transcript for that institution.\nIf the evaluation shows the degree to not be equivalent to that of a 4-year U.S. bachelor's degree, the Admissions Committee may rescind the offer of admission.\nNote: If the Admissions Committee notices inconsistencies with the accuracy or legibility of your unofficial transcripts, we reserve the right to request that you send us an official transcript before releasing your final decision.\njump to top\nWe require a standardized test for admission to our Full-Time, Professional and Hybrid MBA programs. Full-Time MBA candidates may be eligible for a standardized test waiver. Professional MBA and Hybrid MBA candidates may submit an application without a test score with sufficient reasoning. Please read below for more details.\nFull-Time MBA candidates may be eligible for a standardized test waiver. For more information, please review the Standardized Test Waiver Request webpage. Please note that you need to start an application to gain access to the test waiver request form. Test waivers need to be submitted 10 days prior to the application.\nFor Professional MBA and Hybrid MBA applicants, we require a standardized test however, if you feel you have sufficient reasoning for a test waiver, such as a terminal degree, a master's degree or more than 3 years of work experience, you may submit your application without a test score. Please submit the optional essay explaining your qualifications. Please note, if you submit without a score, the admissions committee reserves the right to request a test score after review of your application.\nFor Executive MBA applicants, we do not require a test but you may submit a valid test score if you have one.\nYou may reference the chart below for the types of tests we accept for each MBA program:\nWhen You Apply:\nAs you work on your application, you will be required to upload a copy of your GRE/GMAT or EA test score. During the application process, please submit the official test score report. As of July 1, 2024, official test score reports will be required in order to receive an admissions decision.\nApplicants to the MD/MBA dual degree program may submit their MCAT scores to complete their MBA applications and to be considered for merit-based scholarships.\nBefore we render an admission decision, we require that you have your official scores sent to us using the codes below:\nWe encourage you to take your standardized tests early in the admissions process. If you are unhappy with your test score, we also encourage you to consider retaking the test. We do not look upon retakes negatively, and we will consider only your highest score when reviewing your application for admission.\nIf you do decide to retake a test after you have submitted your application, please let us know and we will be happy to consider your application with the updated score (although your application may be pushed to the next application round).\njump to top\nIn order to assess your work experience, we require you to submit a professional resume. Spend some time before submitting your application to make sure that your resume is up-to-date and appropriate to use in an application to a business school.\nWe also want to learn about who you are outside of your job duties, so our application includes an entire section dedicated to your extracurricular involvement. Use this space to list the groups you are a member of, the activities you lead, and the impact you have on your community. You will also have a chance to talk about any awards or special recognition that you have received.\nFor those applying to the Deferred Enrollment MBA program, please focus your resume on your extracurricular activities, including, but not limited to, internships, student club involvement, and volunteer work.\nIn general, your professional resume should be no longer than one page (as opposed to an academic curriculum vitae, or CV). Rather than serve as an exhaustive list of all of your job duties, your resume should highlight your employment history, education, and extracurricular involvement.\njump to top\nA letter of recommendation is a required component of the Rice MBA application. While any professional recommendation is accepted, we'd prefer a letter from your current or a former supervisor. A maximum of two (2) letters of recommendation are allowed.\nRice MBA programs use the GMAC Common Letter of Recommendation, which allows recommenders to answer the same set of questions for multiple business school applications.\nAfter entering your recommender’s contact information into your application, the application system will immediately send an electronic \"Common Recommendation\" form to that individual.\nFor those applying to the Deferred Enrollment MBA program, one of your recommendations can be from an academic source, but one must be from a supervisor from work or extracurricular activity.\nIn addition to the official recommendations, if you know a current Rice MBA student or alumni you may ask them to write you a Build the Class referral, which will qualify you for an application fee waiver.\njump to top\nEssays are an opportunity to provide a better understanding of your unique perspective and aspirations. The Full-Time, Professional MBA and Hybrid MBA programs require two and the Executive MBA requires one.\nFor Deferred Enrollment MBA applicants, please follow the instructions for the Full-Time MBA essay requirements.\nOptional Essay: (500-word limit)\nIf you have any additional information for the admissions committee or if you wish to clarify any aspect of your application (including breaks in employment, your choice of recommendation providers, your past academic performance, etc.), you may submit an additional, optional essay.\n\r\nProfessional MBA and Hybrid MBA applicants, if you plan to submit your application without a test score, please submit the optional essay explaining why. We don't require a long explanation, only share your reasoning, i.e. terminal degree, a master's degree or more than 3 years of work experience.\njump to top\nOnce your application has been submitted and the application fee of US$200.00 has been paid*, our Admissions Committee will begin reviewing your application.\n*We are proud to offer application fee waivers to:\njump to top\nWe review applications comprehensively, which means that not any piece of the application is viewed as more important than the others. Rather, we evaluate the quantitative (years of work, GMAT score, GPA, etc.) and qualitative (leadership, community involvement, career progression, etc.) elements of your application together to determine your overall fit with the program.\nThroughout the application process, we will check to make sure that we have all of the information we need to properly review your application. If we require additional clarification regarding a piece of your application or notice that you are missing important material, we will reach out to you via email or telephone.\nWhen the preliminary review of your application file is complete, the Admissions Committee may extend an invitation to participate in the additional assessment activities outlined below.\nDue to the number of applications received every year, we are not able to extend an invitation for additional assessment activities to every applicant. Please note, however, that if you do not receive an invitation for additional assessment activities before decisions are set to be released, this does not automatically mean we are no longer considering your candidacy.\nRice Video InterviewRice Business utilizes a virtual platform as an additional assessment component. This is an opportunity for you to showcase your motivations for pursuing an MBA at Rice Business and alignment with our culture.\nInterviewThis is a conversation between you and a member of the Rice Business community. Our interviews will be conducted in-person or via Zoom.\nDue to the number of applications received every year, we are not able to extend an invitation to interview for every applicant. Please note, however, that if you do not receive an invitation to interview before decisions are set to be released, this does not automatically mean we are no longer considering your candidacy.\nComplete applications submitted by Round 1 and Round 2 will have priority consideration for merit-based scholarships (Full-Time MBA only).\nIf you retake a test, add a new line on your resume, or have any other updates to your submitted application, please upload the documents to your application portal.\nWhile we do not give feedback on individual applications after an admissions decision has been made, we are more than happy to work with you any time during the application process to help you put forward your best application.\nCandidates may only apply to one Rice Business graduate degree program per application cycle. If you were, at any time, a former Rice Business graduate student, please indicate that you are a \"re-applicant\" in your current application.\nPlease do not hesitate to email, call, or schedule an on-campus meeting with a member of the Rice MBA Recruiting and Admissions team. We look forward to getting to know you!\nTo be eligible to apply to the Rice MBA program, we require applicants to hold a four-year U.S. bachelor's degree, or its international equivalent. In addition, for our working professional programs, you must already have a valid visa that allows you to study in the United States, like an H1B, L1, TN or similar. Only the Full-Time MBA program sponsors an I-20 for international applicants.\nIf you are admitted and choose to enroll with us, you will be asked to have your transcript evaluated by a third-party evaluation company to verify grades, curriculum and that your undergraduate degree is indeed the equivalent to a U.S. bachelor's degree. (To ensure credential standardization, we require that all transcripts from non-U.S. degree-granting institutions be reviewed by a third-party transcript evaluation service.) You are welcome to use any of the below three companies for this process.\nThe Rice MBA programs have an extremely competitive pool of talented candidates, so while we may not have been able to offer you admission in a previous admissions year, we invite you to consider reapplying to the program in the future. Since prospective students cannot apply more than once during an admissions cycle, we suggest using the time between your decision and the opening of a future admissions cycle to self-assess your last application and think of ways that you could improve it.\nTo reapply, you will need to submit a new application. This will require new essays, new letters of recommendation, and another application fee of US$200.00.\nIf you decide to apply again, you will also need to complete an additional, required re-applicant essay:\n“Think about the time that has elapsed since you last applied to Rice Business. What actions have you taken to improve your candidacy?” (500-word limit)\nUnless your test scores have expired (five years for the GMAT and GRE tests), you will not need to worry about re-sending your score reports to us; we will still have access to your scores and will be able to add them to your application. We will also still have your official transcripts on file if you chose to send your transcripts to us previously.\nYour MBA, your way.
