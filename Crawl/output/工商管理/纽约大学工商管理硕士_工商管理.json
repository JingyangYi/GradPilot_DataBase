(Video length: 4.49)\nDesigned for working professionals, the mostly online format lets you learn on your time, on your schedule, without taking time away from your career.\nGet the essential business foundation of an MBA with less time and investment than an MBA.\nA 20-month, highly-structured curriculum keeps you on pace and on track.\nWith a tight-knit cohort of around 50 students, immersive NYC residencies, and collaborative group work, the program offers rich opportunities to connect, network, and grow alongside peers.\nThe Online Master’s in Management (MiM) program is designed for early career professionals who want to continue to advance their careers while earning a one-of-a-kind business degree from the top-ranked NYU Stern School of Business.\nThe program is ideally suited for those who are non-business majors as the curriculum consists of a comprehensive set of business management foundation courses. These courses are delivered in a convenient online format taught by our world renowned Stern faculty who teach on campus. The program also offers the option to transfer into our Part-time MBA.\nSo, whether you pursue the MiM as an alternative to the MBA, or eventually transfer from the MiM into our Part-time MBA program, we prepare motivated students like you to advance along your current career path and thrive in data-driven, leadership roles.\nOur program offers unmatched convenience with courses that fit your schedule. Each three-week course delivers dynamic, engaging content, ensuring an immersive online learning experience. Most coursework is self-paced; structured deadlines help keep students on track. Your online studies combine independent work with occasional team projects for a balanced learning experience.\nOur online MiM builds a solid foundation in key business disciplines, preparing you to think strategically and make thoughtful, informed decisions. You’ll gain exposure to analytical tools and learn how to apply them in practical ways—so you’re prepared to tackle real-world challenges with confidence.\nDevelop lasting personal and professional bonds with your cohort of MiM peers, and join a large and distinguished alumni network. Stern has more than 110,000 alumni, including 500+ CEOs, in nearly every industry and 138 countries. During the Residential Immersion, you’ll visit campus to network and build lasting relationships with classmates, professors, and industry leaders.\nAn MiM degree is a Master of Science in Management. It is typically intended for early career professionals looking for core business essentials. Often, these programs are intended for non-business majors.\nStudents take 22 courses, one at a time, over 20 months. Each course spans about three weeks and includes two lessons each week. MiM courses are largely self-paced. The content is a mix of short video lessons, interactive modules, problem walk-throughs, readings, self-assessments, and other engaging learning experiences—complemented by weekly, live Online Meetups that allow students to interact with their professors and classmates.\nThe program kicks off with a Residential Immersion over a long weekend on Stern’s campus in New York City, where students network with peers and faculty while completing half of their first course. A second residency a year later offers another high-impact mix of learning, networking, collaboration, and fun. Faculty and staff provide personalized support, ensuring students stay engaged and connected throughout the program.\nThe estimated tuition and fees for NYU Stern’s MiM program is $74,976 for students who started the program in Fall 2024.\nVisit our Tuition & Fees page for more information about the program's cost and payment plan option, and explore our Financial Aid & Tuition page to learn more about financial aid, loan programs, scholarships, fellowships, and more.\nMiM students and alumni gain career support through Stern’s Working Professionals team, unlocking lifelong access to expert career coaching, exclusive job opportunities, and high-impact networking events. The MiM program provides the strategies and connections needed to advance in your career—not start over.\nCareer services include:\nYes, eligible MiM students can transfer to Stern's Part-time MBA program. Visit our Switching from the MiM to the Part-time MBA Program page for more information about eligibility requirements and deadlines.\nStern’s Online MiM program offers unparalleled convenience, making it possible for you to balance work, life, and career advancement. The program is mostly online and allows you to learn on your time, on your schedule. We also host timezone-friendly live online meetups each week, in which you can interact with your professor and classmates.\nThe only in-person aspect of the program are the two residential immersions, which are a highlight of the MiM program. These immersive, four-day residencies are held on the Stern campus in New York City. The first residency takes place in August, during which you’ll build lasting connections and complete half of your first course through hands-on learning. A second residency a year later delivers another high-impact opportunity for networking, collaboration, and professional growth.\nWith its dynamic curriculum, personalized support, and convenient format, the Online MiM helps you stay engaged, connected, and focused on your academic journey—without putting your career on hold.\nNYU Stern’s Online MS in Management delivers the same world-class education as Stern’s on-campus programs, ensuring academic rigor and an engaging learning experience. Courses are designed in collaboration with the Learning Science Lab, using research-based best practices to optimize online learning. MiM students learn from the same distinguished Stern faculty who teach in the MBA program—professors who undergo specialized training in online instruction.\nThe program’s online structure is enriched by optional live virtual meetups, where students can engage with faculty in real-time. Two residential immersions in NYC provide hands-on learning, networking opportunities, and access to industry leaders. Students also become part of Stern’s thriving global community, connecting with peers, faculty, and a vast alumni network.\nThrough a holistic admissions process, Stern selects students with strong intellect, leadership potential, and a commitment to impact—bringing together a cohort of professionals ready to succeed in today’s business world.\nMiM students join Stern’s global alumni network, gaining access to 110,000+ graduates across 130+ countries—including a strong presence in the tri-state area. This dynamic community of industry leaders, entrepreneurs, and executives offers valuable connections, career support, and lasting relationships to help you grow professionally.\nKey networking opportunities include:\nIt takes 20 months to complete Stern’s Online MS in Management. The program consists of 22 courses (1.5 credits each), totaling 33 credits, with students taking one course at a time for a focused, immersive learning experience. This structured format ensures academic rigor and convenience, allowing you to balance work, school, and life while advancing your career.\nThe NYU Stern MiM program does not require a standardized test, such as the GMAT, GRE, or GMAC Executive Assessment. Students with scores are welcome to submit them if they believe it’ll strengthen their application—especially if their academic or professional background does not sufficiently demonstrate quantitative, verbal, and reasoning abilities.\nApplicants are provided the opportunity to provide a written explanation within their application of how their academic background and professional experience reflects these skills.\nMastery of English is required for Stern programs. International applicants and non-native English speakers must demonstrate their level of English proficiency. Visit our Tests & Waivers page for more information.\nThe Master’s in Business Administration (MBA) and the Master’s in Management (MiM) are both graduate-level business degrees, but they are specifically designed for different audiences with different objectives.\nThe MIM program is primarily designed for busy working professionals who are early in their careers (typically having less than six years of work experience), did not major in business in college, and are looking for a convenient online program to provide core business knowledge to help them continue to advance on their current path.\nMBA programs typically serve a broader range of students who are looking to gain both core business knowledge as well as deeper, more specific, functional area education (either with specializations or concentrations). MBA programs typically come in one of three formats:  Full-time, Part-time and Executive MBA.\nFull-time MBAs are full-time, in-person programs, and are best for those looking to make a career change as part of their MBA. Part-time is typically in person as well and best for busy working professionals seeking to gain business knowledge without putting their careers on hold.  Executive MBAs are similar to Part-time MBAs, but are designed for more experienced professionals who are more advanced in their careers.\nThe MiM program covers material typically contained within an MBA program’s core curriculum, but does not include the electives or specializations typically offered in the second half of an MBA program. These specialized electives allow students to dive deeper into specific areas of study.\n• Top-ranked business school: NYU Stern is ranked #6 in Best Business Schools by U.S. News & World Report\n• Core business knowledge: Our essential business foundations curriculum is designed for non-business majors and covers all the key areas of business, including leadership, strategy, marketing, economics, finance, and data analysis\n• Convenient online learning and part-time schedule: Take most of your courses online, one at a time, over 20 months – without putting your career on hold\n• Residential immersions in NYC: Join us for two four-day residential immersions on campus.
