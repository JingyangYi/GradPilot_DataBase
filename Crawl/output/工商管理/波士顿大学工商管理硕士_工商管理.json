Typical jobs in this area include finance associate, financial analyst, director of finance, treasury analyst, director of financial planning and analysis, senior accountant, corporate auditor, development officer, or risk manager.\nAC 814 Financial Statement Analysis & Investor Decisions\nFE 810 Finance 2\nFE 820 Corporate Financial Management\nAC 830 Managerial Accounting\nFE 827 International Financial Management\nBE 834 Macroeconomics in the Global Environment\nFE 713 Finance 3\nFE 870 Analysis and Management of Financial Risk\nThis Pathway is for students who want to focus on domestic and international investment analysis and strategy. Typical jobs in this area include relationship banker, financial planner, loan officer, trust officer, investment banking associate, M&A associate, buy side analyst, equity or fixed income researcher, director of investor relations, or capital markets sales associate.\nFE 822 Fixed Income Markets\nFE 823 Investments\nFE 713 Finance 3\nFE 850 Private Equity: Leveraged Buyouts\nThis is the right Pathway if you’re interested in focusing on domestic investment strategy and innovative financial technology. Typical jobs in this area include senior analyst, financial analyst, equity and/or fixed income researcher, asset manager, investment operations manager, corporate actions associate, and financial consultant.\nFE 822 Fixed Income Markets\nFE 823 Investments\nFE 713 Finance 3\nChoose this Pathway if you want to work in the fast-paced startup world, with a focus on capital raising, finance investment strategies and tools relating to forecasting and managing needs of startups.

Many Questrom MBAs have formed companies, such as Healthy Gamer, Evertrue, and All in Energy (nonprofit). In this Pathway, you’ll learn the skills of ideation, validation, financial modeling, and pitching that will be crucial to your success as an entrepreneur. In several of these classes, you can work on your own business idea as the class project.\nSI 852 Starting New Ventures\nSI 855 Entrepreneurship\nSI 857 Dilemmas in Scaling New Ventures\nMK 856 Consumer Insights\nOM 854 Operations Analysis and Innovation\nOM 865 Idea Lab\nSI 845 Technology Strategy\nInnovation Pathway (BUild Lab)\nToday’s companies know they must innovate or die. This explains why Corporate Innovation Groups are on the rise in many companies. Choose this Pathway if you want to become an innovator in this field. You’ll learn to manage the cultivation, design, development, and commercialization of new ideas. To be innovative, any new idea must resolve the innovation paradox—introducing enough novelty to appeal to new markets while retaining enough familiarity to tap into existing behaviors. Managers and leaders create the conditions for innovation at the individual, team and organizational levels, and are successful through their knowledge of opportunity recognition, business analytics, idea interdependence, and intellectual property.\nSI 860 Managing Corporate Innovation\nSI 855 Entrepreneurship\nMK 856 Consumer Insights\nOM 865 Idea Lab\nSI 845 Technology Strategy\nSR 801 Social Impact: Business, Society, and the Natural Environment\nSI 852 Starting New Ventures\nLink Day (Nonprofit and Social Ventures)\nFollow this Pathway to become an international entrepreneur. Whether a new venture is a small startup in a predominantly domestic market or a larger operation involving multi-national corporations, an understanding of global financial policies, cultures, and interdependencies is critical for the creation of a compelling business plan and the cultivation of strategic alliances. Building a business model that considers foreign opportunities and volatility relating to supply chain, essential partnerships, and the differences of global markets, will inform potential investors about the feasibility of a product and the scalability of its structure and can be the key to unlocking crucial funding.\nSI 852 Starting New Ventures\nSI 855 Entrepreneurship\nSI 858 Innovation Eco-Systems\nSI 868 International Consulting Project\nFE 838 Emerging Markets: Finance and Investment Strategies\nYou may not want to start your own venture, but instead join an existing early-stage venture or social venture. In this Pathway, you’ll address issues relating to human resource management, funding sources, revenue models, rapid culture change and addressing the multiple challenges caused by rapid growth.\nSI 852 Starting New Ventures\nMO 853 Negotiations\nThe creation of new growth-oriented businesses relies heavily on venture capital and corporate venture capital funding. This Pathway prepares you to handle fundraising, investing (deal structure, terms, due diligence, governance) and gaining liquidity. Partners are responsible for identifying investment objectives and finding suitable opportunities in line with their investment thesis.\nSI 852 Starting New Ventures\nFE 854 Entrepreneurial Finance\nFE 823 Investments\nMO 853 Negotiations\nSI 855 Entrepreneurship\nPerhaps no area of innovation and entrepreneurship is more exciting than “cleantech”:  the development of new technologies, business models and products/services that advance environmental sustainability.  Given that the many observers consider climate change to be the most urgent environmental sustainability issue facing humanity, innovation and entrepreneurship in the energy sector is especially vital to reduce global carbon emissions.\nSelect this Pathway to learn to deal with the recruitment, development, motivation, and retention of a workforce to enable the achievement of an organization’s mission and strategy.

With this degree, you’ll be prepared to lead in the rapidly changing technology industry.\nThe dual-degree MBA+ MS in Digital Technology program is based in a digital tech hub of the world—Boston. Leveraging our location, you’ll acquire the coding, database management, and analytic skills you’ll need to lead on the tech-based business frontier. At the same time, you’ll get a firm grasp of the business side of technology and learn to lead dynamic teams.\nMBA+ MSDT graduates earn an almost 10% higher average starting salary than their MBA counterparts.\nOur program is multi-disciplinary, STEM certified, and focuses on the integration of business and technology. You’ll be taught by technical faculty within Questrom School of Business with expertise in both technology and business and how they relate to each other. Our students emerge with a highly differentiated skill set that prepares them to help companies leverage technology investments for optimal business outcomes.\nYou will learn foundational key concepts such as cloud, artificial intelligence, blockchain, and platforms, as well as the technologies underpinning them.  You will also learn how to create, deploy, and evolve digital products that enhance customer experiences and solve business problems.\nOur students participate in a wide range of opportunities beyond the classroom. These include company-sponsored projects, site visits, the annual Tech Connect conference, and panel discussions with current tech executives and alumni, among many others. Our Boston location is ideal for connections with technical firms, from startups to huge companies across a wide range of sectors, but especially in finance and biotech.\nFor more than 20 years, we’ve been integrating business and technology in all of our teaching and research. A recognized leader in educating students on the importance of information technology in the digital age, we’re always seeking new ways to equip the next generation of leaders with the latest tools—so they can make the greatest impact in business and industry.\nOur faculty members are conducting the research that drives innovation and best practices in today’s complex business world. Leading practitioners and thought leaders, they’ll bring their expertise directly to you in the classroom every day. The MBA+ MSDT program is led and staffed by members of Questrom’s top-ranked Information Systems department. You might be surprised by how accessible they are—they’re world-class, but they’ll know who you are and what drives your passion. You’ll remember them as your mentors, and friends…the ones who helped you reach your career goals.\nThe MBA+ MSDT curriculum will immerse you in content that fuses our dynamic management coursework with experiential learning in business, information, technology, and design. You’ll learn to leverage data and technology from a managerial and strategic standpoint, enabling you to transform existing markets and grow new ones—all while acquiring the global and ethical frameworks you’ll need to lead.\nOur students get a sense of what is hard about creating products/analysis/processes that are scalable and robust in a way that you don’t get from just learning basic programming.\nBecause much of the MBA+ MSDT curriculum technical content relies on programming, students often have questions about this specifically. We deliver content on both core programming skills (Python) and knowledge of advanced programming constructs. While our graduates generally don’t become programmers as their primary job function, many do when occasion calls. More importantly, almost all our graduates interact with programmers regularly as part of their job function. We teach programming differently than other programs. There are enormous differences between the programs you create in Programming 101, and what is needed to create real-world products, processes, and analysis.\nCourse content is delivered at a level/depth such that it is an appropriate foundation for all of our students. Students interested in particular areas can then go in-depth through their elective choices.\nAlumni of our program typically hold leadership roles in one of three critical business areas, which match the three pathways offered in the program:\nProduct Managers shepherd a product from both a business and a technical perspective, running data analysis of product effectiveness/improvement, and managing requirements gathering and project planning and management.\nAnalytics professionals either perform their own analysis (at modest-sized firms) or help orchestrate teams of data scientists in larger firms. This role requires the ability to translate between business need and a request for analysis; as well as to interpret data in the light of business decision making.\nSeveral of our alumni are working at major consultancy firms, such as PWC and Deloitte, many in the technology consulting practice. Consultants often work on business process improvement or the creation/integration of business solutions through a combination of IT and management improvements. Similarly, internal consultants often work out of the CIO or CTO’s branch of large companies, working on similar topics, but working in-house rather than through a management consulting firm. These areas are often called “Business solutions” but have a lot of different titles, in practice.\nThere are hundreds of thousands of job opportunities in these areas, from start-ups to the largest firms. Our grads join some of the most exciting firms in each of the three pathways.\nIn the early fall, we run a seminar series focused on each of the three program pathways: Product Management, Analytics, and Internal/External Consulting. These in-depth seminars offer a wealth of content on what it takes land jobs and succeed on each career pathways. The seminars typically include a panel of guest speakers, including alumni, working in these areas.\nIn the late fall and spring, we run a seminar series on topics relating to developing a career in technology and management, in which senior executives present their company and its opportunities. Topics have included Technology Trends – The good, the bad, and the ugly, Advanced Interview Techniques, Resume Creation and Job Strategies, Technology Concepts and Language Students Need to Know for Interviews, Company Focus: Walmart, Company Focus: Ford, Company Focus: Medtronic, and Company Focus: Dell/EMC.\nThe MBA+ MSDT program is intense, but well worth it. Our program provides both technical depth and management context—all in just 21 months.\nAs an MBA+ MSDT student, you’ll complete an 84-credit curriculum and a highly encouraged internship component. The program is comprised of a carefully orchestrated sequence of 7 required technical MSDT-specific classes, in addition to the MBA core. And your choice of a significant number of tech-based business electives. Most (though not all) students will use these electives to focus in one of the three pathways provided in the program: Product Management, Analytics and Internal/External Technology Consulting.  Within this content you will focus on contemporary business perspectives and issues while developing solid skills in collaboration, teamwork, and entrepreneurship. Case studies will help you learn to make the best decisions for the overall organization, not just for a single department or project. You’ll learn to solve problems, avoid creating new ones, simplify issues, and optimize results. In the end, you’ll walk away with two impressive master’s degrees from Boston University in the time it takes most students to earn one!\nStudents in the MBA+ MSDT obtain their 84-credits from three areas:\nAll students complete the Core MBA Curriculum.\nStudents are required to take a 7-class sequence of required classes, 4 of which are delivered in an intensive (out of semester) format. Details on these classes are provided below.\nStudents are required to take technology electives. These may be from a pre-approved list of electives, or students may request a class to count (including via cross-registration), provided it (a) is technical enough (b) makes sense for the program and the student’s goals (c) registration is achievable through the registrar. Further details are provided below.\nDuring the program Launch, you’ll get started right away with Ethics, learning frameworks that will guide your perspective as you continue in the curriculum.\nYour first semester is divided into two 7-week modules. In Module 1, you’ll delve into economics, accounting, and organizational behavior. At the end of the first module, you’ll apply your new knowledge and teaming skills as you evaluate a company as a possible takeover target within a sector.\nModule 2 introduces you to marketing, business analytics, and finance, as well as leadership communications. You’ll polish your presentation skills in our own version of the TED Talk, a “QuestromTalk”! The module ends with a team-based business simulation, allowing you to apply your marketing and business analytics expertise.\nWhen you return in January, you’ll complete an intensive course on digital innovation. Then, you’ll take semester-long courses in operations management, innovation and strategy, as well as options for 7-week or semester-long finance courses—go as deep as you want. In addition, now’s the time to round out the strong business foundation you’ve built with electives that spark your interest. There are 100+ Questrom electives to choose from. During this semester, you’ll also put your new skills to work in an integrative project with a real company—past clients include IBM, GSK, Wayfair, and the City of Boston.\nIn the first three weeks of summer, you’ll take 3 courses central to your knowledge of systems and technologies. You’ll receive intensive exposure to operating systems, telecommunications, and networked systems as they relate to the management of resources and the challenges facing professionals and managers.\nCOURSE CODE: is754\nCOURSE CODE: is889\nExamines the data communication hardware and software characteristics that are relevant to the applications software designer. A general overview of communications network design is presented. Topics covered include issues in the design and use of both local area networks and wide area networks. The impact of communications technology on organizations as well as trends in the communications industry are studied.\nCOURSE CODE: is756\nBy the time you start your summer internship—which is optional, but strongly encouraged—you’ll have already begun differentiating yourself from the competition through solid IT exposure, an understanding of the functional areas of business, and experience with the sectors transforming the global economy. An internship is highly recommended, and serves as an excellent way to gain exposure to, and make contacts within, your desired field.\nYour second year is also semester-based. Now is when you’ll also take the first of two required classes in the year two MSDT curriculum. Specialized coursework will provide you deeper sector and functional knowledge tailored to your post-graduation plans. You’ll take the final required class in the MSDT sequence: a hands-on project class where you and your teammates will design and build a digital product while employing the agile project management approach. Three of the 10 total electives throughout the curriculum must be MSDT electives.\nTechnology electives comprise an important part of the degree program. The pre-approved electives are listed below. Classes outside the pre-approved list may be included for degree credit if the class meets three criterion (1) The class is technical enough (2) The class makes sense for degree context and student career goals (3) The registrar can affect enrollment.\nThe following courses are required:\nCOURSE CODE: is717\nThe objective of this course is to provide an introduction to IT/IS technologies and to provide a hands-on, tutorial-driven, application development experience. The course will be divided into two sessions on each day. For three days, the first session will offer a strategic application of a technology, and the second session, will provide an overview of the technological components that enable this technology. Technologies to be discussed include enterprise systems applications such as ERP systems, SCM systems, and CRM systems. The other two days of the course will focus on using a programming environment to develop one or two simple applications. The \"instructional\" half of the day will cover the key constructs and components of the programming environment and the second half will be a hand-on tutorial on the application of the concepts covered.\nCOURSE CODE: is754\nCOURSE CODE: is756\nCOURSE CODE: is833\nThis course will introduce students to programming-based tools and techniques for becoming analytically-minded managers. The course covers both a hands-on introduction to the concepts, methods and processes of business analytics as well as an introduction to the use of analytics as the basis for creating a competitive advantage. We will review variables, data types, conditionals, loops, and functions, and use these to introduce data structures, including DataFrames.  We will also cover reading and writing raw files and the core APIs in analysis and visualization. With the basics under our belt, we will complement it with some of the most popular libraries for data analysis in Python, such as Pandas and Numpy for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization, and Jupyter Notebook for reporting. These packages will facilitate workflow and enhance the basic Python functionalities. Using them, one can effortlessly clean up a dataset, create elaborate plots, analyze and summarize the data, and produce presentable reports. Throughout the final project, we will learn to extract value from data by asking the right questions and using the appropriate analytical methods and tools. These methods comprise data preprocessing, explanatory analysis, and machine learning techniques. Prior programming experience in Python is required.\nCOURSE CODE: is889\nCOURSE CODE: is883\nCOURSE CODE: is890\nThis course describes how digital transformation increases the reach and  speed of experimentation, and how this in turn both improves execution and  supports innovation.   The course will examine how successful firms  integrate modeling, data gathering, analysis, knowledge synthesis, with both  their planning and operations.  Managing for such an approach requires not  just an agile, but a scaled-agile approach, with multiple parts of the firm  co-evolving in a mutually supportive way.  Working in small teams, students  will apply the concepts to term-length projects.  The class will run as an  applied studio, with teams providing constructive feedback to each other  throughout the term.\nWe believe there is no substitute for technical expertise. Technical skills let you go places you otherwise wouldn’t be able to go, and make you more successful regardless of your path. But we don’t just teach basic skills/programming, and leave it at that. We are just as focused on making sure our students understand the difficult challenges real-world teams face. Our program is built to enable you to confront these challenges and be equipped for success in real companies tackling the most advanced challenges.\nYou can customize your MBA+ MSDT with a focus in the health sector or social impact management—in a city considered the capital of both industries. It’s your vision. We’ll help you make it real.\nFriday, August 8\nSaturday, August 9\nTuesday, August 12\nReady to apply? Once you’ve submitted your materials, we’ll start the review process.

The course covers both a hands-on introduction to the concepts, methods and processes of business analytics as well as an introduction to the use of analytics as the basis for creating a competitive advantage. We will review variables, data types, conditionals, loops, and functions, and use these to introduce data structures, including DataFrames.  We will also cover reading and writing raw files and the core APIs in analysis and visualization. With the basics under our belt, we will complement it with some of the most popular libraries for data analysis in Python, such as Pandas and Numpy for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization, and Jupyter Notebook for reporting. These packages will facilitate workflow and enhance the basic Python functionalities. Using them, one can effortlessly clean up a dataset, create elaborate plots, analyze and summarize the data, and produce presentable reports. Throughout the final project, we will learn to extract value from data by asking the right questions and using the appropriate analytical methods and tools. These methods comprise data preprocessing, explanatory analysis, and machine learning techniques. Prior programming experience in Python is required.\nIntroduction to Data Analytics in Python\nIntroduction to Data Analytics in Python\nCOURSE CODE: is833\nThis course will introduce students to programming-based tools and techniques for becoming analytically-minded managers.

While it is often assumed that the government should handle these issues, government leadership is frequently lacking, shifting the responsibility to the private sector to prevent systemic collapse.\nThe Full-Time Social Impact MBA, integrated with Questrom’s general MBA program, offers the same core business courses and degree, but with specialized knowledge and skills for the social impact space. You will learn how non-profit and for-profit organizations and investors can grow and sustain their operations while strengthening, rather than undermining, the systems they operate within. This is crucial, as these organizations play a vital role in addressing major societal challenges such as climate change, poverty, inequality, and global health.\nThe Full-Time Social Impact program attracts students who are passionate about business as a force for good. You’ll join a vibrant, impact-driven community and develop lifelong bonds with your classmates who come from an enormous range of backgrounds. Gain leadership skills, case study insights, and one-on-one development—all tailored to your impact-driven goals.\nThe mission of the Social Impact MBA closely aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Specifically, the aim of our program is to develop responsible leaders (of start-ups, established firms, and both for- and non-profit organizations) who create innovative products, services, and business models that help address vital social challenges — such as climate change, food security, global health, poverty, discrimination, etc. — and enable them to grow and sustain their organizations over time.\nQuestrom Social Impact MBA students are among the very best and brightest MBA students, nurturing a vibrant and inclusive learning community. Our students’ cultural and professional backgrounds, as well as their job aspirations, are very diverse. What unites them is a strong passion for creating positive change and showing leadership in tackling society’s most urgent environmental, economic, and social challenges.\nWe’ll connect you right away with alumni and other top professionals ready to support and guide you through our Social Impact MBA program. After you graduate, you’ll become part of our vibrant alumni network you can rely on throughout your career.\n“Questrom is aiming to prepare those of us working in the for-profit world to think about the potential for socially responsible success in a whole new light.”\nFull-Time MBA\nHEAD OF B2B, COME BIEN\nIn addition to the academic and extracurricular experiences that are available to all Full-Time MBA students, our Social Impact students also participate in student clubs, case competitions, and service activities that are specifically focused on social impact.\nLink Day is a Questrom tradition everyone looks forward to. And one way we give back to the Greater Boston community. Link Day is a one-day consulting event that matches mission-driven organizations with teams of Questrom faculty and MBA students—including Social Impact students—to help solve business-related challenges for local nonprofits and social enterprises. Students gets hands-on practice. Organizations get new solutions and ideas. That’s what we call win-win!\nHow do organizations develop innovative products and services that act as sustainable solutions to social challenges? Students tackle these issues by doing a consulting project for a client from a host country and then present their recommendation to the client in person. Recent trips include South Africa and Brazil.\nAs a Social Impact MBA, you’ll have the chance to influence meaningful change during your internship with a leading company, startup, social enterprise, government, or nonprofit.\nSocial Impact MBA students are welcomed to get involved with Susilo Institute, a thought leader and platform for ethical business actions and responsible leadership with a global perspective. The Institute produces original research, offers courses, and hosts conference, guest speakers, and events for students, faculty, partner organizations, governments, alumni, and the public.\nSocial Impact MBA students are welcomed to get involved with the BU Institute for Global Sustainability, a university-wide center dedicated to developing energy systems that will provide abundant, universally accessible, and sustainable energy sources for emerging and advanced economies.\nWe have over 25 different student clubs and organizations, and over 60% of students get involved. Many Social Impact students are active in the following:\nMany Social Impact students are active in Net Impact, Questrom’s graduate chapter of an international network of students and professionals motivated to improve the world through responsible management and sustainable practices.\nSINC, the student-run Social Impact and Nonprofit Club brings panel discussions, networking opportunities, social events, and other activities to Questrom to will help students become socially-minded leaders in both the public and private sectors.\nWhether you aspire to work in sustainable finance, impact investing, responsible for-profit business, or nonprofit and public management, Questrom’s Social Impact MBA program gives you the opportunity to gain crucial business skills that allow you to create positive social change. You will learn the full array of business fundamentals and—on top of that—you will be able to specialize in areas such as social entrepreneurship, sustainable energy and environment, global health, sustainable development, clean energy, impact investing, and public sector management. In addition to all of the great career resources we provide to all full-time MBA students, Social Impact MBA students will engage directly with academic experts and industry leaders in the social impact space through global field seminars, consulting projects, case competitions, guest speakers, classroom activities, and more.\nDo you aspire to pursue a career that allows you to make a positive social impact and address vital challenges such as climate change, global health, inequality, and poverty?Social Impact students have access to the full range of the MBA curriculum. We are happy to help design a career pathway that aligns with your career goals. We offer elective courses that help students develop their skills and knowledge in each of these areas. Here are a few pathways that our Social Impact students have pursued:\nOur students secure employment at all types of leading non-profit and for-profit organizations. Organizations that have recently hired Social Impact students for internships and permanent employment include:\nBecause the Social Impact MBA is a specialization within the Full-Time MBA program, they share the same curriculum. By adding the social impact specialization, however, you’ll be able to focus your MBA degree with our Social Impact targeted electives. Students must take 1 required course and choose 3 additional Social Impact electives in order to earn the Social Impact specialization.\nThe required Social Impact course:\nCOURSE CODE: sr801\nThis course explores the relationship between corporations, society, and the natural environment. Specifically, it examines the ways in which governments, corporations and civil society (fail to) have positive impact and manage issues where the pursuit of private goals is deemed inconsistent with the public interest. There are two modules to the course: (1) The first module examines these issues and the tensions that arise between the different stakeholders. In particular, we will discuss different types of market failures (due to negative externalities, imperfect information, public goods, and market control) and their impact on the natural and social environment. (2) The second module explores how (non-profit and for-profit) organizations can take private actions to mitigate the previously identified market failures and respond to the increasing pressure to address environmental and social issues through the adoption of sustainable business practices. This course is ideal for any student interested in social impact such as corporate social responsibility, environmental sustainability, nonprofit & public management, sustainable finance & responsible investment, social entrepreneurship, global health, and clean technology & sustainable energy. It is open to all full-time MBA and PEMBA students, and it is the foundational course for students in the Social Impact MBA program.\nFull-Time MBA students at Questrom have choices—10 electives within the program to be exact. Social Impact MBA students are only required to take 4 social impact courses (1 required and 3 elective courses) and may use the additional 6 electives as they wish. You can either take additional social impact electives, pursue another concentration altogether, or explore any elective we offer that fits your interests.\nHere’s a sample of some of the Social Impact electives you’ll be able to choose from:\nCOURSE CODE: ac831\nThe course addresses sustainability reporting. We will examine the evolving protocols for such disclosure: Integrated Reporting, Sustainability Accounting Standards,\r\nGreenhouse Gas Emissions, Carbon Disclosure Project, and the Global Reporting Initiative. Students will learn about the range of sustainability disclosures, develop an\r\nability to think critically about them and gain knowledge about the challenges of implementing them\nCOURSE CODE: fe833\nESG Equity Investing is an introductory course that provides the appropriate tools to analyze and undertake investments in publicly listed companies taking into account the social impact of these financial decisions. Different dimensions of social impact – Environment, Social, and Governance – are discussed along with corresponding ESG metrics available to investors. The core of the course deals with the integration of (quantitative-based) portfolio allocation models with (qualitative-based) ESG scores and objectives. The course also discusses how impact investing may affect the behavior of firms, as well as alternative channels through which investors can provide impact (private investments, activism).\nCOURSE CODE: hm703\nThis course provides a dynamic introduction to the health sector, beginning with the burden and distribution of disease and current patterns of expenditures.  While the emphasis will be on the American system, a global context will be developed.  The basic elements of insurance and payment, service delivery, and life sciences products will be described, and put in the context of the unique economic structure of the sector.  The intense challenges of the sector will be explored, as well as both the ethical issues presented and the opportunities that emerge.  Public policy and technological and practice development as drivers of change will be addressed throughout.\nCOURSE CODE: im860\nThis course provides an action-based learning experience for students interested in understanding how for-profit and non-profit organizations develop innovative products and services that help mitigate grand challenges such as climate change, food security, global health, and poverty, and enable them to grow their business and sustain their competitive advantage over time.  Students will work on a live 'social impact' consulting project for a client from the host country, and present their recommendation to the client while in the country.  Furthermore, students will visit and interact with various players in the social impact sector (e.g., entrepreneurs, high-level executives, non-profit leaders) to learn about the opportunities and challenges they face. This course is ideal for students interested in social impact, sustainable energy, environmental sustainability, social entrepreneurship, socially responsible investing (SRI), and global health and healthcare.\nCOURSE CODE: mk838\nEvery organization – be it government, private company or welfare agency – is in the business of changing behavior.  In this course, students will learn to apply insights from behavioral economics to effectively produce it.  In teams, students will: (1) translate a real-time business or policy challenge into a specific behavior change project; (2) use the frameworks presented in class along with research from economics, psychology, marketing, and other related disciplines to develop possible interventions and/or frameworks for addressing the challenge; and (3) audit the decision-making process of various stakeholders to identify pain points and opportunities for behavior change. Previous organizations include Warby Parker, the World Bank, and FCLT Global.\nCOURSE CODE: mk867\nGlobalization, increasing transparency in business operations and the prevalence of social media have forever changed the way stakeholders view and interact with organizations.  Societal and business imperatives are not only often considered compatible; they can be increasingly viewed as one and the same. People today often communicate, organize and engage based on mutual interests, and, generally, place  greater trust in organizations and individuals that work for a better world. Marketing has often been referred to as the “science of sales.” Whether you are selling a product, an intervention or an idea, it can be a powerful tool for advancing social change in today’s dynamic environment. The strategic integration of a relevant social purpose into a product, business or nonprofit organization through brand-building citizenship activities can drive consumer and donor recall, consideration, acquisition, retention and propensity to recommend. However, these efforts do not usually constitute a “silver bullet” and may not be the best solution to a business problem or societal need at all. In the worst cases, ill-conceived citizenship marketing strategies can result in damaging consequences.  Practitioners must be pragmatic when engaging in marketing social change. Understanding how to apply best practice, identify opportunities, address challenges, engage stakeholders and innovate strategically are essential skills in this rapidly evolving sector. The purpose of this course is to provide students with an in-depth understanding of how marketing principles can be applied to create both short-term and lasting social change. Students will explore dimensions of the modern landscapes of brand, corporate and nonprofit “citizenship” and how they relate to marketing. Areas of study include: cause-related marketing and cause branding; nonprofit branding and social movements, as well as corporate social responsibility and shared value creation.\nCOURSE CODE: mo830\nMission-driven organizations are created in order to accomplish goals that  extend  beyond profits for stakeholders and owners. Missions vary, ranging  from, among many  others, improving health care, providing meaningful work  opportunities, educating  or protecting youth, safeguarding the planet,  eradicating poverty, building  sustainable organizations, and enabling  spirituality. Such missions occur in the  context of various organizations,  including non-profit and for-profit,  philanthropic and religious, public  and private, governmental and non-governmental.  This course focuses on  leadership theories, frameworks, and practices that take  seriously the  nature of workers, including both professional staff and volunteers,  and  their reasons for choosing to work in such organizations. This course is   designed to build the capacities of students to use specific tools related  to  leadership, conflict, and change that are particularly useful in leading  mission- driven organizations, and enable them to develop particular  insights about specific  mission-driven organizations of interest, related  to their effectiveness and  capacities for change.\nCOURSE CODE: mo833\nThis course will provide students with an in-depth understanding of the structure and governance of executive compensation programs and practices.  The course material will draw upon the theory and research in executive compensation and explore current legislative and shareholder reform initiatives impacting executive pay.  Our approach will be to view executive compensation from a multi-stakeholder perspective taking into account the interests of shareholders, institutional investors, advocacy groups, social activists, governmental regulators, employees, and executives.  We will examine the linkages between executive compensation and business strategy, talent strategy, compliance with securities law, tax regulations, accounting standards, and principles of good corporate governance.  We will also address current topics of gender pay equity, increasing pay inequality, and investor focus on the role of incentives in reinforcing organizational attention to environmental, social and governance issues (ESG). While the primary focus of the course will be on executive and management compensation, the theory and practice applicable to broad-based rewards programs will also be explored.\nCOURSE CODE: mo848\nThis course examines the essence of leadership; its relationship to  managing; and the behaviors, attitudes and perspectives that distinguish  leaders.  Leadership is considered in a variety of ways: leadership in  crises, at the top, in the middle, and in groups.  Case studies, students'  past experiences, instruments, and other learning activities provide  opportunities for students to assess and develop their leadership talents.\nCOURSE CODE: om832\nBlockchain technology is transforming societies by decentralizing institutional systems and reducing the need for intermediaries.  This course aims to help students understand blockchain technology and the unique business models it enables in various industries.  Students will learn how blockchains work, and how their properties enable business models that have never previously been possible.  Through an analysis of current programs with existing use cases as well as future models, the course will prepare students to implement models today while anticipating the changes that newer models will bring to the sector\nCOURSE CODE: om851\nThis course examines supply chain practices that reduce environmental impact for a firm These include eco-efficiency initiatives such as reduction in waste, energy and water usage, green logistics, product design for recycling, and supplier management. It covers additional topics such as complexity of supply chains, environmental impact assessment, the circular economy, food waste, eco-labeling, and sustainable business models (e.g., through servicing).\nCOURSE CODE: si836\nThe changing relationship between business and the natural environment offers both challenges and opportunities for firms. In this course we will discuss many facets of business, including financing, risk management, measurement, competitive positioning, innovation, and strategy in the context of increasing pressures for improved environmental sustainability. The course will be interactive and discussion-oriented, with a case discussion in most class sessions, supplemented by debates, simulation exercises, visitors, student presentations, discussions of recent news articles, and mini-lectures. The course is appropriate for all students interested in how demands for sustainability will continue to change the business environment.\nCOURSE CODE: si849\nCorporate Sustainability Strategy is an advanced corporate-level strategy course that explores such varied issues as the underpinnings, interconnectedness and systems dynamics of human-coupled natural ecosystems, limits to growth and the increasing influence of climate change, environmental degradation and natural resource depletion on the corporate strategy, industrial development and the global economy.  \r\n\r\nSpecifically, this course:\r\n\r\n1)\tApplies situational analysis techniques and methods to macro-level social, economic and environmental systems and their driving forces,\r\n2)\tEvaluates a variety of strategic planning/forecasting tools, methods and techniques, \r\n3)\tInvestigates decision frameworks for corporate strategy focused on creating/capturing value and risk management through a sequence of action over time,\r\n4)\tExplores new emerging paradigms for product/service, business model, structural and financial innovations, \r\n5)\tIdentifies new opportunities/challenges for innovation and value creation/capture through collaborations and competition, partnerships/alliances/consortia and platforms.  \r\n\r\nThe course takes the perspective of the corporate leader/strategy analyst and challenges students to identify driving forces, evaluate global trends, understand implications and assess their impact on strategies, objectives, operations and performance of the firm.\r\n\r\nGSM SI849 replaces GSM PL849; students who took PL849 may not take SI849.\nCOURSE CODE: si852\nThis course focuses on the process of identifying and obtaining the necessary resources to launch an entrepreneurial venture through the development of a business plan. A well-written business plan will communicate the business concept in a way that attracts the various resource providers necessary for the venture's success. Students will individually develop a business concept and prepare and present a professional business plan.\nCOURSE CODE: sr841\nThe purpose of this course is to teach students about the distinctive  challenges of  managing high-performing organizations in the nonprofit  sector.  The course will  cover a broad range of topics and it is intended  to be a gateway course to the  sector and to potential electives and  pathways of future learning.  The two major  projects in the semester (one  is individual, one in a team) offer students the  chance to choose an area  of interest to explore in depth.  Other assignments  challenge students to  identify and analyze key indicators of nonprofit performance  and to  communicate effectively about those issues to selected stakeholders.  A   strong grounding in nonprofit accounting and financial management is  extremely  valuable and so we devote considerable attention to those topics.   The course also  addresses nonprofit marketing, evaluation, fundraising and  revenue generation,  growth strategy, impact investing, and the confluence  of charity and commerce.  The  course is oriented to practice and will  engage experts in the field.\nCOURSE CODE: pl855\nThis course is designed as a multi-dimensional approach to understanding the energy sector. This includes production, development, distribution, financing, and consumption relating to the two distinct sectors – Power Generation and Transportation, both domestically and internationally. For Power Generation, we will explore the fundamentals of Generation, Transmission (G&T), and Distribution as well as major feedstocks, including wind, solar, nuclear, natural gas, and coal. This includes an in-depth discussion of both challenges and opportunities inherent to altering the current system.\nCOURSE CODE: sr850\nThis course is designed to: (1) explore the concepts, practices, opportunities, and challenges of social entrepreneurship; (2) provide frameworks and tools that will help students be more effective in this sector; and (3) provide an opportunity for students to create a business plan for a new social enterprise or an income-generating initiative of a nonprofit organization. In the business plan project, student teams will partner with external organizations. Students will identify and analyze opportunities, resources, and risks and apply skills from marketing, accounting, organizational behavior, strategy and other disciplines. Special emphasis will be placed on aspects of business planning and organizational strategy that are particularly challenging or distinctive in the social sector, including mission definition, leadership, organizational structure, raising capital, and measuring results.\n*Courses MK838, MO833, SI852 may count toward the Social Impact MBA elective requirement if the student completes a project in the course that is directly related to the social impact sector.\nFriday, August 8\nSaturday, August 9\nTuesday, August 12\nReady to apply?

While it is often assumed that the government should handle these issues, government leadership is frequently lacking, shifting the responsibility to the private sector to prevent systemic collapse.\nThe Full-Time Social Impact MBA, integrated with Questrom’s general MBA program, offers the same core business courses and degree, but with specialized knowledge and skills for the social impact space. You will learn how non-profit and for-profit organizations and investors can grow and sustain their operations while strengthening, rather than undermining, the systems they operate within. This is crucial, as these organizations play a vital role in addressing major societal challenges such as climate change, poverty, inequality, and global health.\nPlay with\n                    \n                  sound\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Full-Time Social Impact program attracts students who are passionate about business as a force for good.

Specifically, it examines the ways in which governments, corporations and civil society (fail to) have positive impact and manage issues where the pursuit of private goals is deemed inconsistent with the public interest. There are two modules to the course: (1) The first module examines these issues and the tensions that arise between the different stakeholders. In particular, we will discuss different types of market failures (due to negative externalities, imperfect information, public goods, and market control) and their impact on the natural and social environment. (2) The second module explores how (non-profit and for-profit) organizations can take private actions to mitigate the previously identified market failures and respond to the increasing pressure to address environmental and social issues through the adoption of sustainable business practices. This course is ideal for any student interested in social impact such as corporate social responsibility, environmental sustainability, nonprofit & public management, sustainable finance & responsible investment, social entrepreneurship, global health, and clean technology & sustainable energy. It is open to all full-time MBA and PEMBA students, and it is the foundational course for students in the Social Impact MBA program.\nSocial Impact: Business, Society, and the Natural Environment\n\n\n\nCOURSE CODE: sr801\nThis course explores the relationship between corporations, society, and the natural environment.

Students will learn about the range of sustainability disclosures, develop an\r\nability to think critically about them and gain knowledge about the challenges of implementing them\n\n\n\n\n\n\nESG Equity Investing\n\n\n\nCOURSE CODE: fe833\nESG Equity Investing is an introductory course that provides the appropriate tools to analyze and undertake investments in publicly listed companies taking into account the social impact of these financial decisions. Different dimensions of social impact – Environment, Social, and Governance – are discussed along with corresponding ESG metrics available to investors. The core of the course deals with the integration of (quantitative-based) portfolio allocation models with (qualitative-based) ESG scores and objectives. The course also discusses how impact investing may affect the behavior of firms, as well as alternative channels through which investors can provide impact (private investments, activism). \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth Sector Issues and Opportunities\n\n\n\nCOURSE CODE: hm703\nThis course provides a dynamic introduction to the health sector, beginning with the burden and distribution of disease and current patterns of expenditures.  While the emphasis will be on the American system, a global context will be developed.  The basic elements of insurance and payment, service delivery, and life sciences products will be described, and put in the context of the unique economic structure of the sector.  The intense challenges of the sector will be explored, as well as both the ethical issues presented and the opportunities that emerge.  Public policy and technological and practice development as drivers of change will be addressed throughout.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial Impact Field Seminar\n\n\n\nCOURSE CODE: im860\nThis course provides an action-based learning experience for students interested in understanding how for-profit and non-profit organizations develop innovative products and services that help mitigate grand challenges such as climate change, food security, global health, and poverty, and enable them to grow their business and sustain their competitive advantage over time.  Students will work on a live 'social impact' consulting project for a client from the host country, and present their recommendation to the client while in the country.  Furthermore, students will visit and interact with various players in the social impact sector (e.g., entrepreneurs, high-level executives, non-profit leaders) to learn about the opportunities and challenges they face. This course is ideal for students interested in social impact, sustainable energy, environmental sustainability, social entrepreneurship, socially responsible investing (SRI), and global health and healthcare.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBehavior Change Practicum\n\n\n\nCOURSE CODE: mk838\nEvery organization – be it government, private company or welfare agency – is in the business of changing behavior.  In this course, students will learn to apply insights from behavioral economics to effectively produce it.  In teams, students will: (1) translate a real-time business or policy challenge into a specific behavior change project; (2) use the frameworks presented in class along with research from economics, psychology, marketing, and other related disciplines to develop possible interventions and/or frameworks for addressing the challenge; and (3) audit the decision-making process of various stakeholders to identify pain points and opportunities for behavior change. Previous organizations include Warby Parker, the World Bank, and FCLT Global.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurpose-Led Marketing\n\n\n\nCOURSE CODE: mk867\nGlobalization, increasing transparency in business operations and the prevalence of social media have forever changed the way stakeholders view and interact with organizations.  Societal and business imperatives are not only often considered compatible; they can be increasingly viewed as one and the same. People today often communicate, organize and engage based on mutual interests, and, generally, place  greater trust in organizations and individuals that work for a better world. Marketing has often been referred to as the “science of sales.” Whether you are selling a product, an intervention or an idea, it can be a powerful tool for advancing social change in today’s dynamic environment. The strategic integration of a relevant social purpose into a product, business or nonprofit organization through brand-building citizenship activities can drive consumer and donor recall, consideration, acquisition, retention and propensity to recommend. However, these efforts do not usually constitute a “silver bullet” and may not be the best solution to a business problem or societal need at all. In the worst cases, ill-conceived citizenship marketing strategies can result in damaging consequences.  Practitioners must be pragmatic when engaging in marketing social change. Understanding how to apply best practice, identify opportunities, address challenges, engage stakeholders and innovate strategically are essential skills in this rapidly evolving sector. The purpose of this course is to provide students with an in-depth understanding of how marketing principles can be applied to create both short-term and lasting social change. Students will explore dimensions of the modern landscapes of brand, corporate and nonprofit “citizenship” and how they relate to marketing. Areas of study include: cause-related marketing and cause branding; nonprofit branding and social movements, as well as corporate social responsibility and shared value creation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeading Mission Driven Organizations\n\n\n\nCOURSE CODE: mo830\nMission-driven organizations are created in order to accomplish goals that  extend  beyond profits for stakeholders and owners. Missions vary, ranging  from, among many  others, improving health care, providing meaningful work  opportunities, educating  or protecting youth, safeguarding the planet,  eradicating poverty, building  sustainable organizations, and enabling  spirituality. Such missions occur in the  context of various organizations,  including non-profit and for-profit,  philanthropic and religious, public  and private, governmental and non-governmental.  This course focuses on  leadership theories, frameworks, and practices that take  seriously the  nature of workers, including both professional staff and volunteers,  and  their reasons for choosing to work in such organizations. This course is   designed to build the capacities of students to use specific tools related  to  leadership, conflict, and change that are particularly useful in leading  mission- driven organizations, and enable them to develop particular  insights about specific  mission-driven organizations of interest, related  to their effectiveness and  capacities for change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExecutive Compensation: Strategy and Practice\n\n\n\nCOURSE CODE: mo833\nThis course will provide students with an in-depth understanding of the structure and governance of executive compensation programs and practices.  The course material will draw upon the theory and research in executive compensation and explore current legislative and shareholder reform initiatives impacting executive pay.  Our approach will be to view executive compensation from a multi-stakeholder perspective taking into account the interests of shareholders, institutional investors, advocacy groups, social activists, governmental regulators, employees, and executives.  We will examine the linkages between executive compensation and business strategy, talent strategy, compliance with securities law, tax regulations, accounting standards, and principles of good corporate governance.  We will also address current topics of gender pay equity, increasing pay inequality, and investor focus on the role of incentives in reinforcing organizational attention to environmental, social and governance issues (ESG). While the primary focus of the course will be on executive and management compensation, the theory and practice applicable to broad-based rewards programs will also be explored.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeadership Challenge\n\n\n\nCOURSE CODE: mo848\nThis course examines the essence of leadership; its relationship to  managing; and the behaviors, attitudes and perspectives that distinguish  leaders.  Leadership is considered in a variety of ways: leadership in  crises, at the top, in the middle, and in groups.  Case studies, students'  past experiences, instruments, and other learning activities provide  opportunities for students to assess and develop their leadership talents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlockchain and Social Impact\n\n\n\nCOURSE CODE: om832\nBlockchain technology is transforming societies by decentralizing institutional systems and reducing the need for intermediaries.  This course aims to help students understand blockchain technology and the unique business models it enables in various industries.  Students will learn how blockchains work, and how their properties enable business models that have never previously been possible.  Through an analysis of current programs with existing use cases as well as future models, the course will prepare students to implement models today while anticipating the changes that newer models will bring to the sector\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironmentally Sustainable Supply Chains\n\n\n\nCOURSE CODE: om851\nThis course examines supply chain practices that reduce environmental impact for a firm These include eco-efficiency initiatives such as reduction in waste, energy and water usage, green logistics, product design for recycling, and supplier management. It covers additional topics such as complexity of supply chains, environmental impact assessment, the circular economy, food waste, eco-labeling, and sustainable business models (e.g., through servicing).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecarbonization of the Global Economy\n\n\n\nCOURSE CODE: si836\nThe changing relationship between business and the natural environment offers both challenges and opportunities for firms. In this course we will discuss many facets of business, including financing, risk management, measurement, competitive positioning, innovation, and strategy in the context of increasing pressures for improved environmental sustainability. The course will be interactive and discussion-oriented, with a case discussion in most class sessions, supplemented by debates, simulation exercises, visitors, student presentations, discussions of recent news articles, and mini-lectures. The course is appropriate for all students interested in how demands for sustainability will continue to change the business environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Sustainability Strategy\n\n\n\nCOURSE CODE: si849\nCorporate Sustainability Strategy is an advanced corporate-level strategy course that explores such varied issues as the underpinnings, interconnectedness and systems dynamics of human-coupled natural ecosystems, limits to growth and the increasing influence of climate change, environmental degradation and natural resource depletion on the corporate strategy, industrial development and the global economy.  \r\n\r\nSpecifically, this course:\r\n\r\n1)\tApplies situational analysis techniques and methods to macro-level social, economic and environmental systems and their driving forces,\r\n2)\tEvaluates a variety of strategic planning/forecasting tools, methods and techniques, \r\n3)\tInvestigates decision frameworks for corporate strategy focused on creating/capturing value and risk management through a sequence of action over time,\r\n4)\tExplores new emerging paradigms for product/service, business model, structural and financial innovations, \r\n5)\tIdentifies new opportunities/challenges for innovation and value creation/capture through collaborations and competition, partnerships/alliances/consortia and platforms.  \r\n\r\nThe course takes the perspective of the corporate leader/strategy analyst and challenges students to identify driving forces, evaluate global trends, understand implications and assess their impact on strategies, objectives, operations and performance of the firm.\r\n\r\nGSM SI849 replaces GSM PL849; students who took PL849 may not take SI849.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStarting New Ventures\n\n\n\nCOURSE CODE: si852\nThis course focuses on the process of identifying and obtaining the necessary resources to launch an entrepreneurial venture through the development of a business plan. A well-written business plan will communicate the business concept in a way that attracts the various resource providers necessary for the venture's success. Students will individually develop a business concept and prepare and present a professional business plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFundamentals of Nonprofit Management\n\n\n\nCOURSE CODE: sr841\nThe purpose of this course is to teach students about the distinctive  challenges of  managing high-performing organizations in the nonprofit  sector.  The course will  cover a broad range of topics and it is intended  to be a gateway course to the  sector and to potential electives and  pathways of future learning.  The two major  projects in the semester (one  is individual, one in a team) offer students the  chance to choose an area  of interest to explore in depth.  Other assignments  challenge students to  identify and analyze key indicators of nonprofit performance  and to  communicate effectively about those issues to selected stakeholders.  A   strong grounding in nonprofit accounting and financial management is  extremely  valuable and so we devote considerable attention to those topics.   The course also  addresses nonprofit marketing, evaluation, fundraising and  revenue generation,  growth strategy, impact investing, and the confluence  of charity and commerce.  The  course is oriented to practice and will  engage experts in the field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnergy Sector Market Dynamics\n\n\n\nCOURSE CODE: pl855\nThis course is designed as a multi-dimensional approach to understanding the energy sector. This includes production, development, distribution, financing, and consumption relating to the two distinct sectors – Power Generation and Transportation, both domestically and internationally. For Power Generation, we will explore the fundamentals of Generation, Transmission (G&T), and Distribution as well as major feedstocks, including wind, solar, nuclear, natural gas, and coal. This includes an in-depth discussion of both challenges and opportunities inherent to altering the current system. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Entrepreneurship\n\n\n\nCOURSE CODE: sr850\nThis course is designed to: (1) explore the concepts, practices, opportunities, and challenges of social entrepreneurship; (2) provide frameworks and tools that will help students be more effective in this sector; and (3) provide an opportunity for students to create a business plan for a new social enterprise or an income-generating initiative of a nonprofit organization. In the business plan project, student teams will partner with external organizations. Students will identify and analyze opportunities, resources, and risks and apply skills from marketing, accounting, organizational behavior, strategy and other disciplines. Special emphasis will be placed on aspects of business planning and organizational strategy that are particularly challenging or distinctive in the social sector, including mission definition, leadership, organizational structure, raising capital, and measuring results.\nSustainability Reporting\n\n\n\nCOURSE CODE: ac831\nThe course addresses sustainability reporting.

Societal and business imperatives are not only often considered compatible; they can be increasingly viewed as one and the same. People today often communicate, organize and engage based on mutual interests, and, generally, place  greater trust in organizations and individuals that work for a better world. Marketing has often been referred to as the “science of sales.” Whether you are selling a product, an intervention or an idea, it can be a powerful tool for advancing social change in today’s dynamic environment. The strategic integration of a relevant social purpose into a product, business or nonprofit organization through brand-building citizenship activities can drive consumer and donor recall, consideration, acquisition, retention and propensity to recommend. However, these efforts do not usually constitute a “silver bullet” and may not be the best solution to a business problem or societal need at all. In the worst cases, ill-conceived citizenship marketing strategies can result in damaging consequences.  Practitioners must be pragmatic when engaging in marketing social change. Understanding how to apply best practice, identify opportunities, address challenges, engage stakeholders and innovate strategically are essential skills in this rapidly evolving sector. The purpose of this course is to provide students with an in-depth understanding of how marketing principles can be applied to create both short-term and lasting social change. Students will explore dimensions of the modern landscapes of brand, corporate and nonprofit “citizenship” and how they relate to marketing. Areas of study include: cause-related marketing and cause branding; nonprofit branding and social movements, as well as corporate social responsibility and shared value creation.\nPurpose-Led Marketing\nPurpose-Led Marketing\nCOURSE CODE: mk867\nGlobalization, increasing transparency in business operations and the prevalence of social media have forever changed the way stakeholders view and interact with organizations.

Societal and business imperatives are not only often considered compatible; they can be increasingly viewed as one and the same. People today often communicate, organize and engage based on mutual interests, and, generally, place  greater trust in organizations and individuals that work for a better world. Marketing has often been referred to as the “science of sales.” Whether you are selling a product, an intervention or an idea, it can be a powerful tool for advancing social change in today’s dynamic environment. The strategic integration of a relevant social purpose into a product, business or nonprofit organization through brand-building citizenship activities can drive consumer and donor recall, consideration, acquisition, retention and propensity to recommend. However, these efforts do not usually constitute a “silver bullet” and may not be the best solution to a business problem or societal need at all. In the worst cases, ill-conceived citizenship marketing strategies can result in damaging consequences.  Practitioners must be pragmatic when engaging in marketing social change. Understanding how to apply best practice, identify opportunities, address challenges, engage stakeholders and innovate strategically are essential skills in this rapidly evolving sector. The purpose of this course is to provide students with an in-depth understanding of how marketing principles can be applied to create both short-term and lasting social change. Students will explore dimensions of the modern landscapes of brand, corporate and nonprofit “citizenship” and how they relate to marketing. Areas of study include: cause-related marketing and cause branding; nonprofit branding and social movements, as well as corporate social responsibility and shared value creation.\nPurpose-Led Marketing\nPurpose-Led Marketing\nCOURSE CODE: mk867\nGlobalization, increasing transparency in business operations and the prevalence of social media have forever changed the way stakeholders view and interact with organizations.

Societal and business imperatives are not only often considered compatible; they can be increasingly viewed as one and the same. People today often communicate, organize and engage based on mutual interests, and, generally, place  greater trust in organizations and individuals that work for a better world. Marketing has often been referred to as the “science of sales.” Whether you are selling a product, an intervention or an idea, it can be a powerful tool for advancing social change in today’s dynamic environment. The strategic integration of a relevant social purpose into a product, business or nonprofit organization through brand-building citizenship activities can drive consumer and donor recall, consideration, acquisition, retention and propensity to recommend. However, these efforts do not usually constitute a “silver bullet” and may not be the best solution to a business problem or societal need at all. In the worst cases, ill-conceived citizenship marketing strategies can result in damaging consequences.  Practitioners must be pragmatic when engaging in marketing social change. Understanding how to apply best practice, identify opportunities, address challenges, engage stakeholders and innovate strategically are essential skills in this rapidly evolving sector. The purpose of this course is to provide students with an in-depth understanding of how marketing principles can be applied to create both short-term and lasting social change. Students will explore dimensions of the modern landscapes of brand, corporate and nonprofit “citizenship” and how they relate to marketing. Areas of study include: cause-related marketing and cause branding; nonprofit branding and social movements, as well as corporate social responsibility and shared value creation.\nCOURSE CODE: mk867\nGlobalization, increasing transparency in business operations and the prevalence of social media have forever changed the way stakeholders view and interact with organizations.

The course will  cover a broad range of topics and it is intended  to be a gateway course to the  sector and to potential electives and  pathways of future learning.  The two major  projects in the semester (one  is individual, one in a team) offer students the  chance to choose an area  of interest to explore in depth.  Other assignments  challenge students to  identify and analyze key indicators of nonprofit performance  and to  communicate effectively about those issues to selected stakeholders.  A   strong grounding in nonprofit accounting and financial management is  extremely  valuable and so we devote considerable attention to those topics.   The course also  addresses nonprofit marketing, evaluation, fundraising and  revenue generation,  growth strategy, impact investing, and the confluence  of charity and commerce.  The  course is oriented to practice and will  engage experts in the field.\nCOURSE CODE: sr841\nThe purpose of this course is to teach students about the distinctive  challenges of  managing high-performing organizations in the nonprofit  sector.

The Health Sector MBA program will prepare you to lead in this fast-growing industry no matter which path you take.\nBoston is a national leader in health and life sciences research and discovery. Ranked #1 among U.S. biopharma clusters and home to world-class academic medical centers, the city drives innovation in the field. Questrom’s Health Sector Full-Time MBA (HSM) connects you to it all. Ranked Top 5 in healthcare management (U.S. News 2019), Questrom ensures you gain the expertise to make an impact. Whether you’re focused on health services, biotech, pharma, medical devices, or diagnostics, the Health Sector MBA equips you to lead in this rapidly growing industry.\nQuestrom was among the first business schools to recognize the MBA as the ideal path for healthcare and biopharma leadership. Since 1972, the HSM program has provided students with the education and hands-on experience needed to excel in the health sector through an innovative curriculum, intensive skills training, and global learning opportunities.\nQuestrom is home to some of the nation’s top health sector researchers and practitioners. In fact, over 40 of the 160+ Questrom faculty members have research, specific interest, or industry experience in the health sector. Your HSM professors will bring their expertise directly to you in the classroom every day, covering everything from healthcare delivery to drugs, devices and diagnostics. They’ll also make sure you’re on top of industry trends like new market forces, consumer-driven healthcare, cost sensitivity, and new policies impacting the healthcare and biopharma regulatory ecosystem.\nThe Health Sector MBA community is a tight-knit group. Our students come from all over the globe and have backgrounds in everything from healthcare to biopharma to marketing to finance. At Questrom, everyone is here to challenge themselves and learn from each other. Diversity is valued. So is teamwork. This is Questrom—globally minded, socially conscious, ethical people determined to use their MBAs to create value and lead positive change.\nMeet a few of our Full-Time Health Sector MBA students.\nWe’ll connect you right away with alumni and other top professionals ready to support and guide you through our Health Sector Mentoring Program. After you graduate, you’ll become part of our vibrant HSM alumni network—more than 2,000 professionals you can rely on throughout your career.\n“The faculty here are so plugged in. They are wonderful at introducing students to their contacts, which range from pharmaceutical companies to the department of public health.”\nCONSULTANT AT VANTAGE PARTNERS\nHear from Full-Time MBA Health Sector MBA student Simona Gilman, who found the ideal program at Questrom to break into pharma, expand her network, and learn from a diverse group of classmates with unique backgrounds and expertise.\nApply what you learn in the classroom to work in the real world right away—creating positive outcomes while you’re still a student. In addition to gaining the same valuable hands-on academic experience as our Full-Time MBA students through summer internships and global immersion courses, our health sector students also participate in HSM-specific student clubs, case competitions, and student treks.\nHSM students can participate in our annual student-led health and life sciences conference or design a health sector-related student trek. Best of all, you’ll study and learn in the center of the world-class Boston health sector scene, collaborating with leaders in the nation’s premier center of health and life sciences.\nQuestrom’s Health & Life Sciences Conference is an annual, student-organized event that brings together more than 250 diverse students and professionals across all sectors of the U.S. healthcare industry for valuable networking and comprehensive programming spanning healthcare delivery and hospitals to pharmaceuticals and medical devices.\nAdventure awaits! Join a team of students to design your own health sector trek or hop on a trip that’s already planned. Instead of class deliverables, you’ll focus on a concept, place, or health sector project you invent yourself. The location is up to you! Treks last one or two weeks and have gone to Guatemala to assist budding entrepreneurs and Israel to focus on innovation. Where will you travel to make a difference?\nWe have over 25 different student clubs and organizations, and over 60% of students get involved. Here are a few options specifically for HSM students.\nMany Health Sector students are involved in the student-run Health Sector Management Club which focuses on building a sense of community for all MBA students enrolled in or interested in Health Sector Management by providing educational, professional development, and social events. The group hosts company treks, networking sessions, and panels.\nThe HSM program has an extensive Health Sector Mentoring Program, which connects you with alumni and other professionals who will support and guide you through your time at Questrom.\nThe healthcare and biopharma industries are growing—and hiring. In Boston, it’s predicted that biopharma will add 10,000+ new jobs by 2023. With a Health Sector MBA from Questrom, you’re sure to stand out in a crowded field of competitors. In this increasingly complex sector, leaders must possess more than scientific expertise.\nThe decisions they must make require mastery of sophisticated tools and methods, like the advanced technology of digital health and health analytics. And the teams they lead are interdisciplinary, essential to advancing care and new therapeutics and diagnostics. Questrom’s HSM program—accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Health Care Management Education (CAHME) and a member of the prestigious Business School Alliance for Health Management (BAHM)—delivers well-prepared graduates who meet these new demands.\nCreate a curriculum for the career you want. In addition to your health sector specialization, our MBA career pathways allow you to mix and match electives to reach your individual career goals. Travel your own path! Whatever your specialty or area of interest—health services delivery, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, diagnostics—the HSM program will prepare you for the kinds of challenges faced every day across the industry and give you the insight and expertise you need to make a difference. Many of our students go into biopharma, care delivery, healthcare consulting, and digital health. In addition to all of the great career resources we provide to all full-time MBA students, Health Sector MBA students will engage directly with academic experts and industry leaders in the health sector space through global immersion courses, consulting projects, case competitions, guest speakers, classroom activities, and more. HSM students also benefit from a strong and committed HSM alumni network (2000+) in Boston and beyond willing to help you succeed.\nHSM grads employed within 90 days of graduation\nClass of 2022\nRetention rate\nClass of 2022\nAverage salary of HSM grads + signing bonus\nClass of 2022\nNo matter where you want to work, Questrom’s HSM is a valuable asset. Our students secure employment at all types of industry leaders.\nSuccess in the ever-changing health and life sciences industry calls for a rigorous, responsive curriculum. That’s why we give you plenty of opportunities to customize and focus your degree. Master the core foundations of business, dive deep into Health Sector courses and electives, then put what you learn to the test with a real organization in an internship. And then there are Learning Communities, global immersion courses, and specific Career Pathways. The choice is yours.\nBecause the Health Sector MBA is a specialization within the Full-Time MBA program, they share the same curriculum. By adding the health sector specialization, however, you’ll be able to focus your MBA degree with our HSM targeted electives. HSM students must take 3 Health Sector courses and choose 2 additional Health Sector electives. The required Health Sector courses follow this path:\nCOURSE CODE: hm703\nThis course provides a dynamic introduction to the health sector, beginning with the burden and distribution of disease and current patterns of expenditures.  While the emphasis will be on the American system, a global context will be developed.  The basic elements of insurance and payment, service delivery, and life sciences products will be described, and put in the context of the unique economic structure of the sector.  The intense challenges of the sector will be explored, as well as both the ethical issues presented and the opportunities that emerge.  Public policy and technological and practice development as drivers of change will be addressed throughout.\nCOURSE CODE: hm820\nThis course provides students with tools from the fields of economics, strategy, and finance to understand the problems faced by firms involved in both the provision and payment sides of the health care sector along with those in the life-sciences industry. The course focuses on models that clarify the tradeoffs in the healthcare sector. The goal is to provide students with frameworks for profit maximization, frameworks that are unique to healthcare.\nChoose ONE of the following:\nCOURSE CODE: hm710\nThis course will provide knowledge and skills needed to develop and implement systems capable of delivering accessible, high quality, efficient health care services.  It will draw upon relevant information from disciplinary areas of study including strategy, operations, marketing, finance, law, human resources, quality improvement, and information technology.\nCOURSE CODE: hm717\nThis course will examine issues and opportunities in life sciences including the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, medical devices sectors and the life sciences service industry supporting these sectors.  The course will investigate who manages these companies and what are the strategies that are used to build successful enterprises.  There will be a review of the expertise that is needed in these companies or that must be out-sourced including development, manufacturing, marketing and finance.  The principals governing the industry including patent law, regulatory and FDA compliance will be addressed.\r\n\r\nFormerly, \"Bio-Pharma and Medical Device Companies: Strategies, Solutions and Execution\"\nFull-Time MBA students at Questrom have choices—10 electives within the program to be exact. Health Sector MBA students are required to take 5 Health Sector electives and may use the additional 5 electives as they wish. You can either take additional health sector electives or explore any elective we offer that fits your interests.Here’s a sample of some of the Health Sector MBA electives you’ll be able to choose from.\nCOURSE CODE: hm710\nCOURSE CODE: hm717\nCOURSE CODE: hm801\nThe subject of the course is the translation of medical technologies into new products and services for the healthcare system.  The course begins with a rigorous study of intellectual property, licensing and the core aspects of planning, creating, funding and building new entrepreneurial ventures. Concepts and tools are presented for assessing new technologies and their potential to be the basis for a new entrepreneurial venture.  Comparisons will be made of how technologies can be sourced and commercialized out of three very different environments: universities, national laboratories and corporate laboratories.  Cross-disciplinary teams of students will be formed which will evaluate translational research projects currently being developed at Boston University and their potential for transformation into a start-up company to commercialize the technology, providing a unique linkage between the scientific research activities of the university and the professional schools.  Each week there will be a case study which will discuss examples of both success and failure in technology commercialization.  Some of these case studies examine Boston University life sciences spin-out companies, and the founders and CEO’s of these ventures will share their experiences with the class.\nCOURSE CODE: hm817\nFor students interested in enhancing their skills for positions in the rapidly growing field of healthcare information technology, this course utilizes healthcare delivery, life science, and business leaders to deliver current perspectives and trends in the use of information technology (IT) to enhance patient care outcomes while delivering more cost-effective care. Students explore various methods and approaches that can be applied to both develop and evaluate IT systems encompassing electronic medical records, administrative systems, healthcare mobile applications, and the emerging field of digital therapeutics. The course provides strategic perspectives important to the healthcare chief information officer, chief medical information officer, other managers, prospective healthcare IT entrepreneurs, and users of both clinical and administrative IT systems. Its focus is not on the technical specialist.\nCOURSE CODE: hm833\nThis elective provides an in-depth understanding of health sector marketing in the for-profit and not-for-profit sectors for both products and services (hospital, managed care and health services of all types, life sciences, pharma and biotech, medical devices, medical software, and so on). The course explores how the tools of marketing (e.g., consumer behavior, pricing, promotion, channels, branding, segmentation, etc.) can be employed in the rapidly changing health sector with particular attention to changing organizational structures, financing, technologies, market demands, laws, channels of distribution, on-line applications, and regulations which require new approaches to marketing. Topics to be addressed include marketing to physicians, DTC (Direct-to-Consumer) Marketing, new product development particularly for pharmaceuticals and medical devices, adoption of medical and service innovations, typical decision making units in the health sector, and social marketing. (The course is still in development so there will likely be more topics added.) The course will have you keep in mind always while making marketing decisions that medicine, in the purest sense, is a profession with an intellectual discipline, a tradition of service, and an ethical code of conduct, and that service to the patient, as individuals and in the aggregate, is foremost in marketing decision making.\nCOURSE CODE: hm840\nStudents enrolled in this course will be divided into teams of 3-4 students during the first class.  Each team will be assigned a business development/strategy/marketing consulting project for a local, regional, national, or international health sector organization. These projects have been requested by these organizations; the organizations are covering all expenses associated with the projects and anticipate receiving a consulting report from the student team at the end of the semester.  The deliverables for this assignment are the consulting report as well as a 30 minute in-class presentation followed by a 10 minute question-and-answer period. The team may also be asked by the organization to make a presentation to the organization’s management. These projects constitute a way to apply what you are learning in the MBA program to a real health sector management situation; an opportunity to gain experience and broaden your familiarity with health sector organizations with which you have had little or no direct experience; a way for local, regional, and national health sector organizations to benefit from your expertise and hard work in solving a management problem; and a continuing linkage of the Boston University MBA and Health Care Management Programs to the health sector community.\nCOURSE CODE: hm848\nThis course examines an array of compelling opportunities for innovation, incremental and disruptive, across products and services, created within existing organizations or by starting new businesses. It bridges design and implementation, examining the unique and complex array of elements that make successful innovation in the health sector so difficult, and developing the skills and knowledge needed to effectively address those challenges. The course provides a conceptual framework, and then emphasizes hands-on engagement, concrete exercises, written cases, and in-class speakers who are engaged in real-world innovation initiatives. Students will have the opportunity to focus on areas of particular interest and relevance to current or future work. They will leave better equipped to drive or support the viable, value-creating innovation so desperately needed in the health sector.\nCOURSE CODE: om840\nLean and Six Sigma are powerful improvement methodologies that promote process improvement, cost reduction and significant enhancement of bottom-line profitability. The purpose of this course is to thoroughly examine the concept of quality, to define it in terms that are useful for managers, to survey the ideas of major quality thinkers and theorists, to develop proficiency in the use of quality tools, and to consider the challenges of quality program implementation in real business situations. Throughout the course we will investigate similarities and differences between quality management in manufacturing and service contexts. The course has three major objectives. The first goal is to define quality and explore important philosophies and useful frameworks for managers or consultants. The second goal is to focus on the Lean and Six Sigma tools available for the pursuit of lasting quality improvements. The third is to bring the experiences of Lean Six Sigma practice into the classroom. We’ll benefit from the expertise and experience of Lean and Six Sigma professionals who will help us to understand the challenges of Lean and Six Sigma implementations and analyze the lessons they have learned from projects they have undertaken.\nCOURSE CODE: si814\nFormerly FE814 (students who took FE814 may not take SI814).\r\n\r\nThis course covers the ways in which companies use intellectual property to protect their investments in knowledge assets. Traditionally a concern for technology-intensive businesses, patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets have become important business tools throughout the knowledge-based economy. A good understanding of what IP assets are and how they work has become essential for managers in all types of organizations. This is not a law course, nor a how-to manual rather it is intended to develop your analytical understanding of fundamental economic and legal aspects of intellectual property systems, and how they drive competition and strategy.\n*Courses QSTHM710 and QSTHM717 will count as an HSM elective if not taken as an HSM core course.\nYou can take on the Health Sector MBA at a full-time or part-time pace. Or, tackle two areas at once with our health sector joint degree options. It’s your career vision. We’ll help you make it real.\nFriday, August 8\nSaturday, August 9\nTuesday, August 12\nReady to apply? Once you’ve submitted your materials, we’ll start the review process.

The course begins with a rigorous study of intellectual property, licensing and the core aspects of planning, creating, funding and building new entrepreneurial ventures. Concepts and tools are presented for assessing new technologies and their potential to be the basis for a new entrepreneurial venture.  Comparisons will be made of how technologies can be sourced and commercialized out of three very different environments: universities, national laboratories and corporate laboratories.  Cross-disciplinary teams of students will be formed which will evaluate translational research projects currently being developed at Boston University and their potential for transformation into a start-up company to commercialize the technology, providing a unique linkage between the scientific research activities of the university and the professional schools.  Each week there will be a case study which will discuss examples of both success and failure in technology commercialization.  Some of these case studies examine Boston University life sciences spin-out companies, and the founders and CEO’s of these ventures will share their experiences with the class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvances in Digital Health\n\n\n\nCOURSE CODE: hm817\nFor students interested in enhancing their skills for positions in the rapidly growing field of healthcare information technology, this course utilizes healthcare delivery, life science, and business leaders to deliver current perspectives and trends in the use of information technology (IT) to enhance patient care outcomes while delivering more cost-effective care. Students explore various methods and approaches that can be applied to both develop and evaluate IT systems encompassing electronic medical records, administrative systems, healthcare mobile applications, and the emerging field of digital therapeutics. The course provides strategic perspectives important to the healthcare chief information officer, chief medical information officer, other managers, prospective healthcare IT entrepreneurs, and users of both clinical and administrative IT systems. Its focus is not on the technical specialist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth Sector Marketing\n\n\n\nCOURSE CODE: hm833\nThis elective provides an in-depth understanding of health sector marketing in the for-profit and not-for-profit sectors for both products and services (hospital, managed care and health services of all types, life sciences, pharma and biotech, medical devices, medical software, and so on). The course explores how the tools of marketing (e.g., consumer behavior, pricing, promotion, channels, branding, segmentation, etc.) can be employed in the rapidly changing health sector with particular attention to changing organizational structures, financing, technologies, market demands, laws, channels of distribution, on-line applications, and regulations which require new approaches to marketing. Topics to be addressed include marketing to physicians, DTC (Direct-to-Consumer) Marketing, new product development particularly for pharmaceuticals and medical devices, adoption of medical and service innovations, typical decision making units in the health sector, and social marketing. (The course is still in development so there will likely be more topics added.) The course will have you keep in mind always while making marketing decisions that medicine, in the purest sense, is a profession with an intellectual discipline, a tradition of service, and an ethical code of conduct, and that service to the patient, as individuals and in the aggregate, is foremost in marketing decision making.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth Sector Consulting\n\n\n\nCOURSE CODE: hm840\nStudents enrolled in this course will be divided into teams of 3-4 students during the first class.  Each team will be assigned a business development/strategy/marketing consulting project for a local, regional, national, or international health sector organization. These projects have been requested by these organizations; the organizations are covering all expenses associated with the projects and anticipate receiving a consulting report from the student team at the end of the semester.  The deliverables for this assignment are the consulting report as well as a 30 minute in-class presentation followed by a 10 minute question-and-answer period. The team may also be asked by the organization to make a presentation to the organization’s management. These projects constitute a way to apply what you are learning in the MBA program to a real health sector management situation; an opportunity to gain experience and broaden your familiarity with health sector organizations with which you have had little or no direct experience; a way for local, regional, and national health sector organizations to benefit from your expertise and hard work in solving a management problem; and a continuing linkage of the Boston University MBA and Health Care Management Programs to the health sector community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDriving Health Sector Innovation\n\n\n\nCOURSE CODE: hm848\nThis course examines an array of compelling opportunities for innovation, incremental and disruptive, across products and services, created within existing organizations or by starting new businesses. It bridges design and implementation, examining the unique and complex array of elements that make successful innovation in the health sector so difficult, and developing the skills and knowledge needed to effectively address those challenges. The course provides a conceptual framework, and then emphasizes hands-on engagement, concrete exercises, written cases, and in-class speakers who are engaged in real-world innovation initiatives. Students will have the opportunity to focus on areas of particular interest and relevance to current or future work. They will leave better equipped to drive or support the viable, value-creating innovation so desperately needed in the health sector.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImproving Organizational Performance with Analytics\n\n\n\nCOURSE CODE: om840\nLean and Six Sigma are powerful improvement methodologies that promote process improvement, cost reduction and significant enhancement of bottom-line profitability. The purpose of this course is to thoroughly examine the concept of quality, to define it in terms that are useful for managers, to survey the ideas of major quality thinkers and theorists, to develop proficiency in the use of quality tools, and to consider the challenges of quality program implementation in real business situations. Throughout the course we will investigate similarities and differences between quality management in manufacturing and service contexts. The course has three major objectives. The first goal is to define quality and explore important philosophies and useful frameworks for managers or consultants. The second goal is to focus on the Lean and Six Sigma tools available for the pursuit of lasting quality improvements. The third is to bring the experiences of Lean Six Sigma practice into the classroom. We’ll benefit from the expertise and experience of Lean and Six Sigma professionals who will help us to understand the challenges of Lean and Six Sigma implementations and analyze the lessons they have learned from projects they have undertaken.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntellectual Property Strategies\n\n\n\nCOURSE CODE: si814\nFormerly FE814 (students who took FE814 may not take SI814).\r\n\r\nThis course covers the ways in which companies use intellectual property to protect their investments in knowledge assets. Traditionally a concern for technology-intensive businesses, patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets have become important business tools throughout the knowledge-based economy. A good understanding of what IP assets are and how they work has become essential for managers in all types of organizations. This is not a law course, nor a how-to manual rather it is intended to develop your analytical understanding of fundamental economic and legal aspects of intellectual property systems, and how they drive competition and strategy.\nHealth Service Delivery: Strategies, Solutions and Execution\n\n\n\nCOURSE CODE: hm710\nThis course will provide knowledge and skills needed to develop and implement systems capable of delivering accessible, high quality, efficient health care services.

The purpose of this course is to thoroughly examine the concept of quality, to define it in terms that are useful for managers, to survey the ideas of major quality thinkers and theorists, to develop proficiency in the use of quality tools, and to consider the challenges of quality program implementation in real business situations. Throughout the course we will investigate similarities and differences between quality management in manufacturing and service contexts. The course has three major objectives. The first goal is to define quality and explore important philosophies and useful frameworks for managers or consultants. The second goal is to focus on the Lean and Six Sigma tools available for the pursuit of lasting quality improvements. The third is to bring the experiences of Lean Six Sigma practice into the classroom. We’ll benefit from the expertise and experience of Lean and Six Sigma professionals who will help us to understand the challenges of Lean and Six Sigma implementations and analyze the lessons they have learned from projects they have undertaken.\nImproving Organizational Performance with Analytics\nImproving Organizational Performance with Analytics\nCOURSE CODE: om840\nLean and Six Sigma are powerful improvement methodologies that promote process improvement, cost reduction and significant enhancement of bottom-line profitability.

The purpose of this course is to thoroughly examine the concept of quality, to define it in terms that are useful for managers, to survey the ideas of major quality thinkers and theorists, to develop proficiency in the use of quality tools, and to consider the challenges of quality program implementation in real business situations. Throughout the course we will investigate similarities and differences between quality management in manufacturing and service contexts. The course has three major objectives. The first goal is to define quality and explore important philosophies and useful frameworks for managers or consultants. The second goal is to focus on the Lean and Six Sigma tools available for the pursuit of lasting quality improvements. The third is to bring the experiences of Lean Six Sigma practice into the classroom. We’ll benefit from the expertise and experience of Lean and Six Sigma professionals who will help us to understand the challenges of Lean and Six Sigma implementations and analyze the lessons they have learned from projects they have undertaken.\nImproving Organizational Performance with Analytics\nImproving Organizational Performance with Analytics\nCOURSE CODE: om840\nLean and Six Sigma are powerful improvement methodologies that promote process improvement, cost reduction and significant enhancement of bottom-line profitability.

Traditionally a concern for technology-intensive businesses, patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets have become important business tools throughout the knowledge-based economy. A good understanding of what IP assets are and how they work has become essential for managers in all types of organizations. This is not a law course, nor a how-to manual rather it is intended to develop your analytical understanding of fundamental economic and legal aspects of intellectual property systems, and how they drive competition and strategy.\nIntellectual Property Strategies\nIntellectual Property Strategies\nCOURSE CODE: si814\nFormerly FE814 (students who took FE814 may not take SI814).\r\n\r\nThis course covers the ways in which companies use intellectual property to protect their investments in knowledge assets.

The course begins with a rigorous study of intellectual property, licensing and the core aspects of planning, creating, funding and building new entrepreneurial ventures. Concepts and tools are presented for assessing new technologies and their potential to be the basis for a new entrepreneurial venture.  Comparisons will be made of how technologies can be sourced and commercialized out of three very different environments: universities, national laboratories and corporate laboratories.  Cross-disciplinary teams of students will be formed which will evaluate translational research projects currently being developed at Boston University and their potential for transformation into a start-up company to commercialize the technology, providing a unique linkage between the scientific research activities of the university and the professional schools.  Each week there will be a case study which will discuss examples of both success and failure in technology commercialization.  Some of these case studies examine Boston University life sciences spin-out companies, and the founders and CEO’s of these ventures will share their experiences with the class.\nCOURSE CODE: hm801\nThe subject of the course is the translation of medical technologies into new products and services for the healthcare system.

The course explores how the tools of marketing (e.g., consumer behavior, pricing, promotion, channels, branding, segmentation, etc.) can be employed in the rapidly changing health sector with particular attention to changing organizational structures, financing, technologies, market demands, laws, channels of distribution, on-line applications, and regulations which require new approaches to marketing. Topics to be addressed include marketing to physicians, DTC (Direct-to-Consumer) Marketing, new product development particularly for pharmaceuticals and medical devices, adoption of medical and service innovations, typical decision making units in the health sector, and social marketing. (The course is still in development so there will likely be more topics added.) The course will have you keep in mind always while making marketing decisions that medicine, in the purest sense, is a profession with an intellectual discipline, a tradition of service, and an ethical code of conduct, and that service to the patient, as individuals and in the aggregate, is foremost in marketing decision making.\nCOURSE CODE: hm833\nThis elective provides an in-depth understanding of health sector marketing in the for-profit and not-for-profit sectors for both products and services (hospital, managed care and health services of all types, life sciences, pharma and biotech, medical devices, medical software, and so on).

They’re committed to making waves in the field, and come here to challenge themselves and the future of management. They don’t want to just keep pace with the shifting business landscape, they want to be several steps ahead of it. A Full-Time MBA from Boston University Questrom School of Business launches them there, and shows the marketplace they have what it takes to make an impact.\nAt Questrom, you’ll study in a national hub of innovation. You’ll tackle issues that matter, issues that are redefining the global economy. Speaking of, you can choose to witness it firsthand in countries around the world during one of our global experiences. Our MBAs aren’t just prepared for the real world—they’re immersed in it. Are you ready to cause disruption?\nAdmission to Questrom is growing more and more competitive. Students here are dynamic, eager learners, ready to take on an MBA program that transforms them into the leader they want to be. The Graduate Admissions Committee considers the whole picture when reviewing applicants. We look at professional background, leadership skills, academic credentials, and diversity. We seek candidates who are team-oriented, who are prone to collaboration, and who consider themselves global citizens. Our goal: to create a class rich in ideas, cultures, and life experiences, so you expand your outlook and gain new insights.\nThink we’re a good fit? We encourage applicants from all backgrounds—not just business—to apply to Questrom. We look forward to hearing from you!\nWe know the application process can take a lot of time and effort. If you have any questions, feel free to email or call us at (617) 353-2670.\nApplication Form\nWhen you’re ready to apply, start with our online application form. You may submit one application per entry term, and you can check the status of an existing application at any time. Review our admissions checklist to stay on top of required materials, and keep an eye on our deadlines, too.\nFeel free to contact us with any questions along the way. We want the admissions process to be as simple and transparent as possible. Reach out to the Graduate Admissions and Financial Aid Office at (617) 353-2670 or mba@bu.edu.\nThe Graduate Admissions & Financial Aid Office keeps all records on file for one year. We welcome your re-application. Each re-applicant is required to submit a new application form and fee ($125); an essay discussing updates or changes since the time of the previous application, as well as reasons for re-applying; an updated resume; a new letter of recommendation; official university-level transcripts (if the re-applicant has taken new coursework since the time of their first application); and updated GMAT or GRE results (if applicable).\nThe Questrom admissions committee interviews a significant number of applicants for the Full-Time MBA program. The interview is an evaluative component of the application process and is conducted by a member of the admissions team. Once the application has been submitted to the Graduate Admissions & Financial Aid Office, we offer interviews on an invitation-only basis. Throughout the year, invitational interviews will be offered on campus, virtually, and in select off-campus locations.\nBetween July 12, 2024 and October 9, 2024, prospective Full-Time MBA and Part-Time MBA students can request an evaluative interview with a member of the admissions committee prior to submitting an application for admission for 2025 entry. On-campus and virtual interviews will be available on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and off-campus interviews will be available on a space available basis in select locations.\nTo request an evaluative interview prior to submitting an application, please complete our pre-application interview form  here. For your reference, you will be required to submit your resume. You are also welcome to submit test scores (GMAT or GRE and TOEFL/IELTS/PTE as appropriate) with your request, however these are not required in order to request a pre-application interview. The admissions committee will respond to your request within 3 business days.\nPlease note: Pre-application interviews are only available to those considering the Full-Time MBA and the Part-Time MBA programs. This will serve as your formal interview and will be used to evaluate you in the admissions process should you decide to submit an application for 2025 entry. You will not be granted another interview after submitting an application if you have conducted a pre-application interview.\nIf you have any questions about this form, please email mba@bu.edu, or call us at 617-353-2670.\nThe Graduate Admissions & Financial Aid Office will waive the application fee for current BU employees, as well as for those who attended select admissions events. In addition, we will waive the application fee for those who are members or alumni of the following programs:\nPlease note: To receive this application fee waiver, you must fill out the application fee waiver request form below. Application fee waiver requests must be approved prior to submitting your application. If you submit an application and pay the application fee, we will not be able to process a refund.\nInstructions: To take advantage of this waiver, please fill out this form once your application has been started. Your CAS ID can be found at the top right of the online application. Once we process your fee waiver request, you’ll receive a follow-up email with additional instructions on how to submit your application. DO NOT click “submit and pay for programs” prior to receiving these instructions. We are unable to offer application fee refunds.\nDue to the high volume of applications we receive, your application fee waiver may take a few business days to process. As such, we encourage you to submit your application fee waiver request as soon as you have started your application. If you wait until the application deadline to submit your waiver request, you will still be considered “on time” for that deadline as long as you submit your application within 48 hours of receiving your waiver code. You must submit your waiver request before you submit your application in order for the fee waiver to be applied. Please note: If you have been approved for an application fee waiver and are applying to one of our dual degree programs, the application fee waiver will be applied to your Questrom application only.  You will still need to pay the required application fee for the other school at BU to which you are applying.\nApplicants to the Full-Time MBA program may request a GMAT/GRE waiver provided you meet at least one of the minimum qualifications listed below. The decision to grant the GMAT/GRE waiver is made at the discretion of the admissions committee.\nYou may not request a waiver if you have already taken the exam and requested your scores be sent to Boston University Questrom School of Business.\nPlease note: All candidates who are admitted to the Full-Time MBA program are automatically considered for merit-based scholarships at the time of admission. Because GMAT/GRE scores are one of the factors we take into consideration when making scholarship decisions, those who submit competitive GMAT/GRE scores will receive additional consideration.\nOn rare occasion, after granting a GMAT/GRE waiver, the admissions committee may ask a candidate to submit a GMAT or GRE score to aid in evaluating your candidacy for the Full-Time MBA program. If we need this additional information to complete our consideration of your candidacy, we will inform you after you have submitted the complete application and it has been initially reviewed.\nGMAT/GRE waiver requests are only considered for application to the Fall 2025 entry term for the Full-Time MBA program. For Online MBA and Part-Time MBA testing information, please visit their admissions websites.\nIf you have any questions about this form, please email mba@bu.edu or call us at 617-353-2670.\n*Both December 16 and January 9 dates are Round 2 deadlines, but December 16 is the priority deadline.\nRemember: you may submit one application per entry term, and you can check the status of an existing application at any time.

You may upload unofficial transcripts when you apply.

BU’s GRE code is 3087. GMAT and GRE test scores are valid for 5 years and you should upload an unofficial copy with your online application. You can register for the GMAT exam at mba.com, and the GRE at ets.org. You may also wish to familiarize yourself with these tests by viewing free GMAT sample questions and practice tests, as well as free GRE preparation materials, though we do not endorse any particular prep source and encourage you to do your own research.\nThe Boston University Questrom School of Business Graduate Admissions Committee conducts a rigorous and holistic review of each application. Students admitted to our graduate degree programs must provide proof of an earned bachelor’s degree or equivalent international credential. Boston University does not require official transcripts with the submission of an application. Should a student decide to enroll at Boston University Questrom School of Business, official transcripts must be submitted and verified prior to the point of matriculation.\nIn order to get to know you on a more personal level, applicants to our full-time and part-time MBA programs are required to complete either three short video essays OR one written essay during the application process. Because everyone expresses themselves in different ways, the choice is yours.\nVIDEO ESSAYS\nIf you’re someone who feels they can better express themselves and their reasons for applying to the Questrom School of Business through a video, we encourage you to complete the video essays. Within the “Documents” section of the “Program Materials” portion of the application, you will find your personalized link to the video essay website.\nUpon creating your account with Kira Talent, you can begin your video essays. You’ll need to use an internet-connected computer with a webcam and microphone. We will first ask you a question that all candidates will receive. You’ll have thirty seconds to prepare, and then 60 seconds to record your answer. This will then repeat for two additional random short-answer questions.\nYou can practice an unlimited number of times with Kira Talent’s provided example questions, but once you start the formal video essay questions, you are only allowed one opportunity. This allows the committee to see your candid responses. The formal process should only take you about five minutes to complete, and can be done on your own time. If you have any questions about your video essays once you’ve registered, please contact support@kiratalent.com.\nPreparing for your video essay: We want your recording process to be as easy as possible. As such, we encourage you to dress in business casual attire – no need for a suit. The admission committee will review your responses as part of the application process, and are interested in your presence, personality, and fit with our community. We recommend trying out a few of the sample Kira questions prior to recording your formal video essay responses.\nWRITTEN ESSAY\nIf you’re someone who feels they can better express themselves and their reasons for applying to the Questrom School of Business in writing, we encourage you to complete the written essay. Within the “Documents” section of the “Program Materials” portion of the application, you will scroll down to “Essay” and click “Add Document” to upload your written essay.\nYour written essay should be no more than 750 words and should explain to the admissions committee why you’d like to earn your degree from the Questrom School of Business specifically. It should also address why you have selected the program you are applying to (Full-Time MBA, Professional Evening MBA, Health Sector MBA, Dual Degree, etc.) – and how that program will help you achieve your post-graduate goals.\nOPTIONAL ESSAY\nIf you have additional information to bring to the attention of the Admissions Committee, you may address it in an optional essay of no more than 250 words. Acceptable topics for the optional essay include, but are not limited to, obstacles in your life that you’ve had to overcome, gaps in post-college work experience, choice of recommenders, and concerns about academic/test performance. If you plan to retake any admissions tests (GMAT or GRE; TOEFL, IELTS or PTE), please provide the date of your scheduled test here. To upload an optional essay, please scroll to the “Essay” section and click “Add Document.”\nIf you have questions about the video or written essay process, please send us an email at mba@bu.edu or call us at 617-353-2670. If you need technical assistance with the Kira Talent system, please contact them directly at support@kiratalent.com.\nTo request a GMAT/GRE waiver, you will first need to fill out our GMAT/GRE waiver request form.\nApplicants to the Full-Time MBA program may request a GMAT/GRE waiver provided you meet at least one of the minimum qualifications listed below.

Candidates must present evidence of language of instruction with the application for admission. Appropriate documentation includes a transcript coversheet, an official statement from the university, or a link to the institution’s website that specifies that the mode of instruction is English. Additionally, candidates who have or will have worked for at least two years in a full-time, post-bachelor degree position in the US are eligible for an automatic waiver. If you do not meet this criteria but would like to be considered for a waiver, you can submit a written request highlighting your experience with and proficiency in the English language to mba@bu.edu  prior to the submission of your application. The admissions committee will consider these requests on a case by case basis. If you are submitting test results with your application, please be advised that tests are valid for two years.\nWe are currently accepting Duolingo scores in addition to TOEFL and IELTS.\nTo access the Duolingo test, go to https://englishtest.duolingo.com/applicants. Select Boston University Graduate & Professional Programs as a score recipient, and email questromappdocs@bu.edu with your name and the date you have taken the Duolingo test.\nUndergraduate Degrees\nWe require that applicants hold a four-year bachelor’s degree from an accredited US institution or its international equivalent. If you have earned a three-year degree that is the equivalent of a four-year degree in the US, it will be accepted in the admissions process. For example, if you earned a three-year degree in India, your degree will qualify you to be considered for admission.Diplomas, the Higher National Diploma (H.N.D.), certificates, memberships or associate memberships in some professional organizations, and some bachelor’s and technical degrees are not considered equivalent to a U.S. bachelor’s degree for the purpose of gaining admission to Questrom School of Business.Regardless of program length, if you are uncertain whether your undergraduate degree meets our qualifications, please contact mba@bu.edu before starting the application process.\nPermanent Residents\nPermanent residents should submit a copy (front and back) of their permanent resident card.\nBoston University no longer accepts wire transfer payments for application fees. In order to pay your application fee, please do so with a debit or credit card when submitting your application.\nThe Questrom MBA Deferred Enrollment Program offers undergraduate students who meet the eligibility requirements* the opportunity to apply now to either the Full-Time MBA or Professional Evening MBA at Questrom. If admitted, candidates will then need to gain a few years of valuable, professionally relevant work experience before beginning the MBA.\n*In order to be eligible for this program, candidates must be graduating from a bachelor’s degree program at an AACSB-accredited school or school with U.S. regional accreditation, and must apply during their final year of study but prior to the graduation date of their bachelor’s degree.\nYou’re making a smart investment in BU and in your future. We take that investment seriously. We’re happy to guide you through the financial aid process and provide any assistance along the way. To help you plan for your graduate education, visit Graduate Financial Aid or take a look at the Full-Time MBA-specific information below.\nOur team is here to help you finance your education. From scholarships and loans to benefits and eligibility, we can help you explore your financing options and find the plan that works for you.\nThe following tuition, fees, and other indirect expenses have been established at Boston University Questrom School of Business for the 2025-2026 academic year.  These numbers are expected to be updated to reflect the 2026-2027 academic year in late March of 2026.\nIndirect expenses may not be factored into your student bill, but it’s important to consider them for your personal budget. These can include things like books, course materials, school supplies, and everyday personal costs. When we calculate financial aid and loans, we use a comprehensive cost estimate that includes these indirect expenses to make sure you’re getting a realistic and reasonable allowance for all your potential costs during the year.\nMerit-Based Scholarships\nBoston University Questrom School of Business offers a variety of merit-based scholarship programs for qualified full-time students. Applicants are notified of these opportunities in their initial offers of admission. A separate application for scholarship consideration is not needed, and the Admission Committee considers all admitted candidates for merit-based scholarship awards. For the Fall 2022 entering class, almost 80% received scholarship assistance with the average award exceeding half tuition each year. Here are the various awards Questrom currently offers:\nDean’s Scholarship\nIn our effort to attract the highest quality candidates from around the world, the Dean’s Scholarship program provides awards ranging from $10,000 to full tuition per year for candidates with outstanding professional, academic, and personal qualities.

Both domestic and international candidates will be considered for these awards.\nCity Year Scholarship\nThe Boston University Questrom School of Business has partnered with City Year to sponsor a minimum of three scholarships to our Full-Time Social Impact MBA  for City Year alumni and staff members who have at least one year of service and/or City Year staff members who have been employed for at least two years.

Candidates should refer to the application deadlines and admission decision dates for both schools to determine the best time to submit their application to each program.For the MBA+ JD (non-accelerated), students who are already enrolled in the School of Law may apply to Questrom’s MBA program as a joint degree student.

Because everyone expresses themselves in different ways, the choice is yours.\nVIDEO ESSAYS\nIf you’re someone who feels they can better express themselves and their reasons for applying to the Questrom School of Business through a video, we encourage you to complete the video essays. Within the “Documents” section of the “Program Materials” portion of the application, you will find your personalized link to the video essay website.\nUpon creating your account with Kira Talent, you can begin your video essays. You’ll need to use an internet-connected computer with a webcam and microphone. We will first ask you a question that all candidates will receive. You’ll have thirty seconds to prepare, and then 60 seconds to record your answer. This will then repeat for two additional random short-answer questions.\nYou can practice an unlimited number of times with Kira Talent’s provided example questions, but once you start the formal video essay questions, you are only allowed one opportunity. This allows the committee to see your candid responses. The formal process should only take you about five minutes to complete, and can be done on your own time. If you have any questions about your video essays once you’ve registered, please contact support@kiratalent.com.\nPreparing for your video essay: We want your recording process to be as easy as possible. As such, we encourage you to dress in business casual attire – no need for a suit. The admission committee will review your responses as part of the application process, and are interested in your presence, personality, and fit with our community. We recommend trying out a few of the sample Kira questions prior to recording your formal video essay responses.\nWRITTEN ESSAY\nIf you’re someone who feels they can better express themselves and their reasons for applying to the Questrom School of Business in writing, we encourage you to complete the written essay. Within the “Documents” section of the “Program Materials” portion of the application, you will scroll down to “Essay” and click “Add Document” to upload your written essay.\nYour written essay should be no more than 750 words and should explain to the admissions committee why you’d like to earn your degree from the Questrom School of Business specifically. It should also address why you have selected the program you are applying to (Full-Time MBA, Professional Evening MBA, Health Sector MBA, Dual Degree, etc.) – and how that program will help you achieve your post-graduate goals.\nOPTIONAL ESSAY\nIf you have additional information to bring to the attention of the Admissions Committee, you may address it in an optional essay of no more than 250 words. Acceptable topics for the optional essay include, but are not limited to, obstacles in your life that you’ve had to overcome, gaps in post-college work experience, choice of recommenders, and concerns about academic/test performance. If you plan to retake any admissions tests (GMAT or GRE; TOEFL, IELTS or PTE), please provide the date of your scheduled test here. To upload an optional essay, please scroll to the “Essay” section and click “Add Document.”\nQUESTIONS?\nIf you have questions about the video or written essay process, please send us an email at mba@bu.edu or call us at 617-353-2670.

Because everyone expresses themselves in different ways, the choice is yours.\nVIDEO ESSAYS\nIf you’re someone who feels they can better express themselves and their reasons for applying to the Questrom School of Business through a video, we encourage you to complete the video essays.

You’ll need to use an internet-connected computer with a webcam and microphone. We will first ask you a question that all candidates will receive. You’ll have thirty seconds to prepare, and then 60 seconds to record your answer. This will then repeat for two additional random short-answer questions.\nYou can practice an unlimited number of times with Kira Talent’s provided example questions, but once you start the formal video essay questions, you are only allowed one opportunity. This allows the committee to see your candid responses. The formal process should only take you about five minutes to complete, and can be done on your own time. If you have any questions about your video essays once you’ve registered, please contact support@kiratalent.com.\nPreparing for your video essay: We want your recording process to be as easy as possible. As such, we encourage you to dress in business casual attire – no need for a suit.

Think of it as framework you can customize based on your individual interests and career goals—in the classroom and beyond.\nIn the Full-Time MBA, you’ll take core courses, a wide variety of electives, and put what you learn to the test with a real organization in an internship. You’ll take electives in your first year, with the flexibility to make your course of study as broad or as deep as you’d like. If you choose, you could focus your degree in the Health Sector or Social Impact, or earn two degrees at one time with our MBA+ MS in Digital Technology. And then there are Learning Communities, global immersion courses, and specific Career Pathways. Our aim is to give you plenty of room to explore and customize. The choice is yours.\nDuring the program Launch, you’ll get started right away with Ethics, learning frameworks that will guide your perspective as you continue in the curriculum.\nYour first semester is divided into two 7-week modules.\nIn Module 1, you’ll delve into economics, accounting, and organizational behavior. At the end of the first module, you’ll apply your new knowledge and teaming skills as you evaluate a company as a possible takeover target within a sector.\nCOURSE CODE: MO713\nThis course introduces concepts, models and frameworks to help you become  better  managers of the organizations you work for, the teams you work in,  the people  you work with and your own professional development. Emphasis  will be on  behavioral science concepts and research findings related to the  major challenge  managers face — how to organize individuals in order to  fulfill the objectives  and strategies of the firm. Topics that will be  examined include: the nature and  dynamics of the organization  (organizational structure and culture, performance  systems and metrics,  reward systems, selection and socialization); the elements  of individual  leadership and personal development (power, decision-making,  emotional  intelligence, career development, developmental needs, feedback, and   mentoring and coaching); managing change within organizational contexts (the   dynamics and stages of organizational change and the skills and tactics  employed  by change agents); and the relationships between the firm and the  external  environment in which it operates. The course objective is to  provide analytical  skills and strategies, substantive knowledge, and a  professional sensibility  that will increase your ability to take effective  action.\nCOURSE CODE: ac710\nAn introduction to financial accounting and how organizations provide financial information to external users (stockholders, creditors, and analysts). The focus is on understanding the impact of business activities and accounting choices on financial statements, and analyzing financial statements to infer the business activities undertaken.  Topics covered include income statement and balance sheet format, purposes, and limitations; statement of cash flows; and analysis of the impact of different business models on financial performance.\nCOURSE CODE: pl727\nUnderstanding and analyzing the core strategic decisions facing businesses in competitive markets.  Students will examine how businesses achieve their fundamental goals given the need to produce goods and services efficiently and a market environment reflecting consumer preferences (demand) and the strategies and strengths of competitors.  Students will develop analytic skills necessary for understanding core business models and how different models create value for the business as well as the larger society.\nModule 2 introduces you to marketing, business analytics, and finance, as well as leadership communications. You’ll polish your presentation skills in our own version of the TED Talk, a “QuestromTalk”! The module ends with a team-based business simulation.\nCOURSE CODE: mk723\nThis course provides a practical understanding of how business strategies and tactics are driven by marketing’s dual focus on customers and competition. Students will learn how to leverage marketing tools and emerging technologies in the creation (e.g., customer insight, product and service design, branding), delivery (e.g., communication and distribution), and capture (e.g., pricing, customer life time value) of marketplace value.  Across business contexts including B2C, B2B, products versus services, global versus domestic markets, small/medium/large organizations, for-profit versus social enterprises, the course builds the fundamental skills involved in analyzing market challenges and opportunities and making decisions for the formulation and implementation of successful and sustainable marketing programs.\nCOURSE CODE: qm716\nThe overall goal of this course is to improve student ability to learn from data, specifically to 1) assess the validity of conclusions that have been drawn from statistical analyses; 2) recognize the extent to which variation characterizes products and processes, and understand the implications of variation on organizational decisions when interpreting data; and 3) portray, summarize and analyze data to support operational and strategic decisions associated with the core business models.  Students will increase their understanding of the use of probabilities to reflect uncertainty; how to interpret data in light of uncertainty to assess risk; and how to build and interpret regression models, which can be used to inform core business and organizational decisions.\nCOURSE CODE: fe711\nThis course begins by briefly introducing students to some fundamental concepts in financial theory, including the separation of investment, cash flow, and consumption decisions for firms; the time-value of money, net present value, and the associated impetus towards value-based decision making; as well as arbitrage and the law of one price, and the idea of efficient markets. Students will then dig deeper into the mechanics of discounting, compounding, and calculating free cash flows, giving them tools to make value-based decisions about whether to undertake or cancel a project within a firm; value a share, or acquire a company, using a given discount rate.\nDuring the spring term, you’ll take semester-long courses in operations management, innovation and strategy, as well as options for 7-week or semester-long finance courses—go as deep as you want. In addition, now’s the time to round out the strong business foundation you’ve built with electives that spark your interest—maybe Branding, Negotiations, or Analytics for Managers. There are 100+ electives to choose from. During this semester, you’ll also put your new skills to work in an integrative project with a real company—past clients include IBM, GSK, Wayfair, and the City of Boston.\nCOURSE CODE: fe712\nThe course begins with a brief introduction to some basic financial securities (stocks and bonds) and how to calculate their risks, returns, and correlations. We will then study the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) of asset pricing model, a theory setting out the required returns on financial assets, and its implications for how to invest in financial markets. We will use the CAPM to derive a required return on investment, which we will then use as to calculate a weighted average cost of capital (WACC), which will be the discount rate used to assess the net present value of business investments. The WACC can be used to find the present discounted value of a firm, or of a potential acquisition, as well as to determine the net present value (NPV) of a project under consideration for investment by a firm. The course will finish with a case study valuation of one such project or acquisition, using knowledge on the calculation of free cash flows from FE711 and of the calculation of the discount rate from FE712.\nCOURSE CODE: si750\n\"Competition, Innovation, and Strategy\" is an integrative course designed to capitalize on your understanding of Finance, Operations Management, Marketing, and other functional issues. The course draws on a number of academic disciplines, especially economics, organization theory, and sociology, to build a fundamental understanding of how and why some firms achieve and sustain superior performance. We also study why some firms persistently generate returns that are lower than average. The course is analytically focused and requires that you evaluate both the external environment and the internal capabilities of organizations. Corporate diversification and global management are important topics that are also featured.\nCOURSE CODE: om725\nThis MBA core course is case-oriented and focuses on topics of use to managers in any environment: process analysis, process improvement, supply chain management, and strategic operations decision-making. The course emphasizes the importance of effectiveness and efficiency and evaluates the potential trade-offs between them.\nIn addition to the above, students will take courses in Leadership Communications (1.5 credits), Team Coaching (0.5 credits), and Career Management (O credits).\n2 Semesters\nYour second year is also semester-based. Most students take five three-credit electives each semester. Kick off the year with an intensive course in managing risk and follow it up with more electives. At the same time, you might even broaden your horizons and pack your bag for a global immersion course here.\nAt least 3 credits of elective coursework must qualify as an Action Learning Course. These can be taken in either the first or second year of the program.\nCreate a curriculum for the degree you want. Whether it’s building on your existing talents or exploring a new business area, MBA career pathways allow you to mix and match electives to reach your individual career goals. Travel your own path!\nTo support you in your career exploration and search, we’ve introduced Learning Communities—groups of students, faculty, and alumni with a shared interest in a business functional area or career. In these groups, you’ll get the low-down on career paths in a particular field, find out about relevant course offerings, and make important connections. Activities include mentoring programs, internship and career panels, and guest speakers. Each group is led by an expert faculty advisor, and you may join as many as you’d like—just follow your passion. What’s more, being a part of a Learning Community doesn’t stop when you graduate—as an alum, you’ll have a built-in network that will last long after your time at Questrom.\nOur Learning Communities include Finance, Innovation & Entrepreneurship, Leadership & Organizational Transformation, Marketing, Strategy, and Technology & Operations.\nIn a course with a real client component, students dive into hands-on experience, applying classroom knowledge to real-world scenarios. It’s the ultimate bridge between theory and practice to prepare for success beyond the classroom.\nIn many courses, you’ll use actual data sets and scenarios to solve real problems, giving you the experiences you’ll need to hit the ground running when you graduate. Examples include:\n“The challenges highlighted specifically in the action learning project included limited resource allocation, organizational structure and potential forms of the way a social impact business can be organized, the necessity to stay adaptable to change, and more. Most importantly, it highlighted an utterly important issue – how to achieve and measure the social impact KPI’s, and at the same time stay profitable. This insight has equipped me with a nuanced perspective on the intricacies involved in implementing strategies within the unique context of the social sector. “\nCOURSE CODE: MK854\nThis is a course about branding, and the ways that brands acquire and sustain value in the marketplace. Cases, readings, in-class discussions, and team/individual assignments are designed to provide: An appreciation of the strategic discipline of branding and its role in creating shareholder value; an understanding of brands as co-creations of consumers, marketers, and cultures, and brand management as a collaborative process of meaning management; a sound foundation in consumer-brand behavior to inform brand decisions; and a capacity to think creatively and precisely about the strategies and tactics involved in building, leveraging, defending, and sustaining strong brands. Select topics may include brand equity, brand (re)positioning, brand relationships, brand loyalty, brand community, open source branding, branded entertainment and other cultural branding strategies, internal branding, brand architecture design and portfolio strategy, brand leverage and extensions, brand metrics, crisis management, and brand stewardship. A team-based brand planning project or series of data-driven applications weaves content throughout the course and, when possible, involves a live client problem. Guest speakers from branding services, consulting, and practice provide insights throughout the course. While this course has obvious relevance for those contemplating brand management careers in product or service markets, it is appropriate for a range of future professionals within for-profit and not-for-profit C2C and B2B worlds, and others who share a simple passion for branding.\nCOURSE CODE: SI859\nGain the skills and know-how to manage up and across your organization, passing the normal organizational tests along the way from technical expert to cross-functional integrator to directing the future course of your organization. This is strategy implementation for the middle manager who needs to 1) size-up the situation and 2) determine how to gain the power needed to achieve their objectives. One of the qualitative factors that will be explored in great detail is personal style choice vis à vis different stakeholders and organizational politics and the resultant perceptions of you and your programs. Students will study both successful and less-successful managers through cases and readings, honing their own, personal managerial style.\nCOURSE CODE: SI860\nThis course will give students an understanding of the challenges of undertaking innovation within an existing corporate organization or other large institution such as governments or universities. Established industries are being disrupted by innovative products and services at an increasingly fast pace. Corporate leaders are confronting a dynamic shift from formal stage gate innovation approaches toward more entrepreneurial, iterative, fast-paced innovation processes such as agile development, design thinking, lean startup, rapid prototyping, and the business model canvas. To deliver innovative results, corporations must bridge ideas generated in the labs of tomorrow with current operations. This course aims to accelerate learning on corporate innovation by examining how corporate innovators can stay nimble and enable smart experimentation without risking the competencies that made them great. As the need to innovate becomes a matter of \"life and death,\" how do large organizations successfully innovate? We will examine how techniques and frameworks developed in the startup world are being adapted for the corporate one and how established organizations select from a portfolio of options to foster innovation.\nCOURSE CODE: IS827\nTo thrive in modern economies, managers, entrepreneurs and investors need a thorough understanding of business platforms. Thousands of firms, from Facebook to Salesforce, now operate as open ecosystems that match buyers and sellers, gain value and market share from network effects, and harness their users to innovate. Drawing on cases from social media, entrepreneurship, enterprise software, mobile services, healthcare, and consumer products, students will analyze and learn to negotiate platform startup, convert existing businesses, and make vital decisions on issues of openness, cannibalization, and competition. Students will interact with execs of major firms such as Cisco and SAP and with startups. They will learn\r\nto apply concepts from two sided networks, industrial organization, information asymmetry, pricing, intellectual property, and game theory to real problems. Known worldwide for his work on network business models, Professor Van Alstyne provides students with the tools to leverage key principles into hands-on creation and management of real-world platforms.\nCOURSE CODE: HM840\nStudents enrolled in this course will be divided into teams of 3-4 students during the first class.  Each team will be assigned a business development/strategy/marketing consulting project for a local, regional, national, or international health sector organization. These projects have been requested by these organizations; the organizations are covering all expenses associated with the projects and anticipate receiving a consulting report from the student team at the end of the semester.  The deliverables for this assignment are the consulting report as well as a 30 minute in-class presentation followed by a 10 minute question-and-answer period. The team may also be asked by the organization to make a presentation to the organization’s management. These projects constitute a way to apply what you are learning in the MBA program to a real health sector management situation; an opportunity to gain experience and broaden your familiarity with health sector organizations with which you have had little or no direct experience; a way for local, regional, and national health sector organizations to benefit from your expertise and hard work in solving a management problem; and a continuing linkage of the Boston University MBA and Health Care Management Programs to the health sector community.\nDuring the 2022-2023 academic year, 20 Questrom MBA teams competed in case competitions. Here are a few highlights.\n20+ teams from 6 world regions tackling tough business and ethics questions provide a forum for students and executives worldwide to discuss, debate, and analyze the merits of international business and its intersection with ethics. The winning team from each region received $10,000 to travel to the final in Southeast Asia.\nEach year,  participants form, storm, norm, and perform over just 7 days. This year’s challenge tasked teams with determining strategic direction and increasing global recognition of local restaurant Shaking Crab as it faces high operating and labor costs. This is a slightly different type of case competition because the judges and mentors are not just executives but consultants and hiring managers with the boutique firms sponsoring the competition.\nThe inaugural competition saw 63 teams from business schools across Boston. Teams are challenged to think of eco-friendly improvements to solve the environmental waste created by “fast fashion,” with event sponsors Rewilder and L.L. Bean in mind.\nThe New Venture Competition awards $72,000 in prizes to early-stage BU entrepreneurs and helps them transform their ideas into something real.\nStudents play the role of VCs who have $100MM to invest in one of the presenting startups. Teams pitch an investment strategy to the VC judges.\nWith support from BU’s Build Lab, Questrom students received 1st place in BU’s $50k SHA Hospitality Innovation Competition, winning $25,000 and $10,000 in the BU $72k New Venture Competition.\nOur students care about creating value for business and society—they know the best way to get there is by working together. We’ve developed a unique teaming curriculum that helps you develop your ability to work productively with others. After each team experience, you’ll receive individualized feedback, which you’ll apply in the next project.\nAt Questrom, you’ll have everything you need to go from idea to impact. You’ll have access to resources like the BUild Lab, our student innovation center. And you’ll have opportunities to take courses like Design Thinking and Innovation, Starting New Ventures, and Scaling New Ventures, meaning you’ll build your entrepreneurial toolkit both inside and outside of the classroom.\nHave an interest in research? Partner with a faculty member to work on an original research project. You could even score a fellowship or job at one of our research Institutes, including the Susilo Institute for Ethics in the Global Economy, Institute for Sustainable Energy, the Digital Business Institute, or Innovate@BU.\nIf you’re ready to get a global perspective, maybe a global immersion course is in your future. These full-semester electives let you earn credit while collaborating with an international company or organization on a consulting project. During spring break, you’ll travel to the host country to explore the business modules of other cultures, meet global managers and CEOs, and gain invaluable social and cultural understanding. Destinations and topics change from year to year. Here are a few of our recent trips.\nIn Milan, learning about luxury means living it. Dive into the Luxury Business Global Immersion course led by Professor Hambrick, where we‘re not just studying—we’re creating lasting memories in the city of style.\nHow do organizations develop innovative products and services that act as sustainable solutions to social challenges? Students tackle these issues by doing a consulting project for a client from a host country and then present their recommendation to the client in person. Recent locations include Brazil and South Africa.\nHave you ever dreamed of climbing the Great Wall of China? How about consulting to a Chinese firm in Beijing? This MBA course involves consulting work with a trip to Asia to deliver the team’s recommendation personally to the client at their offices. Much of the past students’ work over the years has both been implemented and widely published in the Chinese business press. It’s an exciting, rigorous, team-based project that students have parlayed into jobs, both domestically and internationally, in strategy consulting.\nFollowing the theme of Global Strategic Effectiveness, students do a deep dive on the cultural underpinnings that affect doing business in so many of these different locations. During the Field Study, you’ll meet with different companies in Asia with plenty of time for sightseeing.\nFriday, August 8\nSaturday, August 9\nTuesday, August 12\nReady to apply?

We will use the CAPM to derive a required return on investment, which we will then use as to calculate a weighted average cost of capital (WACC), which will be the discount rate used to assess the net present value of business investments. The WACC can be used to find the present discounted value of a firm, or of a potential acquisition, as well as to determine the net present value (NPV) of a project under consideration for investment by a firm. The course will finish with a case study valuation of one such project or acquisition, using knowledge on the calculation of free cash flows from FE711 and of the calculation of the discount rate from FE712.\n[GRID_TABLE]\nCompetition, Innovation, and Strategy\nCompetition, Innovation, and Strategy\nCOURSE CODE: si750\n\"Competition, Innovation, and Strategy\" is an integrative course designed to capitalize on your understanding of Finance, Operations Management, Marketing, and other functional issues.

Each team will be assigned a business development/strategy/marketing consulting project for a local, regional, national, or international health sector organization. These projects have been requested by these organizations; the organizations are covering all expenses associated with the projects and anticipate receiving a consulting report from the student team at the end of the semester.  The deliverables for this assignment are the consulting report as well as a 30 minute in-class presentation followed by a 10 minute question-and-answer period. The team may also be asked by the organization to make a presentation to the organization’s management. These projects constitute a way to apply what you are learning in the MBA program to a real health sector management situation; an opportunity to gain experience and broaden your familiarity with health sector organizations with which you have had little or no direct experience; a way for local, regional, and national health sector organizations to benefit from your expertise and hard work in solving a management problem; and a continuing linkage of the Boston University MBA and Health Care Management Programs to the health sector community.\nCOURSE CODE: HM840\nStudents enrolled in this course will be divided into teams of 3-4 students during the first class.

Here are a few highlights.\nSusilo Institute Business+Ethics Case Competiton\n20+ teams from 6 world regions tackling tough business and ethics questions provide a forum for students and executives worldwide to discuss, debate, and analyze the merits of international business and its intersection with ethics. The winning team from each region received $10,000 to travel to the final in Southeast Asia.\n\n\n\n\n\nBattle of the Boutiques\nEach year,  participants form, storm, norm, and perform over just 7 days. This year’s challenge tasked teams with determining strategic direction and increasing global recognition of local restaurant Shaking Crab as it faces high operating and labor costs. This is a slightly different type of case competition because the judges and mentors are not just executives but consultants and hiring managers with the boutique firms sponsoring the competition.\nSusilo Institute Business+Ethics Case Competiton\n20+ teams from 6 world regions tackling tough business and ethics questions provide a forum for students and executives worldwide to discuss, debate, and analyze the merits of international business and its intersection with ethics.

Emphasis  will be on  behavioral science concepts and research findings related to the  major challenge  managers face — how to organize individuals in order to  fulfill the objectives  and strategies of the firm. Topics that will be  examined include: the nature and  dynamics of the organization  (organizational structure and culture, performance  systems and metrics,  reward systems, selection and socialization); the elements  of individual  leadership and personal development (power, decision-making,  emotional  intelligence, career development, developmental needs, feedback, and   mentoring and coaching); managing change within organizational contexts (the   dynamics and stages of organizational change and the skills and tactics  employed  by change agents); and the relationships between the firm and the  external  environment in which it operates. The course objective is to  provide analytical  skills and strategies, substantive knowledge, and a  professional sensibility  that will increase your ability to take effective  action.\n[CARD]\nModule 1\n[CARD]\nModule 2\n[CARD]\nSpring Semester\nCOURSE CODE: fe712\nThe course begins with a brief introduction to some basic financial securities (stocks and bonds) and how to calculate their risks, returns, and correlations. We will then study the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) of asset pricing model, a theory setting out the required returns on financial assets, and its implications for how to invest in financial markets. We will use the CAPM to derive a required return on investment, which we will then use as to calculate a weighted average cost of capital (WACC), which will be the discount rate used to assess the net present value of business investments. The WACC can be used to find the present discounted value of a firm, or of a potential acquisition, as well as to determine the net present value (NPV) of a project under consideration for investment by a firm. The course will finish with a case study valuation of one such project or acquisition, using knowledge on the calculation of free cash flows from FE711 and of the calculation of the discount rate from FE712.\n[CARD]\nCase Competitions are kind of our thing…\nSusilo Institute Business+Ethics Case Competiton\n20+ teams from 6 world regions tackling tough business and ethics questions provide a forum for students and executives worldwide to discuss, debate, and analyze the merits of international business and its intersection with ethics.
