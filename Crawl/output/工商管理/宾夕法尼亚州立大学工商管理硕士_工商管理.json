Consequently, M.B.A. students need to be aware of the business environments of other countries, the influence of these countries in the global political economy, and new competitors emanating from other parts of the world. About two-thirds of the course is focused on understanding macroeconomic concepts, and analyzing the challenges and opportunities posed by some of the most important countries and regions and the companies headquartered there. Approximately one-third of the course examines global themes that affect virtually all companies, regardless of nationality.\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Business Environment (BA 832)\n\n\nDuration: 7 weeks | Professor: Menglong Guan, Ph.D.\nChanges in interest rates, swings in the business cycle, new international trade agreements: all are macroeconomic events, and all can dramatically impact business.

A wealth of macroeconomic information and data is now available on the web for those who know how to access and interpret it.\n\n\n\n\n\nMarketing Management (BA 800)\n\n\nDuration: 7 weeks | Professor: Andrew Petersen, Ph.D.\nAn examination of the role of the marketplace in company management.\n\n\n\n\nSpring Immersion\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Immersion (BA 836)\n\n\nDuration: 7 weeks | Professor: Lou Gattis, Ph.D.\nGlobal Immersion is designed around a visit to another economic region.

Each Immersion is coordinated by a faculty leader who plans the visit so as to appeal to a wide range of student interests. \n\n\n\n\nModule IV\n\n\n\nEthical Leadership (BA 804)\n\n\nDuration: 7 weeks | Professor: Özge Pala, Ph.D.\nThe objective of the ethical leadership course is to raise awareness of the key role played as a manager and leader in creating and maintaining responsible business conduct in work groups and organizations. The course is also intended to enhance the student's ability to deal with the complexities of ethical decision making in today's dynamic business environment by clarifying and applying personal values.\n\n\n\n\n\nStrategic Management (BA 571)\n\n\nDuration: 7 weeks | Professor: Paul Shrivastava, Ph.D.\nAnalysis and application of concepts and techniques aimed at successfully developing and implementing competitive strategy in a complex business environment.
