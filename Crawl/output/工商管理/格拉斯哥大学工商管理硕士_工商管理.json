Organization as a patient administrator at the limb reconstruction centre, as part of the trauma and emergency team and was tragically killed in Gaza in November 2023.  The Scholarship is open to a Palestinian National who is living in or has been forced to leave the State of Palestine due to humanitarian reasons. The chosen applicant may be domiciled in any country but must be a Palestinian National.  The scholarship is open to prospective undergraduate and postgraduate taught applicants to the University of Glasgow applying for entry in September 2025/26.\nUniversity of Glasgow is committed to support as many self-funded students as possible which is why UofG discounts and scholarships cannot be combined with one another or any external sponsorship discounts (with the exception of Alumni Discount).\nIf you are offered more than 1 scholarship, the lower value award will be deleted from your account.\nIf you are unsure of whether you are eligible to apply, please

All data is anonymised.\nPrivacy policy\nThe University has worked in partnership with the British Council in a scheme to provide Higher Education Scholarships for Palestinians (HESPAL), for the past decade.\nThrough the HESPAL scheme, we have been able to offer fee waivers to students from the Palestinian Territories, enhancing educational opportunities for deserving individuals.\nConsidering the current challenges and the significant obstacles faced by individuals impacted by the conflict in leaving the area, the University of Glasgow extends their support in the academic year 2025/2026 to offer up to 3 postgraduate taught scholarships and up to 2 postgraduate research scholarships.\nThis scholarship is offered as a full fee discount.\nFor more information on eligibility and application process, please visit: Higher Education Scholarships for Palestinians (HESPAL) | British Council\nUniversity of Glasgow is committed to support as many self-funded students as possible which is why UofG discounts and scholarships cannot be combined with one another or any external sponsorship discounts (with the exception of Alumni Discount).\nIf you are offered more than 1 scholarship, the lower value award will be deleted from your account.\nIf you are unsure of whether you are eligible to apply, please contact scholarships@glasgow.ac.uk\nNumber of Scholarships Up to 3 PGT and up to 2

University has worked in partnership with the British Council in a scheme to provide Higher Education Scholarships for Palestinians (HESPAL), for the past decade.\nThrough the HESPAL scheme, we have been able to offer fee waivers to students from the Palestinian Territories, enhancing educational opportunities for deserving individuals.\nConsidering the current challenges and the significant obstacles faced by individuals impacted by the conflict in leaving the area, the University of Glasgow extends their support in the academic year 2025/2026 to offer up to 3 postgraduate taught scholarships and up to 2 postgraduate research scholarships.\nThis scholarship is offered as a full fee discount.\nFor more information on eligibility and application process, please visit: Higher Education Scholarships for Palestinians (HESPAL) | British Council\n \nUniversity of Glasgow is committed to support as many self-funded students as possible which is why UofG discounts and scholarships cannot be combined with one another or any external sponsorship discounts (with the exception of Alumni Discount).\nIf you are offered more than 1 scholarship, the lower value award will be deleted from your account.\nIf you are unsure of whether you are eligible to apply, please contact scholarships@glasgow.ac.uk\n \nNumber of Scholarships Up to 3 PGT and up to 2 PhD\n\n\nEligible

scheme, we have been able to offer fee waivers to students from the Palestinian Territories, enhancing educational opportunities for deserving individuals.\nConsidering the current challenges and the significant obstacles faced by individuals impacted by the conflict in leaving the area, the University of Glasgow extends their support in the academic year 2025/2026 to offer up to 3 postgraduate taught scholarships and up to 2 postgraduate research scholarships.\nThis scholarship is offered as a full fee discount.\nFor more information on eligibility and application process, please

educational opportunities for deserving individuals.\nConsidering the current challenges and the significant obstacles faced by individuals impacted by the conflict in leaving the area, the University of Glasgow extends their support in the academic year 2025/2026 to offer up to 3 postgraduate taught scholarships and up to 2 postgraduate research scholarships.\nThis scholarship is offered as a full fee discount.\nFor more information on eligibility and application process, please visit: Higher Education Scholarships for Palestinians (HESPAL) | British Council\n \nUniversity of Glasgow is committed to support as many self-funded students as possible which is why UofG discounts and scholarships cannot be combined with one another or any external sponsorship discounts (with the exception of Alumni Discount).\nIf you are offered more than 1 scholarship, the lower value award will be deleted from your account.\nIf you are unsure of whether you are eligible to apply, please

They’re designed to help prospective students finance their Master’s courses in an Erasmus+ Programme country while leaving as little of a lasting economic footprint as possible.\nThe scheme is designed to provide postgraduate students with the means to pay their tuition and living expenses – thereby allowing individuals to focus on their degree instead of managing their bank balance. The programme aims to be as inclusive as possible, working under the following guidelines:\nPlease visit the Erasmus+ Master Degree Loans website for more information.\nProspective students must:\nUp to €12,000 for a 1 year Master or up to €18,000 for a 2 year Master (equivalent in GBP, subject to exchange rates)\nProspective students should apply through the financial institution, the universities or online, submitting the following documentation:\nEach lending institution will have different terms and conditions – but all institutions will provide interest rates that are significantly lower than commercial rates. Students will therefore need to visit the specific bank or lending institution’s webpage - where they will be able to review specific terms and conditions.  These are listed below:\nFor more
