To discover their Aspirational Purpose and Values and to start to let go of the expert’s mindset and become more curious. This willingness to dwell in the unknown creates the opportunity to lean into the emerging future while staying present, curious, compassionate, and courageous.\"\nAuthentic Leadership Program\n\nOrganisations and communities facing turmoil and uncertainty need leaders who can find the space to lead. This transformational leadership program inspires participants to expand their human potential to its very highest, and to contribute from their highest future self.\nIndividuals have the opportunity to evolve into extraordinary leaders able to lead with Purpose, Clarity, Compassion and Impact.\nThe Authentic Leadership Program consists of the following five opportunities:\n1. Leading Self and Leading Others unit (BUSN 5000)\nStudents thrive in this unit, passing along immensely positive feedback:\n\"Leading Self, Leading Others was the most valuable unit for me. It takes one beyond standard business administration pedagogy by enabling the impetus for personal development. Jenny Hoffman’s unique coaching approach eloquently guides participants to recognise and draw on valuable internal resources, whilst honing critical soft skills that are increasingly in demand in today’s workplace and highly sought after in the leaders of tomorrow.\"\n--Pearl Chua\n“The path to becoming a leader does not happen in a single day nor even in one unit. It needs constant work on oneself. Sometimes it is not fun when one needs to look into the deepest corners of one’s own soul and identify new ways to grow. As many people say, “if you want to teach something to someone, inspire them by your example.” Doing Leading Self and Others: Leadership Challenge unit was not easy at it seemed to be at a first glance but Jenny Hoffman served as a beam of light during the darkness and helped me to better navigate in the ocean of leadership uncertainty and to get the right wind into my leadership sails that will one day become a big ship that carries others”.\n--Elena Rushikhina\n\"First, thank you for teaching that unit in the most amazing way. I feel the unit is essential for any person who wants to grow sustainably in his/her career. Everybody talks about leading others but what I loved most was the leading-self part. The in-class exercises and reflective assignments helped me discover areas of improvement. The unit not only made me better at leading others but also has made me a better person by helping me to identify and fill gaps. This is why I feel my growth now will be a sustainable one. Once again, many thanks for awesome learnings.\"\n--Aashish Sharma\n2. Playback Theatre\nPerth Playback Theatre was founded in 1982 and is a member of the International Playback Theatre Network which fosters training, research and new developments in interactive and improvised theatre. The 12-session Leading Self, Leading Others unit opens with a performance from this inspiring group of actors and musicians who work to develop relationships, remove barriers and develop the cohort experience that is integral to the MBA Intensive Program.\nParticipants are invited to give voice to their leadership stories, and to explore what leadership means to them while bringing to life the personal experiences of the participants and bringing them closer together with heart, humour and honesty.\n3. Leadership Survey and Debrief\n\nA central feature of this program is the provision of individualised feedback through a number of surveys. This includes the  Print® Survey is a validated, proprietary on-line instrument developed by the The Paul Hertz Group. At a foundational level PRINT® provides an opportunity to raise self-awareness not only about what motivates and satisfies an individual, but also their unique set of Best Self (positive and productive) and potential Shadow (negative, unproductive and automatic) behaviours. These behaviours are the direct outcome of a person’s unique motivational DNA, called Unconscious Motivators®. Print® also reveals how different people respond to negative stimuli (Triggers), and how they can be re-patterned. Students participate in a group Debrief session with highly experienced Executive Coaches.\n\n\n4. Leader as Coach Workshop\n\nCoaching and coaching approaches to leadership and management are recognised as a powerful enabler of successful talent development and organisational transformation where self-discovery, personal initiative, empowerment and responsibility are encouraged for individual team members and whole teams.

Increased disruption and uncertainty require that leaders will have to learn how to fail gracefully without pretending they know what they don’t know.\nUWA MBA students have the opportunity to undertake an international study tour.

Additionally, the program has strengthened my ability to develop and commercialize innovation, positioning me to make a greater impact as I advance in my career.”\nEvelyn Ng, MBA 2024\nGroup Manager Materials and Innovation at Callidus Group\nAdelaide Bevilaqua\nBachelor of Science, Conservation Biology and Management with honours, UWA\nAssociate Principal Marine Ecologist , BMT Commercial Australia\n\nPlease tell us about your career to date.  \nI graduated from the University of Western Australia with a BSc (Hons) in Conservation Biology and Management in 2009, at which point I was already working on a casual basis for Oceanica (now BMT Commercial Australia), as a laboratory assistant. Shortly after graduation I was offered a full-time position and have been with the company ever since. As a junior consultant I was trained as a commercial diver and led marine monitoring programs throughout Western Australia. Over the last decade, I have gained experience managing and implementing small to large coastal and offshore marine infrastructure projects in the energy, resources, ports and harbours sectors. Specific technical and project experience includes provision of State and Federal regulatory approvals advice, feasibility and environmental impact assessments, operational compliance monitoring, environmental audits and scope development. \n\nWhy did you choose UWA to do your MBA? \nI completed my undergrad at UWA and so I am probably biased. UWA does offer very flexible options for completing the MBA program but I was also interested in the access to premier guest speakers and social networking opportunities. \n\nWhat would be your advice to someone considering doing a UWA MBA?\nThere are several people in my office interested in completing an MBA. My advice is to enrol, it is by far the hardest part of the degree. You can always defer, but once you enrol you start to receive information and get a feel for the degree structure, and it just isn't as daunting anymore. Also, go to the information nights and ask questions. Everyone has similar apprehensions about starting post-graduate studies, which is refreshing.\nMatthew Clark-Massera\nBachelor of Electrical/Electronic Engineering, UWA\nOperations Manager, Digital Matter Pty Ltd \n \nPlease tell us about your career to date.  \nI joined Digital Matter (a GPS device manufacturer) in 2017 after completing my undergraduate at UWA. I began in the role of Technical Support Engineer, assisting clients with our products. Over my time, this role has grown to also include inventory management, becoming involved in the finance, as well as managing firmware, software and other engineering teams.\n \nWhy did you choose UWA to do your MBA?\nI thoroughly enjoyed my undergraduate experience and UWA and everything it had to offer – especially the university experience outside of the coursework. Coming back to UWA was natural, but also I believe UWA has a well regarded program internationally, so was a strong choice.\n \nWhat has been the most rewarding aspects of the UWA MBA so far? \nThe highly engaging workshops and seminars. These have helped me learn quickly and broadened my horizons. I am already applying new knowledge to my day-to-day life and work, half-way through my first unit!

Shortly after graduation I was offered a full-time position and have been with the company ever since. As a junior consultant I was trained as a commercial diver and led marine monitoring programs throughout Western Australia. Over the last decade, I have gained experience managing and implementing small to large coastal and offshore marine infrastructure projects in the energy, resources, ports and harbours sectors. Specific technical and project experience includes provision of State and Federal regulatory approvals advice, feasibility and environmental impact assessments, operational compliance monitoring, environmental audits and scope development. \n\nWhy did you choose UWA to do your MBA? \nI completed my undergrad at UWA and so I am probably biased. UWA does offer very flexible options for completing the MBA program but I was also interested in the access to premier guest speakers and social networking opportunities. \n\nWhat would be your advice to someone considering doing a UWA MBA?\nThere are several people in my office interested in completing an MBA. My advice is to enrol, it is by far the hardest part of the degree. You can always defer, but once you enrol you start to receive information and get a feel for the degree structure, and it just isn't as daunting anymore. Also, go to the information nights and ask questions. Everyone has similar apprehensions about starting post-graduate studies, which is refreshing. \n\n\nMatthew Clark-Massera\nBachelor of Electrical/Electronic Engineering, UWA\nOperations Manager, Digital Matter Pty Ltd \n \nPlease tell us about your career to date.  \nI joined Digital Matter (a GPS device manufacturer) in 2017 after completing my undergraduate at UWA. I began in the role of Technical Support Engineer, assisting clients with our products. Over my time, this role has grown to also include inventory management, becoming involved in the finance, as well as managing firmware, software and other engineering teams.\n \nWhy did you choose UWA to do your MBA?\nI thoroughly enjoyed my undergraduate experience and UWA and everything it had to offer – especially the university experience outside of the coursework. Coming back to UWA was natural, but also I believe UWA has a well regarded program internationally, so was a strong choice.\n \nWhat has been the most rewarding aspects of the UWA MBA so far? \nThe highly engaging workshops and seminars. These have helped me learn quickly and broadened my horizons. I am already applying new knowledge to my day-to-day life and work, half-way through my first unit! I have a fresh interest in business topics. As an engineer this is not something I thought I would enjoy quite as much as I have been – but the course content and delivery really makes it great fun to learn!\n[CARD]\nMeet our MBA students",
