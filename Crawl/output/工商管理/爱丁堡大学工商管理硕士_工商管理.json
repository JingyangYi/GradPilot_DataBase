As the world continues to change, our MBA prepares you to change with it.\nThe full-time MBA is an intensive programme designed for students with a minimum of three years' managerial experience who wish to progress to more senior and leadership roles in business.\nThe programme immerses students in a world of academic thought, current business practice and applied projects.\nSuccessful businesses in the future will be those that can confidently and capably steer a path through a world characterised by intense competition, rapid technological development, economic turbulence and increasing resource insecurity.\nBusinesses need leaders who can think and act strategically in this volatile environment, managing the risk and challenges involved, but also spotting and seizing opportunities for efficiency, innovation and new business models. Businesses also need leaders who will act responsibly in delivering value to all stakeholders.\nOur programme enhances your career potential by giving you a clear focus on the role of the highly sought strategic leader and helps you to progress with confidence. In order to achieve this our MBA is built on three pillars:\nNot only is the University of Edinburgh Business School part of a world renowned University, but it is also accredited by the three most influential business accreditation bodies: the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB), the EFMD Quality Improvement System (EQUIS) and the Association of MBAs (AMBA). This triple accreditation highlights the quality of teaching and excellence of research at the Business School.\nOur MBA is delivered full-time over 12 months starting in September each year. The programme combines intensive academic study with practical application. This is achieved both in the classroom through case studies, but also via consultancy-style projects with external organisations to broaden participants’ insights into alternative business models and approaches.\nThe MBA programme includes a number of compulsory courses as well as a range of specialist courses for you to choose from. For the Edinburgh MBA we have also fully immersed our Professional Development programme into the curriculum as we recognise the value it delivers to our participants. Your studies will culminate in a major Capstone Project.\nFor those who want an international experience, there is an opportunity to study on our MBA (with international exchange) which will give you the chance to spend 2-3 months on an exchange at one of our international partner Universities.\nOur full-time MBA programme follows a Hybrid Teaching Model that provides a blend of face-to-face teaching and online learning. We have developed this model based on past student feedback. The feedback indicated improved student wellbeing, experience, and a feeling of empowerment. Students were able to take a more proactive and accountable approach to balance their own workload.\nIn practice, for compulsory courses, this means that you will be in the classroom daily for interactive 2-hour tutorial sessions in groups of up to 30 students. Additional content will be delivered through online live sessions, pre-recorded videos, readings, case studies, and so on, enabling you to plan and manage your learning in your own time.\nWhen moving on to option courses, these electives will see you selecting and tailoring your studies according to your career ambitions. These courses will generally be taught in intensive week-long blocks and will see you in the classroom every day for around 8 hours per day.\nAs these option courses consist of smaller groups, a more personalised teaching approach will be implemented throughout each course. If studying the MBA with international exchange, then this model may vary depending on the delivery model of the partner institution.\nEvents such as welcome week activities, team building sessions, and community building sessions will also be factored into the programme's in-person teaching structure, which will allow you as a student to discuss opportunities with staff and network among your peers.\nWe link to the latest information available. Please note that this may be for a previous academic year and should be considered indicative.\nStudents will develop an integrated understanding of the essential aspects of business and leadership skills as well as the development of specialist knowledge through the choice of option courses and MBA Capstone project research.\nThere is an option of a specialisation route consisting of taking two options and the MBA Capstone Project in a specific area of focus. Students will have their specialisations recognised with a Business School Certificate in Finance, Entrepreneurship, Strategy or Sustainability. Specialisations must be agreed in advance with the programme team.\nThe personal development programme ensures that, alongside the in-depth business learning, students will also develop the personal skills and characteristics required by senior managers in the modern business setting.\nFor those following the MBA (with international exchange), the study abroad period will add an international dimension to their studies, valuable to all who work internationally.\nThe employment market is highly competitive, but the Edinburgh MBA is distinctive and will provide participants with a competitive edge. MBA participants will engage in a leadership and professional development programme that includes personal diagnostics, career planning and skills enhancement designed explicitly to support participants in their pursuit of promotion or new careers.\nThese entry requirements are for the 2025/26 and 2026/27 academic years and requirements for future academic years may differ. Entry requirements for the 2027/28 academic year will be published on 1 July 2026.\nBefore applying for the full-time MBA programme, please consider our minimum entry requirements, which include academic qualifications, managerial work experience and English language requirements.\n*Important points to note when applying for this programme\nAt least three years' work experience in a managerial role.\nExperience can be from any industry, including the public sector, charitable organisations or the arts.\nManagerial experience encompasses many efforts you may already be undertaking.

If you are using an IELTS, PTE Academic, TOEFL, Trinity ISE, or Oxford ELLT test, it must be no more than two years old on the first of the month in which the programme begins, regardless of your nationality.

Below you can find a breakdown of the cost of living in Edinburgh and other studying costs to help you calculate your finances.\nFunding for postgraduate study is different to undergraduate study, and many students need to combine funding sources to pay for their studies.\nMost students use a combination of the following funding to pay their tuition fees and living costs:\nExplore sources of funding for postgraduate study\nBusiness School scholarships\nExternal Scholarships\nIf you live in the UK, you may be able to apply for a postgraduate loan from one of the UK’s governments.\nThe type and amount of financial support you are eligible for will depend on:\nProgrammes studied on a part-time intermittent basis are not eligible.\nSearch for scholarships and funding opportunities:\nSelect your programme and preferred start date to begin your application.\nDeadlines for applicants applying to study in 2025/26:\nIf you are also applying for funding or will require a visa then we strongly recommend you apply as early as possible.\nWe may consider late applications if we have places available, but you should contact the relevant Admissions Office for advice first.\nYou must submit one reference with your application.\nFull details on the admissions process and the selection deadlines are available on the Business School website:\nFind out more about the general application process for postgraduate programmes:\n• Schools & departments\n• MyEd\n• Strategic Leadership\n• Professional Development\n• Personalised Approach\n• Details of programme structure and elective courses\n• Full-time MBA career development and career outcomes\n• you have professional qualifications with substantial work experience; or\n• you do not hold a degree or professional qualifications but you have a very strong employment record demonstrating a high degree of responsibility.\n• Official GMAT Exam website\n• Postgraduate entry requirements for students from China\n• Entry requirements by country\n• IELTS Academic: total 7.0 with at least 6.0 in each component.

This is achieved both in the classroom through case studies, but also via consultancy-style projects with external organisations to broaden participants’ insights into alternative business models and approaches.\nThe MBA programme includes a number of compulsory courses as well as a range of specialist courses for you to choose from. For the Edinburgh MBA we have also fully immersed our Professional Development programme into the curriculum as we recognise the value it delivers to our participants. Your studies will culminate in a major Capstone Project.\nFor those who want an international experience, there is an opportunity to study on our MBA (with international exchange) which will give you the chance to spend 2-3 months on an exchange at one of our international partner Universities.\n12-month MBA\n\nDetails of programme structure and elective courses\n\n12-month MBA (with International Exchange)\n\nDetails of programme structure and elective courses\n\nTeaching model\nOur full-time MBA programme follows a Hybrid Teaching Model that provides a blend of face-to-face teaching and online learning. We have developed this model based on past student feedback. The feedback indicated improved student wellbeing, experience, and a feeling of empowerment. Students were able to take a more proactive and accountable approach to balance their own workload.\nIn practice, for compulsory courses, this means that you will be in the classroom daily for interactive 2-hour tutorial sessions in groups of up to 30 students. Additional content will be delivered through online live sessions, pre-recorded videos, readings, case studies, and so on, enabling you to plan and manage your learning in your own time.\nWhen moving on to option courses, these electives will see you selecting and tailoring your studies according to your career ambitions. These courses will generally be taught in intensive week-long blocks and will see you in the classroom every day for around 8 hours per day.\nAs these option courses consist of smaller groups, a more personalised teaching approach will be implemented throughout each course. If studying the MBA with international exchange, then this model may vary depending on the delivery model of the partner institution.\nEvents such as welcome week activities, team building sessions, and community building sessions will also be factored into the programme's in-person teaching structure, which will allow you as a student to discuss opportunities with staff and network among your peers.\nFind out more about compulsory and optional coursesWe link to the latest information available.

As the world continues to change, our MBA prepares you to change with it.\nThe full-time MBA is an intensive programme designed for students with a minimum of three years' managerial experience who wish to progress to more senior and leadership roles in business.\nThe programme immerses students in a world of academic thought, current business practice and applied projects.\nSuccessful businesses in the future will be those that can confidently and capably steer a path through a world characterised by intense competition, rapid technological development, economic turbulence and increasing resource insecurity.\nBusinesses need leaders who can think and act strategically in this volatile environment, managing the risk and challenges involved, but also spotting and seizing opportunities for efficiency, innovation and new business models. Businesses also need leaders who will act responsibly in delivering value to all stakeholders.\nOur programme enhances your career potential by giving you a clear focus on the role of the highly sought strategic leader and helps you to progress with confidence. In order to achieve this our MBA is built on three pillars:\n\nStrategic Leadership \nProfessional Development\nPersonalised Approach \n\nAccreditationNot only is the University of Edinburgh Business School part of a world renowned University, but it is also accredited by the three most influential business accreditation bodies: the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB), the EFMD Quality Improvement System (EQUIS) and the Association of MBAs (AMBA). This triple accreditation highlights the quality of teaching and excellence of research at the Business School.\n\n\n\n\n\nProgramme structure\n\n\n\nOur MBA is delivered full-time over 12 months starting in September each year. The programme combines intensive academic study with practical application. This is achieved both in the classroom through case studies, but also via consultancy-style projects with external organisations to broaden participants’ insights into alternative business models and approaches.\nThe MBA programme includes a number of compulsory courses as well as a range of specialist courses for you to choose from. For the Edinburgh MBA we have also fully immersed our Professional Development programme into the curriculum as we recognise the value it delivers to our participants. Your studies will culminate in a major Capstone Project.\nFor those who want an international experience, there is an opportunity to study on our MBA (with international exchange) which will give you the chance to spend 2-3 months on an exchange at one of our international partner Universities.\n12-month MBA\n\nDetails of programme structure and elective courses\n\n12-month MBA (with International Exchange)\n\nDetails of programme structure and elective courses\n\nTeaching model\nOur full-time MBA programme follows a Hybrid Teaching Model that provides a blend of face-to-face teaching and online learning. We have developed this model based on past student feedback. The feedback indicated improved student wellbeing, experience, and a feeling of empowerment. Students were able to take a more proactive and accountable approach to balance their own workload.\nIn practice, for compulsory courses, this means that you will be in the classroom daily for interactive 2-hour tutorial sessions in groups of up to 30 students. Additional content will be delivered through online live sessions, pre-recorded videos, readings, case studies, and so on, enabling you to plan and manage your learning in your own time.\nWhen moving on to option courses, these electives will see you selecting and tailoring your studies according to your career ambitions. These courses will generally be taught in intensive week-long blocks and will see you in the classroom every day for around 8 hours per day.\nAs these option courses consist of smaller groups, a more personalised teaching approach will be implemented throughout each course. If studying the MBA with international exchange, then this model may vary depending on the delivery model of the partner institution.\nEvents such as welcome week activities, team building sessions, and community building sessions will also be factored into the programme's in-person teaching structure, which will allow you as a student to discuss opportunities with staff and network among your peers.\nFind out more about compulsory and optional coursesWe link to the latest information available. Please note that this may be for a previous academic year and should be considered indicative.AwardTitleDurationStudy mode MBABusiness Administration1 YearFull-timeProgramme structure 2025/26 \n\n\n\n\nLearning outcomes\n\n\n\nStudents will develop an integrated understanding of the essential aspects of business and leadership skills as well as the development of specialist knowledge through the choice of option courses and MBA Capstone project research.\nThere is an option of a specialisation route consisting of taking two options and the MBA Capstone Project in a specific area of focus. Students will have their specialisations recognised with a Business School Certificate in Finance, Entrepreneurship, Strategy or Sustainability. Specialisations must be agreed in advance with the programme team.\nThe personal development programme ensures that, alongside the in-depth business learning, students will also develop the personal skills and characteristics required by senior managers in the modern business setting.\nFor those following the MBA (with international exchange), the study abroad period will add an international dimension to their studies, valuable to all who work internationally.\n\n\n\n\n\nCareer opportunities\n\n\n\nThe employment market is highly competitive, but the Edinburgh MBA is distinctive and will provide participants with a competitive edge. MBA participants will engage in a leadership and professional development programme that includes personal diagnostics, career planning and skills enhancement designed explicitly to support participants in their pursuit of promotion or new careers.\n\nFull-time MBA career development and career outcomes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Edinburgh MBA - discover what you are capable of\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nEntry requirements\n\n\n\nThese entry requirements are for the 2025/26 and 2026/27 academic years and requirements for future academic years may differ.

Some roles are designed around a management function. Others take on managerial responsibilities on a case-by-case basis. Whatever your role, we want to see these managerial responsibilities highlighted in your CV.\nMinimum academic requirement\nUK 2:1 honours degree in any subject, or an equivalent overseas qualification.\nIf you do not meet the minimum academic requirement, you may still be considered if:\n\nyou have professional qualifications with substantial work experience; or\nyou do not hold a degree or professional qualifications but you have a very strong employment record demonstrating a high degree of responsibility.\n\nIf you do not meet the minimum academic requirement, may require you to complete the Graduate Management Admissions Test (GMAT)  which is an internationally-recognised assessment of analytical, numerical and verbal reasoning.\nIf we require you to take a GMAT Exam, we would require a minimum score of 555 in the current 'Focus Edition' format, or a minimum score of 600 in the previous '10th Edition' format.\nThe GMAT is not a compulsory part of the application process, but if you have a score that you wish to report to us then this would be welcome.*\nWe accept scores from GMAT Exams delivered both online and at test centres.

As the world continues to change, our MBA prepares you to change with it.\nThe full-time MBA is an intensive programme designed for students with a minimum of three years' managerial experience who wish to progress to more senior and leadership roles in business.\nThe programme immerses students in a world of academic thought, current business practice and applied projects.\nSuccessful businesses in the future will be those that can confidently and capably steer a path through a world characterised by intense competition, rapid technological development, economic turbulence and increasing resource insecurity.\nBusinesses need leaders who can think and act strategically in this volatile environment, managing the risk and challenges involved, but also spotting and seizing opportunities for efficiency, innovation and new business models. Businesses also need leaders who will act responsibly in delivering value to all stakeholders.\nOur programme enhances your career potential by giving you a clear focus on the role of the highly sought strategic leader and helps you to progress with confidence. In order to achieve this our MBA is built on three pillars:\n\nStrategic Leadership \nProfessional Development\nPersonalised Approach \n\nAccreditationNot only is the University of Edinburgh Business School part of a world renowned University, but it is also accredited by the three most influential business accreditation bodies: the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB), the EFMD Quality Improvement System (EQUIS) and the Association of MBAs (AMBA). This triple accreditation highlights the quality of teaching and excellence of research at the Business School.\n\n\n\n\n\nProgramme structure\n\n\n\nOur MBA is delivered full-time over 12 months starting in September each year. The programme combines intensive academic study with practical application. This is achieved both in the classroom through case studies, but also via consultancy-style projects with external organisations to broaden participants’ insights into alternative business models and approaches.\nThe MBA programme includes a number of compulsory courses as well as a range of specialist courses for you to choose from. For the Edinburgh MBA we have also fully immersed our Professional Development programme into the curriculum as we recognise the value it delivers to our participants. Your studies will culminate in a major Capstone Project.\nFor those who want an international experience, there is an opportunity to study on our MBA (with international exchange) which will give you the chance to spend 2-3 months on an exchange at one of our international partner Universities.\n12-month MBA\n\nDetails of programme structure and elective courses\n\n12-month MBA (with International Exchange)\n\nDetails of programme structure and elective courses\n\nTeaching model\nOur full-time MBA programme follows a Hybrid Teaching Model that provides a blend of face-to-face teaching and online learning. We have developed this model based on past student feedback. The feedback indicated improved student wellbeing, experience, and a feeling of empowerment. Students were able to take a more proactive and accountable approach to balance their own workload.\nIn practice, for compulsory courses, this means that you will be in the classroom daily for interactive 2-hour tutorial sessions in groups of up to 30 students. Additional content will be delivered through online live sessions, pre-recorded videos, readings, case studies, and so on, enabling you to plan and manage your learning in your own time.\nWhen moving on to option courses, these electives will see you selecting and tailoring your studies according to your career ambitions. These courses will generally be taught in intensive week-long blocks and will see you in the classroom every day for around 8 hours per day.\nAs these option courses consist of smaller groups, a more personalised teaching approach will be implemented throughout each course. If studying the MBA with international exchange, then this model may vary depending on the delivery model of the partner institution.\nEvents such as welcome week activities, team building sessions, and community building sessions will also be factored into the programme's in-person teaching structure, which will allow you as a student to discuss opportunities with staff and network among your peers.\nFind out more about compulsory and optional coursesWe link to the latest information available.

Students will have their specialisations recognised with a Business School Certificate in Finance, Entrepreneurship, Strategy or Sustainability.

As the world continues to change, our MBA prepares you to change with it.\nThe full-time MBA is an intensive programme designed for students with a minimum of three years' managerial experience who wish to progress to more senior and leadership roles in business.\nThe programme immerses students in a world of academic thought, current business practice and applied projects.\nSuccessful businesses in the future will be those that can confidently and capably steer a path through a world characterised by intense competition, rapid technological development, economic turbulence and increasing resource insecurity.\nBusinesses need leaders who can think and act strategically in this volatile environment, managing the risk and challenges involved, but also spotting and seizing opportunities for efficiency, innovation and new business models. Businesses also need leaders who will act responsibly in delivering value to all stakeholders.\nOur programme enhances your career potential by giving you a clear focus on the role of the highly sought strategic leader and helps you to progress with confidence. In order to achieve this our MBA is built on three pillars:\n\nStrategic Leadership \nProfessional Development\nPersonalised Approach \n\nAccreditationNot only is the University of Edinburgh Business School part of a world renowned University, but it is also accredited by the three most influential business accreditation bodies: the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB), the EFMD Quality Improvement System (EQUIS) and the Association of MBAs (AMBA). This triple accreditation highlights the quality of teaching and excellence of research at the Business School.\nOur MBA is delivered full-time over 12 months starting in September each year. The programme combines intensive academic study with practical application. This is achieved both in the classroom through case studies, but also via consultancy-style projects with external organisations to broaden participants’ insights into alternative business models and approaches.\nThe MBA programme includes a number of compulsory courses as well as a range of specialist courses for you to choose from. For the Edinburgh MBA we have also fully immersed our Professional Development programme into the curriculum as we recognise the value it delivers to our participants. Your studies will culminate in a major Capstone Project.\nFor those who want an international experience, there is an opportunity to study on our MBA (with international exchange) which will give you the chance to spend 2-3 months on an exchange at one of our international partner Universities.\n12-month MBA\n\nDetails of programme structure and elective courses\n\n12-month MBA (with International Exchange)\n\nDetails of programme structure and elective courses\n\nTeaching model\nOur full-time MBA programme follows a Hybrid Teaching Model that provides a blend of face-to-face teaching and online learning. We have developed this model based on past student feedback. The feedback indicated improved student wellbeing, experience, and a feeling of empowerment. Students were able to take a more proactive and accountable approach to balance their own workload.\nIn practice, for compulsory courses, this means that you will be in the classroom daily for interactive 2-hour tutorial sessions in groups of up to 30 students. Additional content will be delivered through online live sessions, pre-recorded videos, readings, case studies, and so on, enabling you to plan and manage your learning in your own time.\nWhen moving on to option courses, these electives will see you selecting and tailoring your studies according to your career ambitions. These courses will generally be taught in intensive week-long blocks and will see you in the classroom every day for around 8 hours per day.\nAs these option courses consist of smaller groups, a more personalised teaching approach will be implemented throughout each course. If studying the MBA with international exchange, then this model may vary depending on the delivery model of the partner institution.\nEvents such as welcome week activities, team building sessions, and community building sessions will also be factored into the programme's in-person teaching structure, which will allow you as a student to discuss opportunities with staff and network among your peers.\nFind out more about compulsory and optional coursesWe link to the latest information available. Please note that this may be for a previous academic year and should be considered indicative.AwardTitleDurationStudy mode MBABusiness Administration1 YearFull-timeProgramme structure 2025/26\nStudents will develop an integrated understanding of the essential aspects of business and leadership skills as well as the development of specialist knowledge through the choice of option courses and MBA Capstone project research.\nThere is an option of a specialisation route consisting of taking two options and the MBA Capstone Project in a specific area of focus. Students will have their specialisations recognised with a Business School Certificate in Finance, Entrepreneurship, Strategy or Sustainability. Specialisations must be agreed in advance with the programme team.\nThe personal development programme ensures that, alongside the in-depth business learning, students will also develop the personal skills and characteristics required by senior managers in the modern business setting.\nFor those following the MBA (with international exchange), the study abroad period will add an international dimension to their studies, valuable to all who work internationally.\nThe employment market is highly competitive, but the Edinburgh MBA is distinctive and will provide participants with a competitive edge. MBA participants will engage in a leadership and professional development programme that includes personal diagnostics, career planning and skills enhancement designed explicitly to support participants in their pursuit of promotion or new careers.\n\nFull-time MBA career development and career outcomes\nThese entry requirements are for the 2025/26 and 2026/27 academic years and requirements for future academic years may differ. Entry requirements for the 2027/28 academic year will be published on 1 July 2026.\nBefore applying for the full-time MBA programme, please consider our minimum entry requirements, which include academic qualifications, managerial work experience and English language requirements.\n*Important points to note when applying for this programme\nProfessional experience requirement\nAt least three years' work experience in a managerial role.\nExperience can be from any industry, including the public sector, charitable organisations or the arts.\nManagerial experience encompasses many efforts you may already be undertaking. It is not defined by having \"\"manager\"\" in your job title or by having direct reports (although you may, of course, have both). Management is any project, initiative, remit, or task (either permanent or ad hoc) where you are responsible for guiding the resources, teams, or individuals to a final goal. Some roles are designed around a management function. Others take on managerial responsibilities on a case-by-case basis.

For the Edinburgh MBA we have also fully immersed our Professional Development programme into the curriculum as we recognise the value it delivers to our participants.

We have developed this model based on past student feedback. The feedback indicated improved student wellbeing, experience, and a feeling of empowerment. Students were able to take a more proactive and accountable approach to balance their own workload.\nIn practice, for compulsory courses, this means that you will be in the classroom daily for interactive 2-hour tutorial sessions in groups of up to 30 students. Additional content will be delivered through online live sessions, pre-recorded videos, readings, case studies, and so on, enabling you to plan and manage your learning in your own time.\nWhen moving on to option courses, these electives will see you selecting and tailoring your studies according to your career ambitions. These courses will generally be taught in intensive week-long blocks and will see you in the classroom every day for around 8 hours per day.\nAs these option courses consist of smaller groups, a more personalised teaching approach will be implemented throughout each course. If studying the MBA with international exchange, then this model may vary depending on the delivery model of the partner institution.\nEvents such as welcome week activities, team building sessions, and community building sessions will also be factored into the programme's in-person teaching structure, which will allow you as a student to discuss opportunities with staff and network among your peers.\nFind out more about compulsory and optional coursesWe link to the latest information available.

Management is any project, initiative, remit, or task (either permanent or ad hoc) where you are responsible for guiding the resources, teams, or individuals to a final goal.

Entry requirements for the 2027/28 academic year will be published on 1 July 2026.\nBefore applying for the full-time MBA programme, please consider our minimum entry requirements, which include academic qualifications, managerial work experience and English language requirements.\n*Important points to note when applying for this programme\nProfessional experience requirement\nAt least three years' work experience in a managerial role.\nExperience can be from any industry, including the public sector, charitable organisations or the arts.\nManagerial experience encompasses many efforts you may already be undertaking. It is not defined by having \"\"manager\"\" in your job title or by having direct reports (although you may, of course, have both). Management is any project, initiative, remit, or task (either permanent or ad hoc) where you are responsible for guiding the resources, teams, or individuals to a final goal. Some roles are designed around a management function. Others take on managerial responsibilities on a case-by-case basis. Whatever your role, we want to see these managerial responsibilities highlighted in your CV.\nMinimum academic requirement\nUK 2:1 honours degree in any subject, or an equivalent overseas qualification.\nIf you do not meet the minimum academic requirement, you may still be considered if:\n\nyou have professional qualifications with substantial work experience; or\nyou do not hold a degree or professional qualifications but you have a very strong employment record demonstrating a high degree of responsibility.\n\nIf you do not meet the minimum academic requirement, may require you to complete the Graduate Management Admissions Test (GMAT)  which is an internationally-recognised assessment of analytical, numerical and verbal reasoning.\nIf we require you to take a GMAT Exam, we would require a minimum score of 555 in the current 'Focus Edition' format, or a minimum score of 600 in the previous '10th Edition' format.\nThe GMAT is not a compulsory part of the application process, but if you have a score that you wish to report to us then this would be welcome.*\nWe accept scores from GMAT Exams delivered both online and at test centres.

If you apply by the application deadline for a specific round, you can usually expect to receive a result by the decision deadline for that round.\nIf you do not receive an offer in a particular round, you will either be notified that your application has been unsuccessful, or we will carry your application forward to be considered in the next round.\nWe advise that you apply as soon as possible so that you can meet the conditions of any offer, for example visa or English language requirements.\nYou will be able to submit an application until the programme closes for admissions. If the programme is not full by the final application deadline, we may be able to consider applications submitted after that date. If we are still accepting applications following the final deadline, we will clearly indicate that on the programme's application page. If you require a visa we recommend that you submit your application by 11 June.\nWe are still accepting MBA applications for September 2025 entry but please note applications for the International Exchange have now closed.\nPlease be aware that for those hoping to secure University accommodation, you need to have both:\nPostgraduate accommodation guarantee\nSelection and admissions strategy\n• Received and accepted an unconditional firm offer of study for the University by 31 July\n• Applied for your University accommodation by 31 July\n[HTML_TABLE]\nRound | Application Deadline | Decisions By\n1 | 16 October 2024 | 28 November 2024\n2 | 27 November 2024 | 23 January 2025\n3 | 29 January 2025 | 13 March 2025\n4 | 5 March 2025 | 24 April 2025\n5 | 23 April 2025 | 12 June 2025\n6 | 11 June 2025 | 31 July 2025\n[GRID_TABLE]\nThis site uses cookies\n        \nWe use necessary cookies to make our sites work.

All in a compact, 12-month package that gets you back into the workforce quickly and better prepared for the path ahead.\nOur full-time MBA programme follows a Hybrid Teaching Model that provides a blend of face-to-face teaching and online learning. We have developed this model based on past student feedback. The feedback indicated improved student wellbeing, experience, and a feeling of empowerment. Students were able to take a more proactive and accountable approach to balance their own workload.\nIn practice, for compulsory courses, this means that you will be in the classroom daily for interactive 2-hour tutorial sessions in groups of up to 30 students. Additional content will be delivered through online live sessions, pre-recorded videos, readings, case studies, and so on, enabling you to plan and manage your learning in your own time.\nWhen moving on to option courses, these electives will see you selecting and tailoring your studies according to your career ambitions. These courses will generally be taught in intensive week-long blocks and will see you in the classroom every day for around 8 hours per day.\nAs these option courses consist of smaller groups, a more personalised teaching approach will be implemented throughout each course. If studying the MBA with international exchange, then this model may vary depending on the delivery model of the partner institution.\nEvents such as welcome week activities, team building sessions, and community building sessions will also be factored into the programme's in-person teaching structure, which will allow you as a student to discuss opportunities with staff and network among your peers.\nBetween September and March, all students study 11 compulsory courses in major disciplines including strategic leadership, professional development, finance, business transformation, strategic marketing and operations improvement. From April onwards students study from a selection of electives and work on their final management project.\nDepending on which MBA pathway you choose, you will either undertake electives in Edinburgh, chosen from our diverse catalogue of courses, or embark on courses offered by one of our exchange partners in an international setting.\nIn both cases, you can tailor your studies towards specific career interests, develop international management skills, and improve your cultural versatility.\nTowards the end of the MBA programme you will write a 7,500 word problem-solving assignment. This is a real-life assignment and you can tailor it to your interests and career intentions. For example, it can be based on an organisation which you may have previously worked or might wish to in the future. There is the opportunity to follow a research, consultancy or business plan pathway.\nFind out what topics past students have researched by browsing a selection of dissertation summaries by our postgraduates:\nDissertation executive summaries\nA typical year of study might look as follows* — the below information details the structure and courses for this programme in 2025/26.\nIn addition to the main programme, a series of practitioner speakers and Masterclasses will be organised on specialised topics in response to contemporary business developments and student interests.\n*We will notify you of any changes to your courses at least two months before your programme starts. Occasionally we may need to make changes after this date where there are unforeseen circumstances.\nWe will give students their preferred option course wherever possible. Where there is high demand we can’t always guarantee this. In addition, we cannot guarantee all options courses will run each year as these are dependent on student interest, scheduling and staff availability.\nFinally, we continue to review our course content to ensure it remains relevant and may modify, replace or remove courses.\nFull programme details, including all available compulsory and elective courses can be found on the University degree programme tables website.\nMBA degree programme table\nDetails of the international exchange\n*We continue to review our course content to ensure it remains relevant and may modify, replace or remove courses.\n**The number of exchange opportunities at each university will vary each year, and places at USA universities are particularly limited.
