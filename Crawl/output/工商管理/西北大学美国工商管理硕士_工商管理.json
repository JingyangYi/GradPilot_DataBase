You’ll find information and key resources below to help you prepare, navigate and successfully complete your application.\nA bachelor’s or equivalent degree from an accredited college or university by the time of matriculation is required to apply. Previous study in business or economics is not required, with the exception of the One-Year Program. Since much of the MBA curriculum utilizes quantitative skills, we encourage students to complete introductory courses in calculus and statistics prior to enrolling.\nWhen we evaluate our applicants, a few qualities really stand out to us, including the ability to push past comfort zones and question the norm. These responses and instincts help us understand if an applicant is ready to seize all of the opportunities that come with joining Kellogg.\nThe committee assesses your:\nFor international candidates, the committee also assesses:\nThe committee also values professional experience, including military service. We look for breadth and depth of skills and experiences to serve as a foundation for the MBA classroom. We look for people who are not afraid to question the status quo, can motivate a team to drive impact, and are eager to dive in and collaborate with an engaged, ambitious community of peers.\nChoosing the right program for you\nThere is no \"one-size-fits-all\" when it comes to business, so why should your MBA be any different? At Kellogg, we are proud to offer six distinct Full-Time MBA Programs — One-Year, Two-Year, MBAi, MMM, JD-MBA and MD-MBA — all uniquely designed to fit your personal and professional goals. If you haven’t already, we highly encourage you to research all program options to make sure you’ve found the right fit for your needs.\nEach applicant is allowed to apply to one full-time Kellogg program per year. Once you submit your application, you have the option to select one alternate Full-Time Program of interest and/or the Kellogg Evening & Weekend MBA Program. If you select an alternate program, you'll be asked to provide a short paragraph explaining your interest in the other program.\nTo apply to Kellogg, you’ll need an updated version of your resume or CV, transcripts from all educational institutions, test scores and two recommendation letters. If you know you plan to apply but do not want to begin your application yet, we recommend beginning to gather these materials.\nThe most important thing you can do during this process is to be your authentic self. We can’t stress enough that there are no “right” or “wrong” answers. Rather, we encourage you to tell your story as authentically and honestly as possible, because we truly want to get to know you and the experiences that helped shaped you as a person, student and employee.\nThese components of the application are a core part of showing us your experience and aptitude so we can get a better idea of your ability to tackle the challenging MBA curriculum.\nYou’ll be asked to provide a current resume or CV as part of the application. It should be similar to one you would use for a job application, but tailored to a more general audience as it will be reviewed by those with different backgrounds. You are not obligated to submit it in a specific format or length. Instead, try to ensure our team can look at your resume and application and easily understand your professional background and accomplishments.\nIn addition to submitting a copy of your resume/CV, the application has an employment section. This is to provide us with a more in-depth understanding of your career history, key transitions between jobs, and promotions. Make sure to double-check the accuracy of the information in this section.\nWith the exception of our Kellogg Future Leaders Deferred Enrollment Program, we strongly recommend that you have at least two years of full-time work experience upon matriculation. We firmly believe work experience will enrich your academic experience and allow you to fully participate in classroom discussions and group projects.\nYour education is a major part of how you got here today, and we want to make sure we understand all parts of it. We ask that you list all colleges, universities and study abroad programs you have attended or are currently attending. Please note:\nAll records must show your name, the name of the institution, enrollment dates, courses taken, units of credit, marks or ratings in each subject, and rank in the total class or group (if available).\nKellogg requires you to submit a GMAT, GMAT Focus, or GRE score; no preference is given to one particular test so choose the option that works best for you. If you’re interested in seeing a typical score range, check out our latest Class Profile. Note that we do not have a minimum acceptable score.\nPlease request that official test scores are sent to Kellogg by using one of the following school codes:\nIf English is not your first language, we encourage you to read more about the additional English language proficiency test.\nWe want to get to know you. The written and video essays are your chance to tell us your story and why Kellogg is the right next chapter for you. Take some time to think through the experiences that led you here and how they have shaped where you want to go.\nThe following two essays are required of all applicants:\nIntentionality is a key aspect of what makes our graduates successful Kellogg leaders. Help us understand your journey by articulating your motivations for pursuing an MBA, the specific goals you aim to achieve, and why you believe now is the right moment. Moreover, share why you feel Kellogg is best suited to serve as a catalyst for your career aspirations and what you will contribute to our community of lifelong learners during your time here.\nKellogg leaders are primed to tackle challenges everywhere, from the boardroom to their neighborhoods. Describe a specific professional experience where you had to make a difficult decision. Reflecting on this experience, identify the values that guided your decision-making process and how it impacted your leadership style.\nThose applying to or listing a specialty program as their alternative choice will be prompted to complete an additional question.\n\nRe-applicants will receive a prompt about their growth since their last application: How have you grown or changed personally and professionally since you previously applied and what steps have you taken to become the strongest candidate you can be? (250 words)\nWe’ve read your essays, we’ve read your resume — now we want you to bring all that to life in a video. Show us the person behind all those carefully crafted words.\nThe video will be comprised of three questions, each designed to help you showcase your personality and share some of the experiences that brought you here today.\nSome things to keep in mind as you prepare to complete this section:\nHere are some additional tips:\nLetters of recommendation provide insight into your experience and accomplishments as a leader through the eyes of someone else.\nYou’ll need to submit two letters of recommendation for your application to be considered complete. Ideally, one letter should come from a current supervisor or manager. The second should come from someone who can evaluate your professional performance and your managerial/leadership potential (e.g., former supervisor, previous employer, client).\nPlease choose your recommenders carefully as additional letters of support are neither required nor encouraged.\nThe application fee is $250. You will need to submit your payment via credit card within the application. Do not send payments directly to Kellogg.\nFee waivers are granted to:\nProvide supporting evidence of your current employment or military status. Military applicants should submit either a pay stub or a letter from a commanding officer to verify active duty status. For military veterans, please submit a copy of Form DD-214.\nCandidates may not be considered for more than one program at a time. Please note that all application fees are non-refundable.\nThe interview provides an opportunity for you to learn more about our community. It also allows the admissions committee to further evaluate your interpersonal and communication skills, career focus and motivations for pursuing a Kellogg MBA.\nAll interviews are virtual. You will receive an email regarding the status of your interview and scheduling instructions. Interview invitations are sent on a rolling basis throughout the evaluation period up until decision release. The timing of your interview is not an indication of your status as a candidate.\nYou may not change the time of your interview after it is scheduled. If you are unable to attend your interview, please contact the Office of Admissions at 847.491.3308 to cancel your request. We will reach out directly if further information is needed to render a decision.\nYou may submit employment changes, grades for recent classes, or new test scores to your application after submitting it. We encourage you to add this update directly to your application. To do this, please sign in to your application and then add your update in the supplemental information page. Please note that, due to admissions cycle timing, there is no guarantee that we will be able to consider updated information prior to rendering a decision.\nYou’ve invested time, energy and resources into completing your Kellogg application, so no doubt you’ll want confirmation that your application was received. And we want you to have that peace of mind, too! So, once you submit your application, you can log back in at any time to view the status and double-check that all sections were successfully completed.\nYou can check your application portal for your decision.\nKellogg does not make decisions related to admissions, including but not limited to financial aid and scholarships, based upon any category protected by the law.
