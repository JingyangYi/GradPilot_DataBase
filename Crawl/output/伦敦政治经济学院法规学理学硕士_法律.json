Governments have increasingly used regulation in preference to other policy instruments. Transnational regulation – often involving a diversity of non-state actors – has become a defining feature of the international economy. Regulation therefore plays a central role in the contemporary understanding of law and public policy. As a field of study, regulation requires a multidisciplinary approach. Legal, political and economic issues are intertwined and each has to be understood to make sense of the overall process.\nThe programme takes a distinctive multidisciplinary approach, which concentrates on institutional issues and behaviour in regulation – regulatory bureaucracies, interest groups, legislators and courts – in addition to the economic aspects of regulation. We aim to bring together the contrasting North American and European perspectives on regulation, and to juxtapose experience of regulatory practice with theoretical ideas about how regulation works.\nUpper second class honours degree (2:1) or equivalent in any discipline, and interest in or experience of related areas of law, public administration, politics or economics.\nPlease select your country from the dropdown list below to find out the entry requirements that apply to you.\nEnglish language requirements\nThe English language requirement for this programme is Higher. Read more about our English language requirements.\nCompetition for places at LSE is strong. So, even if you meet the minimum entry requirements, this does not guarantee you an offer of a place.\nHowever, please don’t feel deterred from applying – we want to hear from all suitably qualified students. Think carefully about how you can put together the strongest possible application to help you stand out from other students.\nYou'll take a compulsory course on Law and Politics of Regulation and then have the opportunity to specialise through your choice of options and your dissertation topic. If you take two full courses (or equivalent) or a full course and a dissertation in one of the following specialisms: Environmental Regulation, Financial and Commercial Regulation, Social Regulation, Utilities Regulation and Government and Law, you may have this specialism included in your degree title, for example, MSc Regulation (Environmental Regulation).\nFor the latest list of courses, please go to the relevant School Calendar page.\nA few important points you’ll need to know:\nWe may need to change, suspend or withdraw a course or programme of study, or change the fees due to unforeseen circumstances. We’ll always notify you as early as possible and recommend alternatives where we can.\nThe School is not liable for changes to published information or for changing, suspending or withdrawing a course or programme of study due to events outside our control (including a lack of demand, industrial action, fire, flooding or other damage to premises).\nPlaces are limited on some courses and/or subject to specific entry requirements so we cannot therefore guarantee you a place.\nChanges to programmes and courses may be made after you’ve accepted your offer of a place – normally due to global developments in the discipline or student feedback. We may also make changes to course content, teaching formats or assessment methods but these are always made to improve the learning experience.\nFor\nfull details about the availability or content of courses and programmes,\nplease take a look at the School’s Calendar, or contact\nthe relevant academic department.\nSome\nmajor changes to programmes/courses are posted on our updated graduate course and programme information page.\nDiscover more about our students and department.\nThe Department of Government is an internationally renowned centre for teaching and research on politics and government.\nWithin our department, we have 850 undergraduates, postgraduates and research students and more than 40 faculty staff – who come from 80 countries.\nOur research focuses on six main areas:\nThe department’s work covers national, sub-national and global politics – with a strong emphasis on public-facing research.\nTeaching within the department draws on these strengths and our central role in a prestigious social science institution. As a student, you’ll learn from internationally renowned academics and study in the heart of London, close to the UK’s political heartland in Westminster and the Houses of Parliament.\nOur students gain the knowledge and skills to become sharp-minded critical thinkers who apply diverse analytical perspectives to political issues and conflicts around the globe. We encourage students to reflect on what it means to be responsible for addressing urgent public problems and engage in these issues in practical ways to prepare for their future careers. Our graduates find fulfilling roles in government, financial and professional services, teaching and research.\nLearn more about our programmes, research, public events and people.\nWe welcome applications from all suitably qualified prospective students. At LSE, we want to recruit students with the best academic merit, potential and motivation, irrespective of background.\nWe carefully consider each application and take into account all the information included on your application form, such as your:\nSee further information on supporting documents.\nYou may need to provide evidence of your English language proficiency. See our English language requirements.\nApplications for this programme are considered on a rolling basis. This means that applications will close once the programme is full.\nThere is no fixed deadline. However, if you’d like to be considered for any funding opportunities, you must submit your application (and all supporting documents) by the funding deadline. See the fees and funding section below for more details.\nThe\ntable of fees shows the latest tuition fees for all programmes.\nYou're charged a fee for your programme. At LSE, your tuition fee covers registration and examination fees payable to the School, lectures, classes and individual supervision, lectures given at other colleges under intercollegiate arrangements and, under current arrangements, membership of the Students' Union. It doesn't cover living costs or travel or fieldwork.\nHome student fee (2025/26)\nFor this programme, all students pay the same tuition fees, regardless of their fee status.\nOverseas student fee (2025/26)\nAt LSE, your tuition fees, and eligibility for any financial support, will depend on whether you’re classified as a home or overseas student (known as your fee status). We assess your fee status based on guidelines provided by the Department for Education.\nFurther information about fee status classification.\nFee reduction\nStudents who completed undergraduate study at LSE and are beginning taught graduate study at the School are eligible for a fee reduction of around 10 per cent of the fee.\nScholarships and other funding\nWe recognise\nthat the cost of living in London may\nbe higher than in your home town/city or country and we provide generous\nscholarships to help both home and overseas students.\nWe offer some\nneeds-based awards for this programme, including the Graduate Support Scheme, Master's Awards, and Anniversary Scholarships. Competition\nfor these awards and scholarships is strong. To apply for an award, you must\nhave an offer of a place and submit a Graduate Financial\nSupport application before the funding deadline.\nThe funding deadline for needs-based awards from LSE: 6 May 2025.\nIn addition to\nour needs-based awards, we offer scholarships for students from specific regions of the world\nand awards for certain subjects.\nYou can’t apply for a Graduate Support Scheme or LSE scholarship once you’ve joined the School.\nPlease note: we do expect students who register for a programme to have sufficient funds for the duration.\nGovernment tuition fee loans and external funding\nThe UK Government offers a postgraduate loan for eligible students studying for a first master’s programme. This is designed to help with fees and living costs. Some other governments and organisations also offer tuition fee loan schemes.\nFind out more about tuition fee loans.\nFurther information\nLearn more\nabout fees and funding opportunities.\nThe average taught course contact hours per half unit is 20-30 hours and a full unit is 40-60 hours. This includes sessions such as lectures, classes, seminars or workshops, which may include a combination of online and on-campus teaching delivery. Hours vary according to courses and you can view indicative details in the Calendar within the Teaching section of each course guide.\nYou're also expected to complete independent study outside of class time. This varies depending on the programme, but requires you to manage the majority of your study time yourself, by engaging in activities such as reading, note-taking, thinking and research.\nTeaching staff are leading researchers in the field; several are involved at the highest level in advising government and regulatory agencies. The compulsory course is taught across all members of the MSc Regulation team. You can view indicative details for the teacher responsible for each course in the relevant course guide.\nThere are also regular talks from practitioners in the field to attend as well as seminars and conferences inside and outside the School. The Centre for Analysis of Risk and Regulation offers many opportunities to take part in leading-edge research.\nAcademic mentor: you’ll meet with your academic mentor regularly to discuss your work. Your mentor can provide advice and guidance on academic issues and, where appropriate, personal concerns.\nOther academic support: at LSE, we offer lots of opportunities to extend your learning outside the classroom.\nLSE LIFE is a great place to get advice and practise the skills you’ll need during your studies and beyond.\nThrough LSE LIFE, you can:\nDisability and Mental Health Service: we want all LSE students to achieve their full potential. Students can access free, confidential advice through our Disability and Mental Health Service. This is the first point of contact for students.\nAll taught courses are required to include formative coursework which is unassessed. It's designed to help prepare you for summative assessment which counts towards the course mark and to the degree award. LSE uses a range of formative assessment, such as essays, problem sets, case studies, reports, quizzes, mock exams and many others. Summative assessment may be conducted during the course or by final examination at the end of the course (which in some cases may be offered online). An indication of the formative coursework and summative assessment for each course can be found in the relevant course guide.\nGraduates from the MSc Regulation have gone on to successful careers in politics and government, regulatory bodies, international organisations, law, finance and other regulated services, the media, non-governmental organisations and academia.\nFurther information on graduate destinations for this programme\nFrom CV workshops through to careers fairs, LSE offers lots of information and support to help you make that all-important step from education into work.\nMany of the UK’s top employers give careers presentations at the School during the year and there are numerous workshops covering topics such as job hunting, managing interviews, writing a cover letter and using LinkedIn.\nSee LSE Careers for further details.\n• Introduction\n• Preliminary readings\n• R Baldwin, M Cave and M Lodge Understanding Regulation (Oxford University Press, 2012)\n• M Lodge and K Wegrich, Managing Regulation, (Palgrave, 2012)\n• Overseas\n• Year 1\n• Meet the department\n• Why LSE\n• comparative politics\n• conflict studies\n• political behaviour and political psychology\n• political economy and institutional analysis\n• political theory\n• public policy and public administration.\n• Overview\n• When to apply\n• academic achievement (including predicted and achieved grades)\n• statement of academic purpose\n• two academic references\n• CV.\n• Home\n• Overseas\n• How you learn\n• How you're assessed\n• attend workshops on developing leadership skills, finding the right study/work/life balance and preparing for the world of work\n• develop your reading, academic writing and critical-thinking skills\n• gain experience of working in study groups and develop your cross-cultural communication and teamwork skills.\n• Overview\n• Career support\n• Explore LSE\n[CARD]\nLaw and Politics of Regulation\nLaw and Politics of Regulation\n[CARD]\nLaw and Politics of Regulation\n[CARD]\nDissertation\nDissertation\n[CARD]\nDissertation\n[CARD]\nOptional courses to the value of two units\nOptional courses to the value of two units Browse your options\n[CARD]\nOptional courses to the value of two units\n[CARD]\nDepartment of Government\nDepartment of Government\n[CARD]\nDepartment of Government\n[CARD]\nUniversity of the Year 2025 and 1st in the UK\nUniversity of the Year 2025 and 1st in the UKTimes and The Sunday Times - Good University Guide 2025\n[CARD]\nUniversity of the Year 2025\nUniversity of the Year 2025 and 1st in the UK\n[CARD]\nUniversity of the Year 2025\n[CARD]\nand 1st in the UK\n[CARD]\nTimes and The Sunday Times - Good University Guide 2025\n[CARD]\n1st in London for the 14th year running\n1st in London for the 14th year runningThe Complete University Guide - University League Tables 2026\n[CARD]\n1st in London\n1st in London for the 14th year running\n[CARD]\n1st in London\n[CARD]\nfor the 14th year running\n[CARD]\nThe Complete University Guide - University League Tables 2026\n[CARD]\n6th In the world\n6th In the worldQS World University Rankings by Subject 2025\n[CARD]\n6th\n6th In the world\n[CARD]\n6th\n[CARD]\nIn the world\n[CARD]\nQS World University Rankings by Subject 2025\n[CARD]\nCarbon Neutral In 2021, LSE became the first Carbon Neutral verified university in the UK\nCarbon Neutral In 2021, LSE became the first Carbon Neutral verified university in the UK\n[CARD]\nCarbon Neutral\nCarbon Neutral In 2021, LSE became the first Carbon Neutral verified university in the UK\n[CARD]\nCarbon Neutral\n[CARD]\nIn 2021, LSE became the first Carbon Neutral verified university in the UK\n[CARD]\nStudent life\nStudent lifeDiscover our campus and student services\n[CARD]\nStudent life\n[CARD]\nDiscover our campus and student services\n[CARD]\nStudent support\nStudent supportFind out more about our academic guidance, advice and pastoral care\n[CARD]\nStudent support\n[CARD]\nFind out more about our academic guidance, advice and pastoral care\n[CARD]\nAccommodation\nAccommodationExplore the accommodation services we offer to our students\n[CARD]\nAccommodation\n[CARD]\nExplore the accommodation services we offer to our students\n[CARD]\nMeet, visit and discover LSE\nMeet, visit and discover LSEAttend our in-person events or explore LSE from home\n[CARD]\nMeet, visit and discover LSE\n[CARD]\nAttend our in-person events or explore LSE from home",

Most delays and confusion are caused when applicants do not follow our instructions.\nYou must apply early, as competition for programmes at LSE is intense. Your application will not be considered until we have received all your supporting documents. Wherever possible you should submit all of your documents with your online application. You should expect to wait an average of 8 weeks for a decision when applying for a taught programme; decisions for a research programme may take longer than this.\nImportant:  LSE expects all applicants to complete their application materials without the use of paid agents or other paid professional assistance. The use of such services may lead to the rejection of application materials, the revocation of an admissions offer, cancellation of admission, or involuntary withdrawal from the University.\nUnscrupulous agents have been known to charge large sums to applicants, and then to submit fraudulent transcripts and references. They have refused to allow applicants access to their own records on our Graduate Applicant Portal Applicants have been left unable to attend LSE and having to sue the agent for financial redress. Agents who claim to 'guarantee' entry to LSE are lying. All applications are considered on their own merits and all applicants can and should submit their own information.\nNOTICE: Please be aware of an issue that has come to our attention regarding email junk/spam filters. Some email software is filtering LSE emails to the spam/junk or ‘Deleted Items/Bin’ folder so please make sure to check there for important information regarding your application. If you do find any of our emails in any of these folders, please make sure to add the domain @lse.ac.uk to your ‘Safe Senders’ or ‘Never Block’ list. Emails will be sent to you automatically from our database system once you have begun your online application and as your application progresses through each step in the process (application created; application submitted; application downloaded for processing). We will then send you a further email each time there is an update to the status of your application, including any requests for further information and the programme selectors’ decision on your application. It is essential that you ensure you can successfully receive our emails as soon as you begin your application.\nYou will need to create an account in the online application system using your email address. You should use the same email address for your application and any enquiries to us. You do not need to complete the online application form at one sitting; you can return to your partially completed application by logging back into the system using the email address and password you create at the start of the process.\nYou may submit an application via the online application system only ONCE within the application cycle (October 2024 to September 2025), so before submitting your application you should ensure that you have included all of the information you would like the selectors to review. Any further changes after your application has been submitted must be requested via the Graduate Applicant Portal and will be subject to our current processing times.\nYou must upload all of your supporting documents and nominate two referees via the online application system. The online application allows you to submit your complete application securely and quickly. Your submitted application will not be processed and considered until we have received all the required supporting documents, including a reference from each of the referees you nominate on your online application.\nIf you encounter any technical issues while completing your application, please use the “technical support” link located in the bottom-left corner of the application portal to contact us. If you begin a further new application you will not be able to transfer any information, documents, or references between them.\nWhen completing your initial online application, you may choose up to two programmes in order of preference. If you are applying for two programmes, please submit a separate statement of academic purpose for each programme. Your choices will be considered in sequence, and it is only possible to hold one offer of a place, so if you are offered a place on your first-choice programme you will not be considered for your second-choice unless you specifically request it. If you receive an offer on your first choice, and wish us to send your second choice to be considered too, please use the Add/Amend programmes form on the Graduate Applicant Portal, selecting your current second choice programme as the programme you wish to be considered for.\nIf you are unsuccessful in your application to both of your initially chosen programmes and you wish to be considered for further, additional choices, you may do this by submitting the Add/Amend programmes via the Graduate Applicant Portal and paying an additional administrative fee of £105. You should not use this form to add choices 3 and 4 before receiving a decision on each of your original programme choices, unless you wish to withdraw your initial programme choices.\nPlease note that changing your programme choices after you have submitted your online application may cause significant delays to your application being considered.\nYou are not permitted to submit an application using the online application system more than ONCE in the same admissions cycle. If you submit a second online application within the same admissions cycle, it will not be considered. To apply to further programmes after you have submitted your initial online application, you must use the process above.\nAll applications must be accompanied by supporting documents. Some of these are required by all applicants, others are only needed for specific programmes. Details of specific requirements are given on the programme pages.\nPlease consult our guide to supporting documents for full information about what you will need.\nPlease do not send supporting documents directly to departments as this will delay your application.\nPlease remember that it is your responsibility to ensure that your application is complete, including both references, your statement of academic purpose and CV, your transcript(s), the application assessment fee, and, where applicable, GRE/GMAT scores, your research proposal and/or your sample of written work.\nLSE has developed a number of programmes which are administered jointly with other institutions such as Peking University in China and University of Southern California in the USA. Any additional requirements for these programmes will be listed on their individual programme pages. Selectors from both institutions consider your application, and this means that it may take a bit longer for a decision to be made on these programmes than on the single centre programmes, however we do expect the decision to be communicated to you within the 8 week turnaround window. We will advise you of the decision as soon as possible.\nTo apply as a visiting research student, you apply in the same way as for our MPhil/MRes/PhD programmes, with the same entry criteria.\nWe welcome applications for research programmes that complement the academic interests of our staff at LSE.

We are being as clear as we can about our requirements and there are no trick questions or hidden traps.\nWe ask you to provide the documents as requested (or as close to them as you can manage) so that we can make a good decision on your application.\nDon't overload your application with extra documents - the selectors won't have time to read them and we really don't need them.\nDon't panic about the length of your statement of academic purpose or research proposal - your statement of academic purpose should be typed and no longer than two sides of A4 paper. There is no fixed word limit, but we expect this to be no longer than 1,000 - 1,500 words. Some programmes have specific requirements which are different to this; please check the relevant programme page for information.\nWe offer guidance to help you. Read it and act sensibly on it.\n\nPlease do not send supporting documents directly to departments as this will delay your application.\nPlease remember that it is your responsibility to ensure that your application is complete, including both references, your statement of academic purpose and CV, your transcript(s), the application assessment fee, and, where applicable, GRE/GMAT scores, your research proposal and/or your sample of written work.\n[CARD]\nLSE has developed a number of programmes which are administered jointly with other institutions such as Peking University in China and University of Southern California in the USA. Any additional requirements for these programmes will be listed on their individual programme pages. Selectors from both institutions consider your application, and this means that it may take a bit longer for a decision to be made on these programmes than on the single centre programmes, however we do expect the decision to be communicated to you within the 8 week turnaround window. We will advise you of the decision as soon as possible.\n[CARD]\nTo apply as a visiting research student, you apply in the same way as for our MPhil/MRes/PhD programmes, with the same entry criteria. \nWe welcome applications for research programmes that complement the academic interests of our staff at LSE. For this reason, we recommend that you take a look at our staff research interests before applying. \nWe carefully consider each application and take into account all the information included on your form, such as your: \n\nacademic achievement (including existing and pending qualifications)\nstatement of academic purpose\nreferences\nCV\nGRE/GMAT (if applicable)\noutline research proposal\nsample of written work. \n\nSee further information on supporting documents. \nYou may need to provide evidence of your English language proficiency. See our English language requirements.\n[CARD]\nWe take active steps to scrutinise and verify documents received during the application process. If we are unable to verify independently the accuracy of information supplied, your application may be cancelled and any offer withdrawn.",

If you have a greater need, and you submit a personal statement with your Graduate Financial Support Application, you will be considered for other LSE scholarships which can offer a higher level of funding.\nAfter you submit your application for admission to LSE, you will be given access to the Graduate Applicant Portal. This allows you to track all aspects of your application for admission and will include a link to the LSE Graduate Financial Support online application.\nThe deadline for completing the form for those starting at LSE in 2025 is 07 May 2025 (application will close at 5pm UK time).

This is because we can only assess if we are able to assist an applicant, and the appropriate level of an award, if we have a full picture of an applicant's financial situation.\n• The GSS is a competitive process, due to the large number of applicants applying, the means test threshold is set at a particularly low level.\n• Access to the online application will be provided once you have submitted your application for admission.\n• If you are offered a GSS award, the Financial Support Office will contact you and ask you to provide supporting documentation.

This deadline has been extended from 06 May due to a technical issue which prevented some candidates from accessing the application system. \nIn order to be considered for funding, you must have received either an unconditional or a conditional offer of a place by 07 May 2025.\nAfter submitting your Graduate Financial Support application, please allow up to 24 hours to receive a decision on your application.\nWe recommend that your application for admission is submitted well in advance of the deadline. Read the guidance on when to apply for admission.\nFunds are limited and we recommend you apply for funding as soon as possible.\nWe will use the information on the form to consider you for the Graduate Support Scheme and if you complete the personal statement section, for any other LSE scholarships and awards you may be eligible for.\nYour financial information will not be considered as part of your application for a place at the School.\nHow to complete the LSE Graduate Financial Support Application\n[CARD]\nOutcomes\nIf you hold an offer of admission and submit the Graduate Financial Support Application you will normally receive an outcome decision on your eligibility for a Graduate Support Scheme (GSS) Award normally after 24 hours via the Graduate Applicant Portal. \nThis is because the online application is able to automatically calculate an outcome from all the specific information you will have entered into the form.\nPlease do not contact us before you receive a formal offer of admission. If you do not receive an offer of admission, the data you have submitted will be destroyed.\nGSS awards\nIf you are offered a GSS award this will be shown via the Graduate Applicant Portal.  You will not normally be considered for any further funding from LSE, as a GSS award will cover 100% of your funding shortfall as calculated by the Graduate Financial Support application.\nIf your financial circumstances, fee status, mode of study or programme of study changes, any award will be reviewed and may be amended or withdrawn.\nFurther information on the terms and conditions attached to all Graduate Support Scheme awards: Graduate Support Scheme award conditions\nOther LSE awards\nUnfortunately we do not have sufficient funding to be able to support as many applicants as we would like with awards from the Graduate Support Scheme. Competition for scholarships at Masters level is very strong.\nIf you are not offered a GSS award, you will be considered for all the other LSE awards for which you are eligible, using the information you provided on the Graduate Financial Support Application. \nWe will only write to successful applicants regarding the outcome of these awards. Successful applicants will be contacted throughout May and June as decisions are made, we hope to have notified all successful applicants by the end of July 2025. If you have not heard from the Financial Support Office by 31 July 2025, then unfortunately your application has been unsuccessful.\nPlease note that LSE expects all students who register on a programme of study, regardless of its duration, to have sufficient secured funds to cover both their fees and living costs for the duration of their programme. There is no opportunity to apply to the GSS or for an LSE Scholarship once you have enrolled at the School.\n[CARD]\nIf you are an applicant to a double degree programmes, you are eligible to apply to the LSE Graduate Support Scheme for Year 2 at LSE. You will be invited to submit an LSE Graduate Financial Support Application during your first year (whilst at LSE's partner institution).\nApplicants to any double degree programmes where you study at LSE for Year 1, should apply for LSE funding in the standard way referred to above.\nPlease note that LSE expects all students who register on a programme of study, regardless of its duration or whether one or more years takes place at a partner institution, to register with sufficient funds for the duration of their programme. Since there is no guarantee of receiving funding from the Graduate Support Scheme for the second year of your programme, it is important that you consider alternative options to ensure you can finance two years of study.\n[CARD]\nPlease note this process has now been closed for the 2025/26 academic session.  \nThis process has now been closed for the 2025/26 academic session.  We can only re-consider your eligibility to the Graduate Support Scheme in the event that your circumstances have substantially changed since the submission of your LSE Graduate Financial Support Application and you are able to provide specific additional information to support this, e.g. changes to any figures that make up your secured funding.\nPlease submit the Additional Information Form below detailing the change(s) and any additional information you can provide. This will be reviewed along with your original application and you will be contacted by email with an update to your outcome.\nYou can also submit this form to advise us of any change in your refugee status or if you are an asylum seeker.\nPlease note that the final date that we can accept Additional Information Forms from 2025 applicants is 07 May 2025.",

If you are set an English language condition, we encourage you to book a test at your earliest opportunity.\nIf you are unable to take one of our preferred tests, it may be possible for you to take an alternative test such as Duolingo or IELTS Indicator and supplement your score by taking the LSE Language Centre Assessment.
