If you are considering applying for 2026 entry or later, some of these details may differ.\nSeptember 2025\nOne year full time\nGraduate School\nDigital technology is transforming healthcare. It is enabling faster diagnosis and better treatment of illnesses, supporting improvements in patient care, and making healthcare settings more efficient. That transformation is creating a need for professionals who understand existing medical technologies and who have the skills and expertise to develop new technologies, analyse medical data, and inform policy on medical data analytics. Students from the MSc in Health Data Science will be able to fill those roles.\nThe MSc in Health Data Science is distinguished by its interdisciplinary character and an emphasis on applied skills that will be of particular value if you are looking to follow a career in digital health.\nOn the MSc you will learn about the theoretical underpinnings of digital health. You will look at:\nIn particular, you will develop an appreciation of the challenges in handling, storing and analysing big data in healthcare contexts.\nAn understanding of these principles provides a basis for studying the practical applications of digital health and developing your understanding of how digital health concepts can be applied to solve real-world medical problems.\nYou will learn practical skills in medical data analysis and the use of digital technologies to address healthcare challenges. You will develop your understanding of techniques for programmatically processing medical data such as genetic data, medical images, and patient vital signs. You will also learn about digital health governance and the ethical considerations that can arise when designing and executing medical data analysis studies.\nParticular attention is paid to training in medical image analysis, bioinformatics and modelling and analysis of medical data such as patient records.\nTheoretical learning is applied to real-world case studies, and you will develop an understanding of practitioner and industry perspectives and the work that is needed across academia and other sectors to advance digital health. More broadly, you will develop practical skills in explaining digital health concepts to different audiences and the translation of academic thinking on digital into recommendations for policymakers and practitioners.\nDigital health is inherently interdisciplinary. This MSc brings together academic staff, National Health Service (NHS) colleagues, and industrial partners providing a greater breadth of learning that encompasses real clinical problems as well as the solutions that digital health can provide.\nIn this way you will engage with critical perspectives on digital health principles and practice. You will be encouraged to develop a more rounded, interdisciplinary understanding of digital health questions and concepts. Through research-led teaching from scholars working in subjects including computer science, medicine, and statistics you will gain an appreciation of the technical, clinical, and analytical aspects of digital health and learn how to critically discuss digital health solutions from multiple disciplinary perspectives.\nOptional modules allow you to explore topics such as knowledge discovery and datamining that will broaden your learning in key areas and further develop the interdisciplinary character of your studies.\nSeminars, workshops, lectures, tutorials and independent study.\nAn extended piece of written work that demonstrates a high level of understanding of your chosen area of study.\nEssays, reports, presentations, practical exercises, reflective exercises and exams.\nThe St Andrews degree structure is designed to be flexible. You study compulsory modules delivering core learning together with optional modules you choose from the list available that year.\nIf you choose not to complete the dissertation requirement for the MSc, there is an exit award available that allows suitably qualified candidates to receive a Postgraduate Diploma (PGDip) instead, finishing the course at the end of the second semester of study.\nCourse information may change. Module information and course content, teaching and assessment may change each year and after you have accepted your offer to study at the University of St Andrews. We display the most up-to-date information possible, but this could be from a previous academic year.

More broadly, you will develop practical skills in explaining digital health concepts to different audiences and the translation of academic thinking on digital into recommendations for policymakers and practitioners.  \nDigital health is inherently interdisciplinary. This MSc brings together academic staff, National Health Service (NHS) colleagues, and industrial partners providing a greater breadth of learning that encompasses real clinical problems as well as the solutions that digital health can provide.  \nIn this way you will engage with critical perspectives on digital health principles and practice. You will be encouraged to develop a more rounded, interdisciplinary understanding of digital health questions and concepts. Through research-led teaching from scholars working in subjects including computer science, medicine, and statistics you will gain an appreciation of the technical, clinical, and analytical aspects of digital health and learn how to critically discuss digital health solutions from multiple disciplinary perspectives. \nOptional modules allow you to explore topics such as knowledge discovery and datamining that will broaden your learning in key areas and further develop the interdisciplinary character of your studies.\nMore about this course\n\n\n\nThe MSc in Health Data Science is distinguished by its interdisciplinary character and an emphasis on applied skills that will be of particular value if you are looking to follow a career in digital health.\nOn the MSc you will learn about the theoretical underpinnings of digital health.

      "content": "[HEADING] Curriculum at St Andrews\nThe main aims of the curriculum at the University of St Andrews are to foster flexible, independent thinkers who have both subject-related and generic skills in readiness for work or further study.\nThe curriculum portfolio is developed through research-led teaching, guided by cutting-edge researchers and delivered by outstanding teachers from around the world. Embedded in the core curriculum are principles of research methodology, ethics and responsibility, as well as insights into global and cultural issues.\nThe University teaches not only skills and flexible thinking, but a belief in the ability to use these beyond graduation.\nThe University provides an exceptional breadth and opportunity of choice, with a large range of subjects that can lead to joint degrees. You will be encouraged to try new disciplines while following your own established academic interests. The University will ensure that relevant information and advice is available when students are deciding to make such choices. To complement the key information contained in the course catalogue, academic staff are available for consultation in a process overseen by the Associate Deans, who can also provide expert guidance to students.\nIn order to achieve this, and to ensure that its teaching incorporates the research and related interests of its staff, the University reviews its curriculum portfolio on a regular basis, including programmes and modules. Changes are made with due consideration to minimising impact, safeguarding academic standards, and assuring the quality of the learning experience.\nThese may include any of the following:\nAs part of any such changes the University will:\n• Changes to the timetable, location, number of classes, and method of delivery of modules and programmes of study, provided such alterations are minimal.\n• Reasonable variations to the content and syllabus of modules and programmes of study, including in relation to placements or study abroad, to ensure that teaching is research-led, current and relevant.\n• Suspension, discontinuation or combining of modules or programmes of study, for example, because a key member of staff is unwell or leaves the University.\n• Changes to ordinances, regulations, policies and procedures which the University reasonably considers necessary, for example, in light of changes in the law or the requirements of the University's regulators, or for the benefit of its students and staff.\n• Not providing programmes of study or modules, or combining them with others, if the University reasonably considers this to be necessary, for example, because too few students are admitted to them to provide the required learning experience.\n• Endeavour to minimise impact for current students and applicants by communicating changes at the earliest opportunity, offering reasonable alternative options or cancellation with no detriment, and timing the changes sensitively.\n• Introduce major changes normally in such a way that these come into force at the beginning of the following academic year (if fundamental to the programme, major changes will normally come into force with effect from the next cohort of students).\n• Apply changes to policies, regulations and procedures with no detriment to current students.\n• Be cognisant of students on Leave of Absence and ensure that any changes to the curriculum are communicated clearly and that suitable pathway options are available on return to study.\n• Ensure that the portfolio of modules available for students delivers the published learning aims and outcomes of the programme for which students are enrolled.",

The qualification is achieved when you submit and defend a substantial thesis of original research. You will be supported by a supervisory team of at least two academic staff throughout your time.\nThe School only offers PhD places in areas in which they have active research groups. Before you apply, please ensure that at least one of these research groups matches your interests.\nEach research group's website gives information about the research interests of its members. When you apply for a PhD place, you should clearly state the research group you are applying for, and who you would like to supervise your studies.\nThe University will provide you with a supervisory team of at least two academic staff. Working closely with two supervisors means you will have continuous supervision throughout your studies, and makes available a greater range of research expertise.\nYou can expect to form a close working relationship with your supervisors, meeting regularly throughout your time in the School. Supervisors are responsible for overseeing both your research and your broader career development.\nRead about the experiences of recent research students.\nDetails of tuition fees are available on the University's research tuition fees page.\nWhile you may have the possibility to apply for funding for your PhD studies at St Andrews, the offer of a PhD place does not guarantee financial support.\nThe minimum requirement set by the University for admission as a postgraduate research student is an upper second class Honours degree from a UK University (or an equivalent international degree). However, satisfying the minimum entry requirements is generally not sufficient to gain admission to the School’s PhD programme. Selection is made on the basis of academic quality of the applicants, and you usually need a good to very good first class Honours degree (or equivalent).\nThe School requires that the first degree of an applicant is in Mathematics, Statistics or a very closely related subject.\nThe University of St Andrews welcomes postgraduate students from many countries. To enter the University of St Andrews as a postgraduate student you must be able to provide evidence that you meet the English language requirements.\nTo be considered for a PhD place you must make a formal application via the University of St Andrews online application form. Please read the instructions carefully before you apply. You should clearly state the research group you are applying for and who you would like to supervise your studies.\nAll applications must include the following supplementary documentation before a decision can be made:\nThe School does not require a research proposal or a sample of written work.\nThe School does not have a formal deadline for PhD applications, but all candidates are encouraged to submit their applications in early January in the year they want to begin their studies.\nApplication deadlines for some scholarships and funding may be much earlier than this.\nThe School can offer financial support to only a limited number of PhD students each year. Some of the funding available for PhD studentships is awarded to the School by UK Research Councils, currently EPSRC and STFC. Applicants will have the opportunity to apply for these sources of funding during the application procedure, and cannot apply directly to the funding councils in most cases. A small number of places may also be supported directly through School scholarships.\nFinancial support by UK Research Councils may be subject to eligibility conditions (such as UK/EU citizenship and UK residency).\nThe University maintains a list of scholarships for research postgraduate programmes. Please be aware that many scholarships have early application deadlines.\nThe University of St Andrews has a collaborative agreement with the China Scholarship Council to develop research collaborations between the UK and Chinese universities and research institutions. Funding is available through the China Scholarship Council of St Andrews Scholarships (PhD programmes) to full and joint PhD students in Mathematics.\nThe main selection criterion for a PhD place in St Andrews is academic excellence. It is therefore very important that the School receives your complete application, including references, as early as possible.\nApplications for PhD places and for funding are usually considered separately. Offers of PhD places are not always accompanied by offers of funding.\nOnce the School has offered PhD places, they will then select the academically best-qualified applicants for financial support. Financial support is subject to availability of funds and eligibility.\nThe first meeting to decide about PhD funding is held in mid-January, and subsequent meetings are held approximately monthly until all funding is allocated.\nThe School of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of St Andrews values diversity and nurtures an inclusive community where everyone is treated with dignity and respect regardless of individual characteristics such as age, gender, disability, religion or ethnicity. It is firmly committed to the progression of women, and other historically under-represented groups, in mathematics and holds a Bronze Award of the Athena SWAN programme for women in science. A growing proportion of our Ph.D. students are women, currently approximately 40%. The school supports the principles of the London Mathematical Society Good Practice Scheme.\nThe University is committed to equality for all, demonstrated through our working on diversity awards (ECU Athena SWAN/Race Charters; Carer Positive; LGBT Charter; and Stonewall).  To support the diversity of our staff, the University supports the Staff BAME Network; Staff with Disabilities Network; Staff LGBTIQ+ Network; and the Staff Parents & Carers Network. We also promote the ‘BAME Staff Profiles’ and the ‘LGBTIQ+ Staff Role Model Members’ initiative. For details refer to: https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/hr/edi/\nApplication criteria\nThe School of Mathematics and Statistics is committed to a transparent and equitable selection process for PhD places and funding. The following criteria will be used when evaluating applicants:\nApplicants should explain how they meet these criteria in their application materials and personal statement.  The personal statement may also address other issues such as why the applicant wants to study in St Andrews, in a particular research area, or with a specific supervisor. We will consider the accomplishments of prospective students in the context of their background. We also consider factors internal to the School, such as whether the proposed supervisor is a new supervisor (weighted positively) and whether the research group applied to has relatively few PhD students.\nPrior to submitting an application, prospective applicants are welcome and encouraged to contact potential supervisors and/or the Director of Postgraduate Research (maths-dopgr@st-andrews.ac.uk) to discuss PhD studies in our school, and to seek guidance or clarification on preparing and submitting an application. This will not form part of the assessment of an applicant.\nWe welcome all applications and will assist the selected applicants so that they can thrive in St Andrews. In the event that two or more applicants rank similarly using the criteria above, preference may be given to applicants to a research group where the ratio of Ph.D. students to permanent academic staff members is lower than other research groups. Applications may by unsuccessful if there is no supervisor currently available for the proposed research project or research area.\nApplications for PhD places and for funding are usually considered separately, both using the above criteria. Offers of PhD places are not always accompanied by offers of funding.\nThe award of externally funded places may have additional criteria that applicants are required to meet, e.g.  a particular research area or project, or residency of a particular country.  Details of these criteria can be found in the University of St Andrews Funding and Scholarship’s portal: https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/fees-and-funding/postgraduate/\nPhD applications are reviewed by the school PGR committee approximately monthly from mid- January onwards.\n• How to apply\n\n\nAcademic entry requirements\nThe minimum requirement set by the University for admission as a postgraduate research student is an upper second class Honours degree from a UK University (or an equivalent international degree).

The following criteria will be used when evaluating applicants:\n\nAcademic merit: degree type and classification; at least an upper second class degree (or equivalent) is required\nResearch potential: e.g. previous research experience or employment, published papers\nAlignment of research interests with research areas of supervisors in our school\nPersonal and professional development: e.g. non-research work experience\nOutreach: public communication of mathematics and statistics\n\nApplicants should explain how they meet these criteria in their application materials and personal statement.  The personal statement may also address other issues such as why the applicant wants to study in St Andrews, in a particular research area, or with a specific supervisor. We will consider the accomplishments of prospective students in the context of their background. We also consider factors internal to the School, such as whether the proposed supervisor is a new supervisor (weighted positively) and whether the research group applied to has relatively few PhD students.\nPrior to submitting an application, prospective applicants are welcome and encouraged to contact potential supervisors and/or the Director of Postgraduate Research (maths-dopgr@st-andrews.ac.uk) to discuss PhD studies in our school, and to seek guidance or clarification on preparing and submitting an application. This will not form part of the assessment of an applicant.\nWe welcome all applications and will assist the selected applicants so that they can thrive in St Andrews. In the event that two or more applicants rank similarly using the criteria above, preference may be given to applicants to a research group where the ratio of Ph.D. students to permanent academic staff members is lower than other research groups. Applications may by unsuccessful if there is no supervisor currently available for the proposed research project or research area.\nApplications for PhD places and for funding are usually considered separately, both using the above criteria. Offers of PhD places are not always accompanied by offers of funding.\nThe award of externally funded places may have additional criteria that applicants are required to meet, e.g.  a particular research area or project, or residency of a particular country.  Details of these criteria can be found in the University of St Andrews Funding and Scholarship’s portal: https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/fees-and-funding/postgraduate/\nPhD applications are reviewed by the school PGR committee approximately monthly from mid- January onwards.\n[GRID_TABLE]\nHow to apply\n\n\nAcademic entry requirements\nThe minimum requirement set by the University for admission as a postgraduate research student is an upper second class Honours degree from a UK University (or an equivalent international degree). However, satisfying the minimum entry requirements is generally not sufficient to gain admission to the School’s PhD programme. Selection is made on the basis of academic quality of the applicants, and you usually need a good to very good first class Honours degree (or equivalent).\nThe School requires that the first degree of an applicant is in Mathematics, Statistics or a very closely related subject.\nEnglish language requirements\nThe University of St Andrews welcomes postgraduate students from many countries. To enter the University of St Andrews as a postgraduate student you must be able to provide evidence that you meet the English language requirements.\nApplication procedure\nTo be considered for a PhD place you must make a formal application via the University of St Andrews online application form. Please read the instructions carefully before you apply. You should clearly state the research group you are applying for and who you would like to supervise your studies.\nAll applications must include the following supplementary documentation before a decision can be made:\n\nCV or résumé. This should include your personal details with a history of your education and employment to date.\nTwo original signed academic references - these will be requested when you have given contact details in your online application.\nAcademic transcripts and degree certificates - upload scanned copies.\nEnglish language requirements certificate.\n\nThe School does not require a research proposal or a sample of written work.\nHow to apply\nHow to apply\nHow to apply\nAcademic entry requirements\nThe minimum requirement set by the University for admission as a postgraduate research student is an upper second class Honours degree from a UK University (or an equivalent international degree).

Some of the funding available for PhD studentships is awarded to the School by UK Research Councils, currently EPSRC and STFC. Applicants will have the opportunity to apply for these sources of funding during the application procedure, and cannot apply directly to the funding councils in most cases. A small number of places may also be supported directly through School scholarships. \nFinancial support by UK Research Councils may be subject to eligibility conditions (such as UK/EU citizenship and UK residency).\nFunding offered through the School\nFunding offered through the School\nFunding offered through the School\nThe School can offer financial support to only a limited number of PhD students each year.

It is therefore very important that the School receives your complete application, including references, as early as possible.\nApplications for PhD places and for funding are usually considered separately. Offers of PhD places are not always accompanied by offers of funding.\nOnce the School has offered PhD places, they will then select the academically best-qualified applicants for financial support. Financial support is subject to availability of funds and eligibility.\nThe first meeting to decide about PhD funding is held in mid-January, and subsequent meetings are held approximately monthly until all funding is allocated.\nHow applicants are selected\nHow applicants are selected\nHow applicants are selected\nThe main selection criterion for a PhD place in St Andrews is academic excellence.
