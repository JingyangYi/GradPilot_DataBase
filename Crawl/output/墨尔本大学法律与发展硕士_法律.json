It also offers the opportunity to investigate and analyse both international law and the ‘rule of law’ in a developmental context.\nAs a student, you can choose from subjects that take a range of practical, historical, critical, applied and theoretical perspectives.\nIt’s ideal for those working in international development from a government, non-government or not-for-profit background, as well as for those who wish to undertake specialist study in the area in preparation for a research degree. It’s available for both law and non-law graduates.\nThe Master of Law and Development is part of the world-renowned Melbourne Law Masters program.\nRelated offeringsMaster of LawsGraduate Diploma in LawsSingle Subject Study in Law\nContact-support \n    How can we help?\n• Arrow-right  \n          #1\n         \n          law school in Australia (Times Higher Ed.)\n• Arrow-right  \n          #11\n         \n          law school globally (Times Higher Ed.)\n• Course code:\n         635AA\n• Master of Laws\n• Graduate Diploma in Laws\n• Single Subject Study in Law\n• Law\n• Specialist legal study\n[GRID_TABLE]\nArrow-right  \n        How to apply\nArrow-right  \n        Enquire\nArrow-right  \n        Register for updates\n[CARD]\nArrow-right  \n        Register for updates\n[CARD]\nArrow-right  \n        How to apply\n[CARD]\nArrow-right  \n        Enquire\n[CARD]\nLaw\n[CARD]\nLaw\n[CARD]\nSpecialist legal study\n[CARD]\nSpecialist legal study",
