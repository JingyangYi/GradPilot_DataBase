It aims to describe and understand a broad range of physical phenomena through a variety of analytical concepts and methods,and by encoding them into mathematical language.\nThe Research in Theoretical Physics master’s programme is specifically designed at preparing you for a career in scientific research in fundamental physics. Its primary aim is to allow you to continue towards a PhD in a broad range of topics. Leiden University's MSc program stands out in that we emphasize an education focused on the core of Theoretical Physics used in widely differing subdisciplines from High Energy Particle Physics and Cosmology, to Theoretical Physics of Life Processes and Condensed Matter Theory. The MSc student is free to tailor his/her study program to the specific directions of interest, while simultaneously learning the wide applicability of universal Theoretical Physics concepts in other directions. Uniquely we offer advanced MSc courses organized by the Delta-Institute for Theoretical Physics --- a consortium of the Institutes for Theoretical Physics of Leiden, Amsterdam and Utrecht --- that accelerate the connection to the research frontier.\nRead more about the Research in Theoretical Physics programme.\nDue to the selected cookie settings, we cannot show this video here.\nFind more reasons to choose Research in Theoretical Physics at Leiden University.\nTheoretical Physics is the study of choice if you want to obtain a thorough experience on the frontline of physics research and a practical training of communicative and computer skills required tofunction in any of the modern high demanding data oriented careers in industry, society and research. Part of the research will be developing theoretical models and simulations of physical systems across different length scales, from cosmology to quantum systems.\nRead more about the entry requirements for Research in Theoretical Physics.\nThis website uses cookies.            \nMore information.\nThe Leiden University website always uses functional cookies and cookies to monitor visitor statistics.

You will have a desk at the institute, access to premier research level computing environment, and are encouraged and invited to participate in daily scientific life.\n• Despite its small size, the research at the Institute Lorentz for Theoretical Physics covers essentially all areas of theoretical Physics including string theory, particle physics, electron physics, econophysics, cosmology, biological physics, mesoscopic physics, soft and biomatter physics.",
