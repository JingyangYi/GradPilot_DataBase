More information is available on the School of Engineering website\nOur Advanced Mechanical Engineering MSc enables students to develop the versatility and depth of knowledge to deal with new and unusual challenges across a wide range of disciplines, within engineering and beyond. Within the School of Engineering, teaching is underpinned by research in automotive systems, biomedical engineering, electrical and thermal energy systems, materials and modelling, precision engineering and measurement, solid and fluid mechanics.\nCore modules will provide advanced knowledge in fundamental topics of mechanical engineering and will also allow you to develop skills required to execute engineering projects involving multiple stakeholders. Optional modules allow you to select complementary topics that are of particular interest to you.\nYou will also complete an individual research project: an in-depth experimental, theoretical or computational investigation of a topic chosen by you in conjunction with your academic supervisor.\nPrevious graduates have gone on to work for companies such as Arup, Rolls-Royce and Siemens. Others have chosen to continue their studies by doing a PhD at Warwick or elsewhere.\nA minimum 2:1 undergraduate UK Honours degree or equivalent international qualification, in an engineering, physical sciences or mathematical subject.\nPlease note that applicants will need post A2 Level (or equivalent) knowledge in Mathematics, covering topics such as linear algebra, calculus and analysis, and including differential equations. This could be gained through a mathematics module taken as part of an undergraduate course. It is expected that candidates have a good understanding of these topics at the start of their MSc studies.\nYou can see how your current degree score or GPA equates to the British system in our Study pages in the equivalent scores table.\nWe are willing to consider applications from students with lower qualifications on a case-by-case basis, particularly when the applicant can evidence relevant employment, practical experience or strong performance in undergraduate modules related to their proposed postgraduate course of study.\nTo ensure you have the essential foundations for the course, and depending on your overall academic profile, we may require you to take a mathematical skills test.\nYou can find out more about our English language requirementsLink opens in a new window. This course requires the following:\nThere are no additional requirements for this course.\nThis course may also include additional costs.\nComputational Fluid Dynamics\nThe aim of this module is to provide a fundamental understanding of important numerical techniques in computational fluid dynamics and to establish a critical view on the use of CFD as part of the design process. This module offers an increased depth and range of specialist knowledge in computational fluid dynamics required by IMechE.\nRenewable Energy\nThe module is intended to present and assess some of the important renewable energy technologies and give some sense of the engineering design and development of some of these technologies. Starting with a brief outline of existing and proposed renewable energy systems, the course adopts an active solution-seeking approach, assessing these technologies against economic, engineering and other criteria.Two of the most promising technologies, wind power, and solar energy are treated in some depth as an example of optimisation in mechanical and electrical engineering design. Other technologies studied include geothermal, biomass, ocean and hydro power.\nDynamics of 3D Mechanical Systems\nThis module aims to deliver an overview of important techniques of engineering dynamics, and providing insight into advanced knowledge in kinematics, kinetics, and vibrations. The dynamics of engineering systems important to modern engineering applications such as spatial mechanisms and robots are examined. The complexities of kinematic and kinetic analysis of fully 3D motion will provide an appropriate challenge for the Master's level course.\nHeat Transfer Theory and Design\nHeat Transfer Theory and Design provides a knowledge of heat transfer that is of vital importance in many industrial sectors from process industries, through vehicles, etc., power plant, to building technology.\nMechanical Engineering Group Design\nThe design projects aim to give you the experience of working within a team, and parallels the way engineers often work in industry. You will integrate your knowledge and understanding in order to specify and solve a substantial Mechanical Engineering problem (or user need), through the creation and development of a product, process or system. The project also allows you to develop your understanding of project management, time management, ethics, sustainability, health and safety, risk, regulatory requirements, and intellectual property rights. You will also develop effective communication and leadership skills.\nResearch Methods and Professional Skills\nThe module aims to equip you with the research skills necessary to support masters’ level learning in engineering and facilitate engagement with the individual project through equipping you with a broad research skill set. In addition, this module will provide you with the professional and team skills to support the course and your career in engineering.\nIndividual Project\nThis module gives you the opportunity to demonstrate that you have independently contributed primary data and/or a new analysis of secondary data, within your chosen advanced research topic.\nProjects will be highly variable in nature to reflect the range of topics within the programmes of study but all will provide you with an opportunity to achieve the learning outcomes. Thus, projects may entail experimentation, modelling, analysis and literary survey skills to develop advanced skills in the discovery and occasionally creation of new knowledge. The module also offers the chance for you to pursue curiosity driven work guided by an academic supervisor.\nOptional modules can vary from year to year. Example optional modules may include:\nThe degree comprises eight taught modules and a project. The individual research project is an in-depth experimental, theoretical or computational investigation of a topic chosen by you in conjunction with your academic supervisor.\nPrevious project titles include: CFD for electric car battery cooling system design; Developing and testing an improved solar thermal collector (for hot water); Modelling and simulation of biological control systems; Recycling of materials from spent lithium ion batteries; Biomechanical detection of breast cancer by palpation; Polymer gear contact simulations for EV gearbox applications.\nClass sizes for lectures, practical laboratory sessions and seminars vary depending on the number of students taking the module.\nThe MSc degree (totalling 180 credits) comprises:\nThe typical workload for a 15-credit module is as follows:\nThe research project is valued at 60 credits and students should plan to execute around 600 hours of work towards the completion of the project dissertation.\nYou will experience a variety of assessment methods, and can expect to mostly sit (online or face-to-face) examinations and complete coursework assignments.\nIf you would like to view reading lists for current or previous cohorts of students, most departments have reading lists available through Warwick Library on the Talis Aspire platform.\nYou can search for reading lists by module title, code or convenor.

Monitoring\n[HEADING] Contacts\n[HEADING] Application deadlines\nThis Statement aims to provide an accessible summary of the University of Warwick’s postgraduate admissions policy and procedures, for applicants and their advisors. Where more detailed information is publicly available, this is highlighted below.\nWarwick’s admissions procedures take account of sector best practice including the precepts of the QAA’s Quality Code for Higher Education, Part B: Assuring and Enhancing Academic Quality, Chapter B2: Recruitment, Selection and Admission to Higher Education; and UCAS guidance on good practice in admissions.\nThe University aims to admit students of the highest calibre, who have the academic potential and the motivation to succeed on its challenging courses. The University encourages applications from applicants from all backgrounds and it evaluates the potential of each applicant individually and on their own merits.\nThe University aims to provide accurate, clear and transparent information and advice to prospective students concerning its opportunities for postgraduate study and complies with guidance from the Competition and Markets Authority on Student’s rights under Consumer Protection Law. All applicants for postgraduate taught programmes who receive an offer to study with us will receive Material Information relevant to their chosen programme of study, including details of core modules, contact hours and teaching and assessment methods.\nThe University welcomes applications from all candidates with the potential to succeed, regardless of their background. We are committed to equality of opportunity and our Admissions policy is compliant with relevant equality and diversity legislation.\nWarwick complies with the provisions of the EU General Data Protection Regulation(GDPR). Warwick will not disclose to a third party any details regarding an individual’s application without the applicant’s permission to do so. This policy of non-disclosure will include family members of the applicant. Warwick’s Enquiry and Applicant Privacy notice covers our use of personal data during the application process.\nWhere an applicant requires student entry clearance or leave to remain (a ‘visa’) to study in the UK, failure to take up an accepted offer of a place, or withdrawal from their course after arrival, is likely to affect their permission to come to or remain in the UK. In order to comply with the UK immigration regulations, the University will notify the immigration authorities, where relevant, of non-arrival and of any changes to a student’s enrolment status.\nThe University will publish annually the specific admissions criteria for each postgraduate course of study on its Postgraduate Study webpages.\nThe University minimum academic standard for taught postgraduate courses is a lower second class honours degree (or equivalent). For research programmes it is an upper second class honours degree (or equivalent). Where course-specific entry requirements are higher than the University minimum standard, the course-specific requirement must be achieved.\nApplicants who do not possess an academic qualification which meets or exceeds the standard required for their chosen course of study may, in some disciplines, still be considered for admission on the basis of substantial, relevant work experience, professional training or mitigating circumstances affecting their performance in previous qualifications. The admission of such candidates is subject to the approval of the Chair of the Board of Graduate Studies upon the recommendation of the appropriate Course Selector.\nWarwick is committed to giving full and fair consideration to all academic qualification information presented by individual applicants. Admissions criteria are normally expressed in terms relating to the Higher Education system within the UK. The University publishes broad equivalency guidance for applicants with qualifications from outside of the UK on its international study webpages, although candidates should note that Warwick will make an equivalency determination on a case-by-case basis only after an application has been received.\nThe University will normally require applicants to provide the contact details of one academic referee for postgraduate taught courses and two academic referees for postgraduate research courses, who will be invited to write in support of their application. The requirements for courses with non-standard reference requirements will be specified on their entry on the Postgraduate Study webpages.\nThe University will consider applications for exemption from one or more module of a taught postgraduate course as set out in its policy and procedure governing the accreditation of prior certified or experiential learning.\nAll postgraduate courses are taught in the medium of English. All applicants must demonstrate their proficiency in the use of English in all four language components (reading, writing, listening and speaking).\nThe University will publish the minimum English proficiency standard required of entrants to each of its postgraduate courses on its Postgraduate Study webpage. It should be noted that this web page indicates the minimum requirements and that the selection process is competitive. Offers may be made requiring a standard higher than this minimum.\nThe University recognises a range of English proficiency tests: details of the tests we accept can be found on our website. Applicants will be expected to reach at least the stated minimum in advance of enrolling at the University. The University will verify test results for all candidates using the test provider’s online verification service. The University reserves the right to draw to the test provider’s attention any anomalous results in order for that provider to conduct its own investigation.\nApplicants who have completed a qualification in an approved English-medium higher education institution or the duration of the degree and within the two years preceding the start of the course for which entry is sought, may not be required to provide an English proficiency test result.\nThe University provides a range of English language courses which may support those applicants whose English proficiency is close to the required standard. Further information on this provision may be found on the English Language Information & Entry Requirements website.\nThe University receives many more applications than it has places available and the admissions process is competitive. Achievement, or predicted achievement, of qualifications relevant to entry does not itself guarantee an offer of admission. Course Selectors may take into account any, or all of, applicants’ personal statements, research proposals, references, performance at interview, writing samples, work experience and test results, in addition to specific academic results.\nAll postgraduate courses are assigned a Course Selector(s). Course Selectors are either academic members of staff or professional Admissions Officers. Assessment of applications is carried out by the Course Selector(s) in close liaison with the central Admissions Service to ensure that decisions are made fairly and consistently.\nCourse Selectors will assess each application on its own merits and in competition with other applications. Course Selectors will consider all relevant evidence provided on the application form and the published entry criteria for that course. As noted above, the admission process is competitive and selection will necessarily take into account academic achievement or predicted achievement, the personal statement/research proposal, references performance at interview, writing samples, work experience and test results.\nCourse Selectors may request examples of candidates’ written work, and may choose to interview candidates, in order further to assess their motivation and suitability for the course. In the case of applications to degrees by research, an interview may also be used to discuss in detail the applicant’s suitability for their proposed project.\nIn the case of applications to degrees by research, a Course Selector will only make an offer to a candidate where an appropriate supervisor can be identified, at the point of admission, for the full period of the candidate’s enrolment with the University, taking account of study leave and any other temporary absences of members of staff.\nCourse Selectors may make an offer to a candidate for a course other than the one to which the candidate applied if the Course Selector believes the applicant to be better suited to that course, or in situations where the applicant has already covered some or all of the content of the course they originally applied to.\nUpon the recommendation of the Course Selector, the application and any supporting materials will be verified and the applicant will be notified of Warwick’s formal decision. This formal decision will be communicated to the applicant by the Admissions Service (other than in the case of applications for taught programmes offered by Warwick Manufacturing Group (WMG) which will be communicated directly to the applicant by WMG, or for the MBA/DBA programmes in Warwick Business School (WBS) which will be communicated directly to the applicant by WBS). In the case of candidates being made an offer, this offer will include any conditions which need to be met in advance of the course starting, Warwick’s Terms and Conditions of offer, and in the case of postgraduate taught programmes, will include Material Information relevant to the programme of study. Offers of study are not a guarantee of funding. Applicants will be instructed of the procedure for accepting or declining such offers.\nThe University aims to make decisions on complete applications for taught courses in four to six weeks, and for research courses in six to eight weeks. These timescales should be treated as a guideline only since the University is committed to giving applicants equal consideration and believes it is important that it makes the correct decision. For some particularly competitive courses the University operates a gathered field approach meaning that decisions may take longer than eight weeks; this will be communicated to applicants at the point of application.\nThe second schedule of the Statutes of the University allows for the Vice-Chancellor, with the concurrence of the Senate, to refuse to admit any person to the University without assigning a reason.\nApplicants who have received an offer of a place at Warwick may request that the offer be deferred to the intake after the one they were originally offered admission to.\nSuch requests will be considered by the Course Selector(s), and applicants should not presume that an offer of admission for one intake guarantees an offer for a future intake. The decision of the Course Selector is final.\nRequests to defer admission a second time will only be considered in very exceptional circumstances and where the applicant can demonstrate a compelling need to defer. Such requests will be considered by the Admissions Service Manager (Postgraduate) whose decision is final.\nApplicants with a disability and/or a specific learning difference are encouraged to apply to Warwick and are considered on the same academic grounds as all other candidates. Information regarding a disability and/or specific learning difference provided on the application form is not available to the Course Selector.\nShould the Course Selector recommend for an offer an applicant who has declared a disability and/or specific learning difference, Warwick’s Wellbeing Services staff will be informed in order for a parallel process to be initiated. Wellbeing Services staff may contact the applicant in order to discuss their requirements in advance of the course starting, and to consider what, if any, appropriate and reasonable adjustments might be required.\nApplicants with a disability and/or specific learning difference to courses which carry, upon successful completion, accredited status in a profession regulated by a Professional and Statutory Regulatory Body should additionally be aware of Warwick’s obligations in respect of Fitness to Practise. Further guidance, and a list of affected courses, may be found in Regulation 34.\nIt is an applicant’s responsibility to provide full and accurate information to the University by the relevant deadlines. Failure to do so may result in an application being made unsuccessful or an existing offer rescinded.\nUniversity regulation 6.3 (3) (b) provides for the consideration of information of a non‐academic nature that may affect an admissions decision. A Committee on the Admission of Students to Courses of Study may consider such information and advise the Vice‐Chancellor accordingly. Relevant information may include the declaration of a criminal conviction, activities outside of the law, fraudulent information or misrepresentation or, in the case of applications made to courses which carry, upon successful completion, accredited status in a profession regulated by a Professional and Statutory Regulatory Body Medicine, Teaching and Social Work applications, any issue that may represent an issue of fitness to practise. In these latter cases, a Fitness to Practise committee always considers the information first as provided for in Regulation 34. A list of affected courses may be found in Regulation 34.\nThe University may investigate cases disclosed to it under the UCAS Similarity Detection Service and reserves the right to refer any cases of concern to the Committee on the Admission of Students to Courses of Study. The University may contact the applicant for further information before finalising a decision.\nThe University reserves the right to withdraw any offer made on the basis of an application containing fraudulent or misleading information.\nWhere an applicant requires student entry clearance or leave to remain (a ‘visa’) to study in the UK, they are responsible for obtaining it and complying with its conditions. If an applicant does not have valid immigration permission for study purposes they will not be able to start their course.\nCandidates requiring a visa to study in the UK should be aware that an application to study at Warwick is separate to an application for sponsorship for visa purposes; an offer of a place to study is no guarantee of eligibility for a visa, which will be assessed at the point at which candidates request a Confirmation of Studies (CAS) from Warwick.\nIf an applicant requires a visa to study in the UK, failure to take up an accepted offer of a place, or withdrawal from your course after arrival, will affect your permission to come to or remain in the UK. In order to comply with the UK immigration regulations, Warwick is required to notify the immigration authorities, where relevant, of non-arrival and of any changes to your enrolment status.\nWhen an applicant who requires a visa to study in the UK agrees to the Terms and Conditions of offer, they are additionally confirming that they are not currently, nor have ever previously been, in the United Kingdom without valid immigration permission. If, at a later date, Warwick is informed that they have been in the United Kingdom without such valid permission it may be required to inform the immigration authorities and/or withdraw its 'sponsorship' of your application for leave.\nUK Visas and Immigration require that all international students that Warwick sponsors for student entry clearance must be deemed to be progressing academically from any previous studies undertaken in the UK. There are also caps on the total amount of time that international students may study in the UK. The University of Warwick will be unable to sponsor applicants for entry clearance if to do so would infringe either requirement. If, following the issuing of a CAS, the University determines that an applicant has given fraudulent or misleading information in their application, the CAS will be withdrawn.\nWarwick will provide feedback to candidates to whom it is not able to make an offer when this is requested by the candidate in writing either to the Postgraduate Admissions Service or to the relevant academic department.\nThe Postgraduate Admissions Service or academic department will respond to requests for feedback in a timely manner, although timescales may be longer at pressurised points in the admissions cycle. In cases where the request is received by the Postgraduate Admissions team, it may be necessary for the team to consult with the Course Selector before answering such a request.\nFeedback will normally include generic information to help applicants understand the means by which applicants are selected for the course to which they have applied, but a certain amount of specific information on an individual’s application may be available on request.\nThe University of Warwick treats the possibility of admissions fraud very seriously and our admissions team have expertise and experience in fraud detection.\nAll academic documents submitted by an applicant electronically are checked to ensure they are legitimate before an offer is confirmed. Once students arrive at Warwick, we select a sample of those electronically submitted documents and examine the original. The identity and legitimacy of all referees is also checked.\nUnfortunately, every year we detect applicants who have submitted fake or altered academic documents, fake references, or other false or misleading information.\nThe University takes robust action against applicants in such cases. If we find that fake documents or false information has been submitted, we will withdraw the application and any other applications made by the same person. If fraud is discovered after the individual has matriculated at the University, we are able to terminate their studies under Regulation 6. We will immediately withdraw any future application from an individual who has previously been found to have submitted false or misleading documentation or information.\nWhen investigating potential fraud, we may contact your previous awarding institution to verify your documentation.\nComplaints from applicants regarding the service they receive during the admissions process will be handled in accordance with the Admissions Service's Complaints Procedure.\nApplicants do not have the right to appeal against the academic judgement made on their application.\nUnder Statute 20(2) the Senate regulates the admission of persons to courses of study and the monitoring and reporting of admissions is via Senate committees, including the Steering Committee and the Academic Quality and Standards Committee (and its sub‐committees). An annual report is also presented to the Council. Detailed admissions information is published in the University’s Academic Statistics.\nEmail our Postgraduate Admissions Team\nIf you’re a UK or EU resident, there are no application deadlines for postgraduate taught courses.

the tuition fees for my course?\nTuition fees are payable for each year of your course at the start of the academic year, or at the start of your course, if later. For details on how to pay your fees, please see our Making Payments pages.\nPlease note future years’ tuition fees will be set via the University’s fee setting process in due course. The tuition fee payable for each subsequent year of your programme will increase annually by the relevant inflation, which has ranged 4% to 6% in the last few years. The University will, usually in October of each year, publish on this webpage the tuition fees for a further academic year. You are advised to check the website for further details of any increases in tuition fees. If you have any queries in relation to tuition fees for future years that are not listed on the webpage, please contact email studentfees at warwick dot ac dot uk in the first instance.\nSome courses will require a tuition fee deposit, see the Tuition Fee Deposit page for more information.\nFrom 2020-21 students from the Channel Isles or the Isle of Man are charged at the Home rate.\nHow to find your course fees\nSome of our courses have non-standard pricing structures or are structured by modules - the departments who do this are listed below.\nOtherwise you can search the course fees list -

course, if later. For details on how to pay your fees, please see our Making Payments pages.\nPlease note future years’ tuition fees will be set via the University’s fee setting process in due course. The tuition fee payable for each subsequent year of your programme will increase annually by the relevant inflation, which has ranged 4% to 6% in the last few years. The University will, usually in October of each year, publish on this webpage the tuition fees for a further academic year. You are advised to check the website for further details of any increases in tuition fees. If you have any queries in relation to tuition fees for future years that are not listed on the webpage, please contact email studentfees at warwick dot ac dot uk in the first instance.\nSome courses will require a tuition fee deposit, see the Tuition Fee Deposit page for more information.\nFrom 2020-21 students from the Channel Isles or the Isle of Man are charged at the Home rate.\nHow to find your course fees\nSome of our courses have non-standard pricing structures or are structured by modules - the departments who do this are listed below.\nOtherwise you can search the course fees list - which is in alphabetical order - by entering a word / UCAS code in the search box.\n\nCentre for Education Studies - Part-time modular programmes\nCentre for Lifelong Learning - Part-time modular programmes\nCentre for Teacher Education - Professional Education part-time\nDepartment of Economics - MRes Economics by Research\nWarwick Business School - Global Central Banking & Financial Regulation\nWarwick Business School - Global Online MBA\nWarwick Business School - Executive MBA\nWarwick Business School - Accelerator MBA\nWarwick Business School - Doctorate in Business Administration (DBA)\nWarwick Medical School\n[CARD]\nFull time\n[CARD]\nFull time\n[CARD]\nPart time",
