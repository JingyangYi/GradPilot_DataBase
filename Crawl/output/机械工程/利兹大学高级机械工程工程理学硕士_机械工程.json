However, courses, University services and content of publications remain subject to change.\nChanges may be necessary to comply with the requirements of accrediting bodies or to keep courses contemporary through updating practices or areas of study.\nCircumstances may arise outside the reasonable control of the University leading to required changes. Such circumstances include industrial action, unexpected student numbers, significant staff illness (where a course is reliant upon a person's expertise), unexpected lack of funding, severe weather, fire, civil disorder, political unrest, government restrictions and serious concern with regard to the transmission of serious illness making a course unsafe to deliver.\nAfter a student has taken up a place with the University, the University will look to give early notification of any changes and try to minimise their impact, offering suitable alternative arrangements or forms of compensation where it believes there is a fair case to do so.\nUnless otherwise stated, 'on-campus' courses will be delivered at the Leeds campus of the University.\nThe latest key information on courses, entry requirements and fees can be found at courses.leeds.ac.uk. Please check this website before making any decisions.\nFor further details of the Student Contract please see: www.leeds.ac.uk/student-contract\nPlease note that this link will take you to details of the current Student Contract for this year’s entry. The University reviews the contract with its students each year, so the contract may change for your year of application.\nThe sections of the Student Contract that are particularly relevant to the programme of study are sections 9, 10 and 11.",

Applicants to the following schools should refer to both policies:\nThe Code of Practice for Research Degree Candidatures also supports this University policy and provides applicants for postgraduate research programmes with more detailed information about course-specific selection criteria and processes.\nThe purpose of this document is to set out the position of the University of Leeds relating to recruitment and admission to our undergraduate, taught postgraduate, postgraduate research and English language courses. Where there are variations for the cohorts, this will be explained in the relevant section.\nThe University of Leeds is a research-intensive institution, which creates, advances and disseminates knowledge. Our aim is to develop outstanding graduates and scholars who can make a major impact upon global society.\nThe University is shaped by the values of collaboration, compassion, inclusivity and integrity. The setting of admission requirements plays a key role in maintaining academic excellence and inclusivity throughout the process of admission. Our policies and practice are driven by the belief that the University is enriched by having a body of students and postgraduate researchers which reflects the community at large and includes students and postgraduate researchers from all parts of the UK and overseas.\nThe University of Leeds is committed to providing a professional admissions service which operates with integrity, through clear and transparent policies and procedures. The University aims to provide fair and equitable access to all prospective students and postgraduate researchers who have the potential to benefit from and contribute to academic life at the University. The University recognises that it may need to demonstrate a flexible approach and, where appropriate, make adjustments for individual applicants. This includes, but is not limited to, the widening access interventions outlined in the University’s Access and Participation Plan.\nThe University is committed to providing accurate and clear information to support applicants to make an informed decision about their course. The University requires academic schools to publish guideline entry requirements for all courses. All offer letters must also include full details of any conditions an applicant must meet to be accepted on to a course.\nFor consistency and fairness, the general principles and procedures in this policy apply to all academic schools. Some schools also publish additional admissions policies or admissions guidance, which support this main University policy and provide more detail about course-specific selection criteria and processes.\nVisit Course Search for details of any additional policy or guidance specific to a foundation, undergraduate, taught postgraduate or pre-sessional English language course. Additional information may also be found on the relevant school or faculty website, the International Foundation Year website, the Foundation courses website and the Language Centre website, as appropriate.\nFor postgraduate research programmes, see the postgraduate research applying page or relevant graduate school website. For Incoming Study Abroad (ISA), see the ISA applying webpage, or, for the Leeds International Summer School (LISS), see the LISS applying webpage. For General English courses, see the General English pages on the Language Centre website.\nThe University’s admissions policies are consistent with the QAA’s Code on Admissions, Recruitment and Widening Access and comply with current equality laws affecting the admission of students and Chapter B11, Research Degrees, of the QAA’s Quality Code. The admissions process is covered by the University’s Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Strategy.\nThis policy is reviewed annually and overseen by the University’s Portfolio, Programmes and Recruitment Committee for taught courses and by the University’s Postgraduate Research Recruitment Group for research programmes.\nPolicies and procedures for the admission of students and postgraduate researchers may be revised in line with changes to the internal and external admissions environment. For example, the University continually develops its widening access strategy and processes in line with Office for Students (OfS) guidance and the University’s value of inclusivity.\nAny amendments made to this policy after the point of publication will be summarised in the Version control section at the bottom of the Applying section.\nAdmissions decisions at the University of Leeds are made by academic schools and/or faculties in order to admit applicants who have the potential to succeed on course. The Admissions Service, provided by professional services staff, is responsible for managing the admissions procedures in line with the University’s admissions policies, providing support and advice to its staff, enquirers, and applicants.\nThe Admissions Service is part of Integrated Student Recruitment (ISR), which also comprises Marketing, Educational Engagement and the International Office. ISR colleagues work together and alongside academic staff to deliver the University’s recruitment strategy.\nAdmissions tutors and Directors of Postgraduate Research Studies, as relevant, work collaboratively with admissions and marketing colleagues in delivering the academic elements of the recruitment strategy and the faculty/school offer-making strategy.\nThis work includes reviewing and implementing school admissions policies/guidance through faculty recruitment committees or groups.\nAll members of academic and professional services staff with responsibility for the admissions process are given appropriate training and guidance on national or institutional changes to admissions policy or procedures.\nThe University operates a Policy on Dignity and Mutual Respect (PDF), by which all staff, students, postgraduate researchers and third parties, including prospective students, are expected to abide. The University reserves the right to withdraw an application if behaviours are deemed to have contravened this policy.\nBy submitting an application to the University of Leeds, including via UCAS (Universities and Colleges Admissions Service), applicants are confirming that the information given is true, complete and accurate. At any point from the start of the application process, continuing through the offer stage and on to when an applicant becomes a student, applicants should not:\nIf the University is unable to verify any information and/or documentation provided, additional checks or information may be required.

Visit Course Search to find the fees for your course.\nPostgraduate fees are not regulated by the UK government so decisions on UK undergraduate fees do not apply to postgraduate fees. Our postgraduate fees are set independently and reviewed on an annual basis.\nFind out when to pay your fees and the payment options we offer.\nIf you are a Masters applicant to Leeds who needs a Student visa to study in the UK, you will need to pay a tuition fee deposit.\nIf you are a former student of the University of Leeds you may be eligible for a 10% alumni tuition fee bursary.\nIf you are studying part-time, the full-time fee is generally split so payment is divided equally across each year of study. For example if your part-time course is two years long you will pay half each year. However, this is not always the case so please check with the admission team for your course.\nIf your course is 100% online, you may be able to pay on a module-by-module basis. Please check with the admissions tutor for your chosen course - contact details are listed for each course.\nThe majority of part-time postgraduate Masters fees are fixed at the point of entry and will not rise in subsequent years of the course. This means you can more easily plan your finances at the outset.\nYou are classified as either a \"home\" or \"international\" student for the purpose of assessing tuition fees. Only certain categories of students will be charged the \"home\" tuition fee. Where it is not clear from your application form whether you have \"home\" or \"international\" status, we will carry out a fees assessment. For further information and advice, you can consult the UK Council for International Student Affairs (UKCISA).\nThe information provided is for general guidance purposes only. The University believes the information provided is accurate at the time of publication. The University cannot accept liability for any inaccuracies.\nYou need to make arrangements to pay your tuition fees before the start of the academic year or you won't be able to register. Find out more about how to pay your tuition fees on our website For Students.\nYou become liable to pay tuition fees when you register on your course. If you leave before the end of your course, we calculate your fees based on your leaving date. Read more about tuition fee liability on our website For Students.\nIf you have a question about fee payment contact the Student Fees team:\nIf you are supported by your government, employer, or other sponsor, you should provide a letter from them addressed to the University, confirming that the fees will be paid directly. Sponsors cannot pay by instalments.\nFor more detail, see our information for sponsored students on our For Students website.\n• Phone the Student Fees team:  0113 343 6700\n• Email the Student fees team: pgfees@leeds.ac.uk",
