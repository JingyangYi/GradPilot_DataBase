The basic degree requirements are designed to ensure that the students develop a rigorous appreciation of mathematics, and have a broad exposure to fields of engineering and science outside of their immediate area of interest.\nThe PhD program requires six quarters of course work beyond the bachelor's degree and the successful completion of a dissertation after at least six quarters devoted to research. Students entering the PhD program directly after completion of a bachelor's degree are not required to obtain an MS but may choose to do so.\nThe PhD program typically takes four to five years to complete.\nJump to a Section\nReturn to Top\nAll PhD students must meet at least one of the following teaching experience requirements: (1) serve as an instructor of an undergraduate course, (2) serve as a full-time teaching assistant (20 hours a week) in an undergraduate course for at least one quarter, or (3) serve as a part-time teaching assistant (6-8 hours a week) in an undergraduate course for at least three quarters. The PhD students should register for either GEN_ENG 546-0 “Teaching Experience” (1.0 units) for activities that fall under (1) and (2); or GEN_ENG 545-0 “Teaching Experience” (0.34 units) for activities that fall under (3).\nReturn to Top\nAll international PhD students whose primary language is not English are required to take the Versant English Test after arriving at Northwestern. Students whose countries of origin are Australia, Canada, New Zealand, or the United Kingdom are exempt. Versant test results will be released to students, their departments, and The Graduate School. A score of 65 or higher (out of a total of 80) meets The Graduate School’s English proficiency requirement.\nLow-scoring students will be assigned to participate in a mandatory supplemental English language curriculum offered by English Language Programs https://www.elp.northwestern.edu/index.html .\nReturn to Top\nEight quarters of full-time registration consecutively over two years, including summers, are required. Full-time registration requires enrollment in a combination of course units and ME 590 (research) units for a total of three to four units each quarter.\nAfter residency has been obtained, full-time registration is maintained at a reduced tuition by registering for TGS 500 (Advanced Doctoral Study). Courses related to the student’s area of study may be taken in addition to TGS 500, up to a maximum of four course units per quarter subject to the approval of the adviser.\nReturn to Top\nStudents are admitted to candidacy for the PhD degree by passing:\nReturn to Top\nAll PhD students shall pass an oral research qualification exam that tests their research ability. Students who enter with MS degree or BS degree shall take the exam before the end of the fifth or seventh quarter of full-time graduate study, respectively. Taking the exam sooner is encouraged.\nWith the consensus of adviser, PhD students who enter with BS degree may consider to first obtain an MS degree and use the MS thesis exam as a substitute for the PhD research qualification exam. Any requests for changes to the regular deadline require prior approval of the Committee of Graduate Studies.\nThe exam consists of a 30-minute presentation by the student and 30 minutes of questions by the faculty committee. The purpose of the exam is to demonstrate the ability to define a research problem, explain its relevance in scientific terms, and articulate current research challenges and a methodology to address such challenges, as well as for the student to demonstrate an understanding of the underlying fundamental concepts related to the research topic. A two-page abstract should be provided to the committee a week before the exam.\nStudents should register for at least two units of ME 590 before the exam. A student who does not pass the exam on the first attempt may:\nThe examination committee will consist of at least three faculty members who are members of the graduate faculty. A student’s faculty adviser will serve on the committee but will not be its chair. At least one member of the committee should be from a subdiscipline outside the student’s area of specialization. The composition of the examination committee is subject to the final approval by Graduate Studies Committee.\nThe examination committee's recommendation to pass or fail students will be voted on by the entire tenure-track ME faculty, whose decision will be final.\nReturn to Top\nStudents are eligible to take the dissertation proposal exam when all but three of the courses required for PhD have been taken (see GPA requirement below). Students are admitted to candidacy for the PhD degree by passing an oral qualifying exam.  The oral qualifying examination will be based on (but not restricted to) a written research proposal (no more than 30 pages in total length, double spaced) prepared by the student, a proposal presentation made by student, and an oral examination administered by the examination committee.\nStudents must take the dissertation proposal examination no later than the end of the second year of full-time study beyond the MS degree or the end of the third year of full-time study beyond the BS degree. Students who fail the examination may, upon the recommendation of their committee, retake it within one quarter. Students who do not pass the re-examination shall not continue in the PhD program.\nThe examination committee is normally the advisory committee of a student. Each committee should consist of at least three faculty members who are also members of graduate faculty. At least one of the members must be from outside of the ME department. The committee normally conducts the final examination for the PhD at a later date.\nThe chairperson of the committee must be a graduate faculty member and is generally the student’s adviser. If the chairperson is not a ME faculty member, a ME faculty member must be identified to serve as the co-chair of the committee. Any faculty member may request the privilege of serving on the committee for a particular student. Formation of an examination committee is subject to the approval of both the ME department and The Graduate School.\nReturn to Top\nGPA is determined by all post-BS courses taken at Northwestern toward satisfying the course requirements above, excluding research and seminar units. All but one ME 499 may be used toward the overall GPA. Students whose GPA falls short of a 3.5 average shall be required to take an oral and/or written preparatory examination prior to the oral qualifying examination. These examinations will be administered by a committee consisting of at least three faculty members appointed by the department chair.\nThe student's adviser shall not serve on the preparatory examination committee. The committee will inform the students involved as to the form and content of the examination beforehand. The result of the examination will be decided by the committee in consultation with the student's adviser and the department chair. Students who fail the preparatory examination shall not continue in the PhD program.\nReturn to Top\nA written dissertation on the research project that is satisfactory to the student's faculty adviser, the advisory committee, and meets the University's requirements, is required.\nReturn to Top\nAn oral examination by the examination committee of faculty including the student's adviser addressing the research is required.

The MS program is more suitable for students who are interested only in that degree. An MS degree is not required for admission to the PhD program in mechanical engineering.\nMost entering PhD graduate students have only a BS degree. An MS degree is not required for admission and need not be earned prior to earning a PhD.\nStudents whose goal is to obtain a PhD should apply directly to that program since students are accepted to it directly with only a BS. Note that the PhD program is considerably more competitive and requires a much stronger application for acceptance. MS students are very rarely able to transfer to the PhD program as the MS program is intended to be a terminal degree program.\nReturn to Top\nDeadline for receipt of online applications is July 21, 2025. Admission decisions are made on a rolling basis for applicants that apply earlier.\nWe admit graduate students to begin in September (fall quarter) only. This timing provides the most flexibility in adviser selection and provides eligibility for an internship during the summer months for international students. An exception can be made under special circumstances at the discretion of the MS Program Director for outstanding students that are already in the USA.\nReturn to Top\nNo. Only the online application is available.\nAdditional information and the online application are available through The Graduate School. All supporting materials must be submitted online. Information regarding these materials are on these webpages:\nWe consider prior academic performance, research and other professional experience, and overall potential to pursue graduate study successfully in our department. For foreign students from non-English speaking countries, the TOEFL scores are also important.\nThe institution code for Northwestern for either test is 1565. The department code is not used by Northwestern graduate admissions.\nThe only test with a fixed minimum is the TOEFL (for non-native English speakers), which requires a minimum score of 90 on the Internet-based test, 233 on the computer-based test, and 577 on the paper-based test. Alternatively, a minimum score of 7 is accepted for the IELTS.\nThe GPAs of admitted students are usually high, but GPAs are evaluated considering the institution where it was earned.\nMost recently, approximately 20% of more than 330 applicants were offered admission to the MS program. The program continues to grow. In the fall 2016, over 30 new students entered the MS program which had a total of 45 students including Northwestern BS/MS students. More than half of current MS students are international students, and we do not have a fixed limit on the number of international students we accept.\nYou may submit recommendations from people who were not course instructors, but you should have at least one recommendation from someone who can comment on your academic abilities.\nYes. We have had several successful MS students who had college degrees in other fields. However, applicants must have a sufficient math and science background such that they are able to take at least upper division (junior and senior level = Northwestern 300-level courses) engineering courses when they enter because lower division courses cannot be used for credit towards an MS degree. Students without an engineering BS should expect to take longer to complete requirements for the MS degree.\nWe accept applicants who already have a master's degree if their desired program of study is substantially different from their previous MS program. For example, a student with a more conventional MS in ME may apply for a second MS with the new Energy and Sustainability option. We also have accepted students with master's degrees in fields other than ME.\nThe ME department will notify both admitted and denied applicants by email when a decision has been rendered. Applicants may also check on their application status through the TGS application website. In addition, The Graduate School may notify that a decision has been made, but the TGS email notification will not indicate acceptance, so it will be necessary for applicants to view the decision through the Apply Yourself system.\nReturn to Top\nThe TOEFL may be waived for an international applicant who completes a BS or MS degree where English is the native language\nQuestions should be directed to the graduate studies director for the Department of Mechanical Engineering. In addition, we have a great graduate student organization, MEGSS, where you can contact our current graduate students.\nAdditional information, support and resources for international students can be found at Northwestern's International Office.\nReturn to Top\nThe Graduate School provides information about tuition amount and estimated costs of living.\nNo. All MS students must pay full tuition. A few continuing MS students have been hired for paid research positions or as course graders, but entering MS students are not offered these positions. Some MS students have their own external funding. Underrepresented minority students are encouraged to apply to the GEM MS Engineering Fellowship program.\nReturn to Top\nYes. In general, applicants should schedule a visit after they have been accepted to the program, but in some cases we are willing to accommodate visits in advance of admissions.

Aid is available in the form of fellowships, research assistantships, or teaching assistantships; each covers tuition and provides a stipend.\nNew PhD applicants will be automatically considered for fellowship support; no separate application is necessary for financial aid.\nFellowships are available to students intending to pursue a PhD program. The Walter P. Murphy and Royal E. Cabell Fellowships are endowed fellowships that enable outstanding students to pursue their first year of graduate study with no teaching or research obligations. Terminal year Cabell Fellowships are available on a competitive basis for students completing their PhD studies to enable them to focus entirely on their dissertation during their final year.\nFellowships for underrepresented minority group members are available for new and continuing students, both as part of the Murphy Fellowships and through external awards such as the Illinois Minority Graduate Incentive Program.\nResearch assistantships are offered to PhD students. A few MS students (but usually not entering students) are able to find positions as paid research assistants, but these RAs do not include tuition waivers. Research assistantships are funded by grants or contracts secured by individual professors.\nResearch assistants work closely with their advisers, and the majority of their efforts are devoted to thesis research. Some new students and most continuing students are supported through research assistantships.\nTeaching assistantships are offered to well-qualified graduate students. These are usually temporary assignments requiring about 20 hours per week of student contact, recitation, and grading. New and continuing students may be considered for teaching assistantships.\nStudents whose native language is not English must score a minimum of 50 on the Test of Spoken English (TSE) and 65 or higher on the Versant English test, to be considered for a teaching assistantship.\nMechanical engineering graduate students are eligible for a variety of externally supported fellowships.

They were all eager to teach me everything and really embraced me as part of the team. It was amazing how quickly they brought me up to speed and taught me how everything worked. It felt like I was truly a member of the team.”\n“\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIt [co-op] exposed me to two different sides of my major and narrowed down what I want to do in my future career. I was able to experience both the research side of my major, biomedical engineering, and also the research and development for medical devices. I got to see two different doors. Essentially, that helped me narrow down what I want to do in the future.”\n“\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI built a lot of connections in the industry. It’s a lot easier to do that once you’re inside than from the outside. Having almost a year of experience comes in handy. You really build more meaningful connections in a co-op experience because they are really invested in watching you grow.”\n“\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBeing in a data analyst co-op helped me see what the role actually means and how to be responsible. I think that part is really important. Also, I connected with very amazing coworkers and supervisors.”\n“\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCo-ops presented a really interesting option as I started to look at internships, because you stay at a company longer. The projects you work on are bigger in scope and can last for months, rather than just 10 weeks.”\n“\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tParticipating in co-ops has helped me understand the meaning of my courses a lot better. It helped me see why what I was learning in school was important.”\nWe augment the analytical core of engineering with design, entrepreneurship, leadership, personal development, and unusual collaborations to imagine what's next and take the world in a whole new direction.Learn More\n• TueSep 23Grad Career Lab: Resume Strategies\n• WedSep 24Grad Career Lab: Resume Strategies\n• FriSep 26Northwestern 2025 Tech Career Fair\n• TueSep 30Grad Career Lab: Career Fair + Networking\n[CARD]\nCooperative Engineering Education Program (Co-op)Co-op is an educational program which allows engineering students to alternate periods of academic study with full-time periods of paid work experience related to their academic and professional goals.Explore Co-ops\n[CARD]\nInternshipsInternships offered by the Office of Career Development offer students opportunities to gain practical work experience with employers in industry, commerce, or government.Explore Internships\n[CARD]\nResearch ExperienceStudents who are interested in career paths in research and academia have the opportunity to engage in a formal engineering research experience, either at a university (including Northwestern University) or a government laboratory.Explore Research\n[CARD]\nService LearningThe Projects in Service Learning program offers students have the opportunity to volunteer their time and engineering skills for non-profit organizations.Explore Service Learning\n[CARD]\nConnect with McCormick career advisors, events, and resources\nUse McCormickConnect to view and sign up for ECD events and interviews, schedule appointments with your ECD career advisor, view job listings, and report co-op or internship positions for work-integrated learning.Explore McCormickConnect\n[CARD]\nLook for work and register for Northwestern career events\nHandshake is the central career services platform managed by Northwestern Career Advancement.

Prospective undergraduates do indicate that they are applying to the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science but may select either \"undecided engineering and applied science major\" or a specific major.\nEntering students who indicate a specific major are assigned a professor from that department as their freshman adviser, but they are free to choose a different field when they officially designate their major, typically at the end of their first year.\nYes, subject to prerequisites or enrollment limitations of the departments offering those classes, engineering students can and do take many courses outside of the McCormick School of Engineering. In fact, engineering students are required to take seven courses to fulfill a social sciences and humanities requirement and have an additional five unrestricted electives that can be used to take either engineering or other classes.\nNorthwestern engineering students are encouraged to become whole-brain engineers™ by developing many kinds of skills and knowledge.\nGet answers to additional FAQs through the Undergraduate Admissions Office\nThere is also a Combined Music and Engineering Program, which enables students to earn degrees in both music and engineering simultaneously.
