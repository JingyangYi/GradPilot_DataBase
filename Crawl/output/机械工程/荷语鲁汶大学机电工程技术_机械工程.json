The only accepted English proficiency tests are: - TOEFL: internet-based test (iBT) 85 (min. subscores 20) - IELTS Academic certificate: 6.5 (min. subscores 6) - Cambridge English: Advanced (CAE) or Cambridge English: Proficiency (CPE) exam: 176 (min. subscores 169) Exempted from submitting an English proficiency certificate are: - Applicants who have already obtained a diploma (secondary or higher education) taught in English in Australia, English-speaking Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States of America; - Applicants with a diploma of secondary education issued by the Flemish Community.\nWe strongly encourage our applicants to submit a GRE test as it can be an asset to the overall evaluation of their application, although it is not mandatory.\nApplication evaluationAll applications will be reviewed by the Admissions Office of KU Leuven (phase 1) and the Board of Admissions of the master programme (phase 2). The Board of Admissions carefully considers all applicants who have provided all required documents. If the Board of Admissions evaluates the application file positively (which means they are convinced that there is compatibility between the master’s programme and the educational background of the applicant), the applicant will be granted direct access to the master’s programme. If the Board of Admissions evaluates the application as promising and relevant to the programme, but thinks important elements are still missing in the educational background and level of the applicant, the applicant will be eligible to start a preparatory programme. After successfully completing the preparatory programme, the applicant will be granted direct access to the master's programme. Since the master's programme's duration is only one year (60 ECTS), there is no room to introduce courses to bridge with the undergraduate programme the candidate has already completed. Therefore most applicants need to follow a preparatory programme. If the Board of Admissions evaluates the educational background as not suitable to guarantee a good continuation of the programme and/or the level/academic excellency as insufficient, the application will be rejected.

Once you have gained permission, you can add the course to your ISP by entering it under \"Free selection from the academic offering\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20\nECTS\n\n\n\n\nMaster's Thesis Electromechanical Engineering: Mechatronics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                counter_1\n                                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncircle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nequal\n\n\n\n\n\n                            T4PME2\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\nECTS\n\n\n\n\nTotal Quality Management\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                counter_1\n                                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nequal\n\n\n\n\n\n                            T4ATQ2\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\nECTS\n\n\n\n\nRobotics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                counter_1\n                                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            T4PRO2\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\nECTS\n\n\n\n\nIndustrial IT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                counter_1\n                                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nequal\n\n\n\n\n\n                            T4PIT2\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncrop_square\n                                        Focusses\n                \n\n\nStudents choose one of the focusses from the list below.\n\n\n\ncrop_square\ncrop_square\n                                        Focus Advanced Robotics\n                \n\n\nThe focus Advanced Robotics can only be selected in combination with the option Mechatronics.

The student submits his choice to the study track counsellor.The course IMMAII “International module master of engineering technology” can only be booked by the study track counsellor. Students can book it when they have successfully succeeded a short international course with assessment abroad and only if they applied for it in KU Loket and received approval from the programme coordinator before departure. Students have to contact their study track counsellor for booking it, and follow one of the following procedures: A. They register for this course with a credit contract. B. When there is a match between the content of the short international course and a course or subcourse of the regular master programme, they can apply to replace the regular course with the international course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\nECTS\n\n\n\n\nInternship Electromechanical Engineering: Semester 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                counter_1\n                                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nequal\n\n\n\n\n\n                            T4OSE2\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\nECTS\n\n\n\n\nInternship Electromechanical Engineering: Semester 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                counter_1\n                                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nequal\n\n\n\n\n\n                            T4OES2\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncrop_square\n                                        Transitional Measures\n                \n\n\nThe courses below are intended as transitional measures for specific students.

Students can book it when they have successfully succeeded a short international course with assessment abroad and only if they applied for it in KU Loket and received approval from the programme coordinator before departure. Students have to contact their study track counsellor for booking it, and follow one of the following procedures: A. They register for this course with a credit contract. B. When there is a match between the content of the short international course and a course or subcourse of the regular master programme, they can apply to replace the regular course with the international course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\nECTS\n\n\n\n\nInternship Electromechanical Engineering: Semester 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                counter_1\n                                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nequal\n\n\n\n\n\n                            T4OSE2\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\nECTS\n\n\n\n\nInternship Electromechanical Engineering: Semester 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                counter_1\n                                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nequal\n\n\n\n\n\n                            T4OES2\n[CARD]\nInternship Electromechanical Engineering: Semester 1\n6\nECTS\n[CARD]\nFinite Element Based Design\nThe courses below are intended as transitional measures for specific students.
