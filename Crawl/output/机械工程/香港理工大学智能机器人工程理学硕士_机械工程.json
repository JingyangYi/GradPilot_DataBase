I believe the experience will both strengthen my research capabilities and better prepare me for future academic pursuits.\nOverall, my time at PolyU has been both inspiring and transformative, and I am thankful for this meaningful experience as I step into the future.\nHi, I am Jin Zezhong, a 2023 graduate of the MSc in Electronic and Information Engineering programme at PolyU.\nThe first semester of the programme gave me a deeper professional knowledge and laid a solid foundation for future research. Because of my excellent grades in the first semester and my interest in deep learning, I was lucky to be given the opportunity to complete my dissertation with an MSc Studentship under the supervision of Professor Man Wai MAK.\nAt first, I had difficulties reading the papers and writing code. But under my supervisor’s careful guidance, I gradually learned to read papers and write code. After completing the dissertation project, I improved my academic skills and received a PhD programme opportunity. I am so glad that I chose the dissertation project at that time. I am very grateful to The Hong Kong Polytechnic University and my supervisor. I suggest that any student who has a strong research interest should undertake a dissertation project.\nGood luck to every new student in the coming semester!\nHi, I am QIU Hao, a 2023 graduate of the MSc in Electronic and Information Engineering programme.\nLearning in EEE is fun. Unlike undergraduate study, MSc courses are project-based, which means I got many opportunities to implement exciting ideas and learn practical skills. For instance, I built a seat monitor for the IoT course, a code injector for the cyber security course and a LoRa transmitter for the wireless communication course. Presenting these projects was very fulfilling because that’s when I realised my skills are useful. Experiences like this are very common in EEE, and sometimes I talk about them to impress interviewers.\nAfter receiving an MSc Studentship, I started to work on my dissertation under the supervision of Prof. Man-Wai Mak. To produce plausible results, I went through many iterations of training and evaluation, hyperparameter tuning and reading research papers. This process was frustrating initially, but I gradually learned that trial and error was the nature of any real-life project. Meanwhile, Prof. Mak was very patient and guided me through lots of technical difficulties. Indeed, I struggled a lot with the dissertation, but after receiving the final grade, I knew it was worth the effort.\nThanks EEE for giving me one of the most precious 1.5 years of my life.\nI am honoured to share my study and research experience in EEE over the past 2 years. In my first year, I undertook seven subjects, including communication networks, the Internet of Things and machine learning, which enhanced my theoretical knowledge. The Department has an innovative approach to teaching, as the subjects were provided as a combination of lectures, experiments and group/individual projects, which not only improved my ability to understand the subjects but also improved my teamwork and independent research skills. I also appreciated the rich extracurricular activities and opportunities provided by the school, including the courts and gyms for exercise, as well as the music room and swimming pool.\nAfter completing my first year of study, I was awarded an MSc Studentship, and undertook the dissertation during my second year, with a focus on vehicular networks and intelligent transportation systems. The dissertation research required more self-discipline and self-motivated study than the scheduled classes of my first year, but I was provided with sufficient structure through weekly group meetings, which encouraged me to progress in a timely manner and provided me with feedback that enabled me to improve my research. In the coming year, I will continue to advance my research project and work as a research assistant.\nStudying in PolyU’s EEE Department was an incredible experience. The MSc programme offers extensive knowledge of 5G technology, machine learning, AI, the IoT and robotics. I was fortunate to study alongside many friendly classmates and to receive the help of many kind and generous teachers.\nMy classmates and I studied polar code and planned to apply our knowledge to 5G and even 6G development. We built a distributed multi-agent face recognition system for kindergartens to help parents protect their children, and we trained a quadruped robot via deep reinforcement learning for legged robotic control problems. I was delighted to receive an MSc Studentship from the Department to support my studies and life at PolyU. I will never forget these amazing opportunities during my studies. Now, I am a research assistant in the Department, focusing on reinforcement learning and robotics thanks to my teachers, my classmates, EEE staff and PolyU.\nI graduated from PolyU’s MSc in EIE programme in 2021. At the beginning of my studies, I set myself the goal of enhancing my professional knowledge and chose to do the dissertation project to achieve this goal. I shaped my research plan with the help of my supervisor, who was kind and supportive, and the friendly senior PhD students. My grades won me a scholarship in the next semester, which further supported my research.\nDuring my studies, I encountered many problems, especially as I had never previously conducted experiments in the field of optics, my chosen dissertation field. I discussed my problems with lab-mates and my supervisor and consulted academic papers for guidance. During weekly group meetings, I reported on my research progress or shared papers in the field with the group. In this process, I learned more about optical fibre sensing and improved my English.\nAfter successfully completing my dissertation project, I presented some highlights at the OptoElectronics and Communications Conference. With the support of my professor, I lead my team to enter competitions, and we received first prize in the 6th IoT Technology and Application 3S Competition for University Students in China (第六屆大學生物聯網技術與應用「三創」大賽) in 2020 and second prize in the 7th Hong Kong University Student Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition in 2021. In the future, I plan to work as a research assistant in the Department, and to deepen and advance the research I conducted during my dissertation project.\n• Taught Postgraduate\n• MPhil\n• PhD\n• Taught Postgraduate\n• Undergraduate\n• Undergraduate\n• Application-oriented and practical curriculum that addresses the latest technologies and their applications\n• Modern and flexible teaching approach, with some subjects delivered in workshop mode\n• Subjects taught by eminent international and local experts\n• Emphasis on interactive and student-centred learning\n• Authentic and work-related assessments, allowing students to fully demonstrate their competence\n• MSc in Electronic and Information Engineering (Internet of Things)電子及資訊工程學理學碩士學位（物聯網）\n• MSc in Electronic and Information Engineering (Multimedia Signal Processing and Communications)電子及資訊工程學理學碩士學位（多媒體信號處理及通訊）\n• 7 taught subjects, including at least 4 Core Subjects, and a Dissertation; OR\n• 10 taught subjects, including at least 6 Core Subjects.\n• 7 taught subjects, including at least 5 Core Subjects specified for the specialism, and a Dissertation; OR\n• 10 taught subjects, including at least 7 Core Subjects specified for the specialism.\n• Computer Engineering & Intelligent Systems\n• Integrated Circuits Design & Consumer Electronics\n• Multimedia Signal Processing & Technologies\n• Wireless Communications & Networking\n• Internet of Things\n• An Honours degree in engineering, science or technology, or chartered engineer (CEng) status, or an equivalent qualification.\n• Suitable candidates may be invited to attend face-to-face/telephone/online interviews.\n• Classes are normally held on weekday evenings.\n• Some classes are offered in the daytime for full-time students.\n• The Department reserves the right not to offer any one of the subjects.  The offer of subjects is subject to review and change if deemed appropriate by the Department.\n• PolyU Main Site\n• Academic Registry (AR)\n• Global Engagement Office (GEO)\n• Graduate School (GS)\n• Office of Undergraduate Studies (OUS)\n• Student Affairs Office (SAO)\n• Hong Kong Community College (HKCC)\n• School of Professional Education and Executive Development (SPEED)\n• JUPAS\n• School Nominations Direct Admission Scheme (SNDAS)",

I realised that when I did not think too much about the future, slowed my pace a little, and just focused on what I needed to do day by day, I could see the “bigger picture”. I learned that life is not guaranteed and that we should enjoy every moment.\nAfter graduating from the MSc BME, I worked as a project assistant in my department, and will enrol in a chiropractic programme in 2021. PolyU’s MSc programme was a wonderful journey in my life, which not only equipped me with interdisciplinary knowledge but also paved the way for the development of my future career.\nI consider myself very lucky to have enrolled in the MSc BME programme offered by the Department of Biomedical Engineering at PolyU. This programme greatly broadened my knowledge in the field. The skills and knowledge I gained are very useful for my career development. The programme provides multidisciplinary courses, including biomaterials, nanobiotechnology, neuroimaging, biomechanics, and rehabilitation, as well as experimental skills that can help students to conduct research and complete tasks in the fields of material science, clinical and medical engineering, tissue engineering, etc.\nNot only was the course content informative, but our teachers were also very professional, kind, and patient, teaching us the content in ways that were easy to understand. On campus, we met international students from all over the world. Thus, we not only improve our academic standing but also made friends from other cultures. This programme was definitely a wonderful journey for me. The many kind people I met, from professors to classmates, have always stayed in my mind.\nI feel so grateful to have had the opportunity to enrol in the MSc BME at PolyU.

It is a great vehicle that I had successfully verified my patented technology under scientific analysis to prove the innovativeness of the concept. Through the EngD studying process, I had built a solid knowledge research platform so that I could creatively process my ideas with full confidence. The research result has allowed me to transform the concept into a new practical tool that it can be easily adopted into my business to tackle the current field problems as well as benefit the industry as a whole.\nThough rich experience can be acquired in engineering practices, innovation and breakthrough are difficult to be obtained. The EngD programme has opened up a new door to technological innovation for me, in which creativity, methodology and practices were united coherently and perfectly, after taking courses instructed by top scientists and professors. During this period, I received 10 invention patents authorised by the National Intellectual Property Administration, PRC. One of these patents was awarded 2017 China (small valley) \"Internet + transportation\" innovation and entrepreneurship contest winners Award.\nMy colleagues were surprised by my decision of taking up a further study after 30 years of graduation from my first degree. After a few semesters of hard work, I was able to explain to them and my customers with the latest engineering knowledge such as lean management, road-map, smart manufacturing, and optimisation. They were impressed by my in-depth understanding of these engineering topics. My office is now posted with the certificates that I obtained from the reputable conferences and journals at which I had presented/published my research findings during my Engineering Doctorate (EngD) study. Complementary to my experience in the industry, the EngD programme has helped me contribute to my work with a solid academic background.\nThis programme is a very special and unique offering. Although you will learn a tremendous amount of knowledge, of even greater value is how it changes the way you view the world. With lectures taught by leaders in the field from across the world, and immersive study trips abroad, you will gain insights that will help you realise that many problems are simply just new opportunities. This programme will evolve you. I cannot overstate how valuable and beneficial this experience has been, both for my career and personally in my daily life. I would highly recommend the programme to anyone who wants to take their skills to the next level.\n• Taught Postgraduate\n• This programme is co-hosted by the following academic departments:Department of Aeronautical and Aviation Engineering;Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technology;Department of Biomedical Engineering;Department of Computing;Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering;Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering; andDepartment of Mechanical Engineering.\n• Department of Aeronautical and Aviation Engineering;\n• Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technology;\n• Department of Biomedical Engineering;\n• Department of Computing;\n• Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering;\n• Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering; and\n• Department of Mechanical Engineering.\n• We have a quota for admissions. Early applications are strongly encouraged. Shortlisted candidates will be invited for interviews.

      "content": "[HEADING] Quick Access\nFinancial Assistance\nEligible local students (please see here) may apply for the HKSAR Government's Extended Non-means-tested Loan Scheme (ENLS). The scheme offers interest-bearing loans to eligible students for covering tuition fees. An administrative fee and a relatively higher interest rate are charged once the loan is drawn down until it is fully repaid. Applications are non-means tested, which means that there is no assessment of family's income and assets. For details of the scheme, please refer to the Government's website at https://www.wfsfaa.gov.hk/sfo/en/postsecondary/enls/overview.htm.\nAlso, there are some PolyU subjects/courses that have been approved for the Continuing Education Fund (CEF). Eligible students (please see here) enrolled in courses included on the Government's list of reimbursable courses may apply for subsidies. Please refer to the Continuing Education Fund website at https://www.wfsfaa.gov.hk/cef/en/index.htm for information.\nNon-local students are not eligible to apply for financial assistance from both the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and PolyU. Please therefore secure sufficient funds before embarking on studies at PolyU.\nScholarships\nEntry scholarships may be provided by individual programme offering departments. Please visit the information on individual programmes listed on Study@PolyU webpage or contact the programme offering department for the scholarship availability and further enquiries. A limited number of post-entry scholarships are donated by outside organisations and individuals to postgraduate students.
