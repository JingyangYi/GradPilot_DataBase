(Acceptance as a GNM student does not confer priority for later admission to a graduate program at the UW.) GNM students may take any number of credits, however a maximum of 12 graduate-level credits may be applied toward degree requirements. Note that the credits must be in classes that are acceptable for the degree.\nThe GNM approach is most commonly used by those who have undergraduate records that do not support admission to regular graduate student status or students who want to try graduate work before committing to a degree program. Good performance (3.3 GPA in each course or higher) in GNM graduate classes will be taken as evidence of potential for success in future graduate study.\nThe following items must be submitted to the Graduate School using the online application system:\nGNM students who wish to apply for MSME admission later will need to go through the formal application process and submit all relevant documents. See the Application procedure for details. Enrolling as a GNM student and completing classes does not guarantee admission to a degree program.\nGNM status is not available to international applicants wishing to obtain an I-20 for an F-1 student visa from the University of Washington.

Approximately two thirds of our graduate students study full time, while one third are part-time students who take fewer than 10 credits per quarter.\nTo accommodate schedules of employed students, the Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering (MSME) courses are available online or on campus.\nInstruction focuses on the integration of technological systems to solve practical problems. The curriculum and research reflect the technical diversity of mechanical engineering and meet the needs of our constituents.\nThe Department of Mechanical Engineering offers the following graduate degree and non-degree programs:\nStudents have the opportunity to take master's classes online, on a full- or part-time basis. These classes are taught by the same expert UW faculty, but they provide the convenience of completing the master's degree from anywhere, at any time. We use the latest internet and video technologies to provide easy access to course materials and lectures.\nFor questions or concerns about graduate admissions into the ME Department, please contact the Graduate Academic Adviser or the Graduate Program Coordinator, Professor Junlan Wang.\nFor questions about admission to the University of Washington Graduate School, please visit the UW Graduate School website.\nThe University of Washington provides equal opportunity in education without regard to race, color, creed, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, age, marital status, disability, or status as a disabled veteran or Vietnam era veteran in accordance with University of Washington policy and applicable federal and state statutes and regulations.\n• Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering (MSME)\n• Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) Pre-M.S. or post-M.S. entry\n• Graduate Certificate in Data-Driven Dynamic Systems and Controls for Engineering\n• Graduate Non-Matriculated (GNM) For students who wish to take graduate-level classes but are not enrolled in a degree program.\n• Graduate curriculum concentrations\n• Department research activities\n• Admission criteria\n• Required exams\n• Application procedure\n• Application deadlines\n• English requirements for international students\n• Master's program tuition and fees\n• MSME frequently asked questions\n• Ph.D. funding opportunities\n• Accepting your offer, deferring admission, campus visits, and building community",

Homework and exams can be completed remotely.\nThe online MSME is ideal for industry professionals who wish to complete their degrees on a part-time basis, with most students enrolling in one or two courses per quarter and pursuing all-coursework tracks. At this rate, students typically complete their degrees in three to four years.\nApplications to the online MS programs are accepted during any quarter. International applicants are welcome to apply; however, the University of Washington will not issue F-1 or J-1 visas to students in the online MSME degree program. International students are solely responsible for any and all documentation necessary to enter or remain in the United States.\nThe steps for applying for online master's programs are the same as those for the on-campus programs. Applications must be submitted through the UW Graduate School Online Application. The application will lead you through the required steps. See application procedure.\nCourses in the online MSME degree are taught by the Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mathematics departments and cover a range of topics including analysis, composites, computing, controls, dynamics, fluids, heat transfer, machining, materials, thermodynamics, and vibrations, among others.\nAn example list of available online courses is below. Actual course availability may vary.

Even so, we understand that there may be two or three academic quarters between when you apply and when you start your Master’s degree (assuming that you are admitted). Therefore, you are welcome to apply with a plan in mind to finish the required undergraduate courses before you start the Master’s program. You may also want to explain the plan in your statement of purpose when you apply. This will allow the admission committee to better evaluate your readiness for the Master’s program.\nDo I need to complete all the required undergraduate courses in math, science, and engineering fundamentals before I apply?\nThe most competitive applicants have completed all or at least 75% of the undergraduate required courses when they submit their application.

Can I waive the requirement for this course?\nWe understand that course titles may be different from one University to another. That is OK! If you’ve completed a course that is similar to one of our required prerequisites, but has a different title, please let us know in your personal statement. It’s helpful to include a short description of the course to help the admissions committee evaluate your application. You can also contact the graduate advisor at megrad@uw.edu with questions at any time.\nI have taken a course similar to one of the required undergraduate courses in math, natural science, or engineering fundamentals.

Trying to enroll in these courses at UW as a non-matriculated student is very difficult because post baccalaureate students do not have priority to register in UW undergraduate classes.\n\nAt a Washington state community college: Before registering, please make sure to check the UW Equivalency Guide, which allows you to determine if the community college courses match UW courses.\n\t\nAt another university or an out of state community college: Before registering, please check to make sure the course description for the UW course in the  course catalog matches the course description at the other College or University.\nWhere can I complete the required undergraduate courses in order to apply to the Master’s degree?\nWe strongly recommend you complete the required courses at a Washington state community college (where these courses are offered in the evening and online, tuition costs less, and it is easier to enroll), another university, or an out-of-state community college.

The readiness and completion of the required undergraduate courses is only one consideration.\nAm I guaranteed admission, if I complete all the required undergraduate courses in mathematics, natural science, and engineering fundamentals?\nNo. The decision of admission will also depend on many other factors, such as your GPA and other application materials.

The GNM Program is a very good way to show us you are capable of successfully completing graduate level Mechanical Engineering courses. While on GNM status, students can earn up to 12 credits toward their graduate degree providing they are later admitted. Please keep in mind that in order to re-apply to the program and be competitive, you must earn a minimum of 3.2 cumulative GPA. For more information about GNM status see the Non-Degree Enrollment instructions.\nIf I am not admitted as a Master’s student, can I apply to the Graduate Non-Matriculated (GNM) Program?\nYes.
