I was attracted to the course as it was- and still is- quite unique to provide technical engineering design training.\nMost design courses focus on aesthetics but our MSc focusses on technical engineering competency and its application to engineering design. The experience and knowledge from our engineering lecturers enables students to apply their knowledge to a wide variety of industrial and/or research focussed projects in a range of areas from Nuclear to Bioengineering products and problems.\nAs a graduate of MSc in Mechanical Engineering Design, you will be equipped with the knowledge to tackle both the design of complex systems and the evaluate your design's performance using technical engineering skills.\nAs you learn about the design process closely, you will cover specification development, concept design, detail design and prototype production. A unique course, during your study you will look into highly practical technical evaluation skills - those based on theory, experimentation, and computer modelling, to determine the feasibility and performance of new products and to assess the performance of existing equipment.\nA technical engineering course, this MSc is based around solid mechanics principles which integrate advanced engineering techniques with hands-on-learning to provide a complementary blend of skills desired by employers.\nOurDepartment is a vibrant environment to study, with200 years of expertise in teaching engineering,high calibre facilities, stronglinks with industryand a vision to provide a modern world-class education.\nThe       Mechanical Engineering Design MSc\n is a full time course which is studied over 12 months and there is one start date each year in September. You will develop advanced technical skills in Mechanical Engineering Design that will enable you to pursue a career in both general and specialised engineering industries or develop an in depth knowledge for a career in research in industry or academia.\nThe course unit details given below are subject to change, and are the latest example of the curriculum available on this course of study.\n• View tabs\n• View full page\n[HTML_TABLE]\nTitle | Code | Credit rating | Mandatory/optional\nExperimental Methods (MSc Mechanical Engineering Design) | AERO64021 | 15 | Mandatory\nComposites and Polymers | MECH60102 | 15 | Mandatory\nAcademic Malpractice MSc Mechanical Engineering Design | MECH60210 | 0 | Mandatory\nFinite Elements | MECH60561 | 15 | Mandatory\nRobotics, Metrology and Bioengineering | MECH61032 | 15 | Mandatory\nMechanical Engineering Group Design | MECH61060 | 30 | Mandatory\nHealth & Safety E-learning (MSc MED) | MECH61200 | 0 | Mandatory\nStructural Integrity | MECH63002 | 15 | Mandatory\nDissertation (Mechanical Engineering Design) | MECH64000 | 60 | Mandatory",

If this is the case we will let you know after the deadline date.      \n\nPlease note: all places are subject to availability and if you apply at one of the later stages, some courses may already be reaching capacity or be closed to further applications. We, therefore, recommend that you apply early in the cycle to avoid disappointment.      \n\nIf we make you an offer, you will be given a deadline by which to accept. This is typically 6 weeks but may be shorter. Offers that are not accepted by the deadline will be withdrawn.      \n\nApplicants who are made a conditional offer of a place must provide evidence that they have met all the conditions of their offer by 31 July 2025.\nWe consider your full academic history including which course units you have taken and the marks obtained. Even if you have met our minimum entry requirements, we will take into account your marks in relevant course units in our final decision making.\nIf you graduated more than three years ago, we will also consider the information contained on your CV and any relevant work experience you have to assess if you are still able to fulfil the entry criteria.\nCAS Information\nSelf-funded international applicants for this course will be required to pay a deposit of £1,000 towards their tuition fees before a confirmation of acceptance for studies (CAS) is issued. This deposit will only be refunded if immigration permission is refused.

For CAS purposes, this must show your full name, date of birth, nationality, passport number and the date the passport is valid until, which must be later than the date of your planned arrival in the UK, and the start date of your course.\nIf you have previously studied in the UK on a Student Route Visa as an undergraduate or postgraduate student, please send a copy of your previous CAS statement to us as it will assist with the issue of your new CAS statement. This includes study in the UK on study abroad programmes and any study that you did not complete.\nYou cannot use your CAS to apply for a visa more than       three months before the start date\n of your course. The Admissions Team will contact you at the appropriate time.\nYour CAS number is only valid for one Student Route Visa application.\nATAS Information\nIf you receive an offer from us you should apply for an ATAS clearance certificate if your course requires it, unless you're exempt because you're a national of the UK, EU, EEA, Switzerland, Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea or the USA.\nYour Student Route Visa application, or extension of stay, will automatically be refused if you need an ATAS certificate and cannot provide one. For further guidance on obtaining an ATAS certificate, please see the information in our       ATAS Guidance\n.\nDo not apply for ATAS until contacted by your admissions team, as the information required is subject to change.
