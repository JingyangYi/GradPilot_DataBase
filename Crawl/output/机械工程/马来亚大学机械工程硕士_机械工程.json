In many areas, our students are clearly leading the world in their discoveries and developments.\nWhy pursue a postgraduate degree in engineering?\nEngineering is not simply an academic field that deals with technology, statistics and science. It is an exciting and rewarding discipline that has a much wider scope, ranging from basic science to applied technology. Engineers make a significant difference in the lives of millions of people. Through identifying problems and seeking new solutions, they create and design items that benefit the lives of everyone, from cars, computers and buildings, through to life-saving equipment, the generation of energy and medical procedures. Engineering is not about what the world is, it is about what the world can be.\nTo be admitted to a Master‘s programme, applicants will need to have completed a recognized Bachelor’s degree in a
