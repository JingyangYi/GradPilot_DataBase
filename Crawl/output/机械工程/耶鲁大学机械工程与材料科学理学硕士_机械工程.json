Our research spans from investigating the dynamics of fluid systems and combustion to pioneering soft robotics and adaptive materials. Here, you'll work alongside leading experts to explore bio-inspired robotic systems, investigate nanoscale material properties, develop breakthrough manufacturing processes, and advance our understanding of flow patterns from oceanic systems to space applications.\nAt Yale, we embrace interdisciplinary innovation, where biological principles inform robotic design, and fundamental mechanics illuminate both human movement and plant development. Our collaborations across Yale's campus create unique research opportunities, whether you're passionate about developing shape-shifting materials for space exploration, understanding cellular mechanics for medical breakthroughs, advancing sustainable combustion technologies, or creating theoretical models that bridge atomic and macroscopic scales.\nOur graduates emerge as pioneers in their fields, driving innovation in advanced manufacturing, robotics, materials science, and sustainable energy systems. Join us to become part of a vibrant community where theoretical insights meet practical applications, preparing you to tackle complex challenges in fields ranging from environmental conservation and clean energy to advanced robotics and space exploration.\nWe offer two mechanical engineering graduate degree options:\nThe research leading to the Ph.D. degree in the department spans fields of fluids, combustion & aerosols, robotics & control, mechanics of materials, soft matter & biomechanics, and theoretical & applied mechanics. The Terminal Master's degree typically consists of a set of required and elective graduate courses. Details on the requirements for each degree program are included in the Graduate Student Handbook.\nUdo D.

If you’re new to Yale, here’s some basic information to help you get started.The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (GSAS) is one unit within a large, complex, and historic university. In addition to the Graduate School, Yale has an undergraduate school (Yale College) and 13 professional schools that award post-baccalaureate degrees in law, medicine, business, drama, art, architecture, music, nursing, etc. Each school at Yale has its own policies, requirements, and admissions practices. Each grants specific degrees. GSAS is the school that prepares scholars and scientists for careers in research, teaching, and leadership.Note that all programs at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences have a residency requirement. GSAS does not offer any online degrees.GSAS is home to more than 50 academic departments and programs. The full list of our degrees and programs can be found on the Programs & Departments page. Make sure the program and degree you are interested in is listed there. If you don’t find what you are looking for on our site, check out Yale’s professional schools. If you are looking for an undergraduate degree, Yale College is the place to apply.\nIf you are interested in applying for admission to a PhD or Master’s degree program at GSAS, these web pages will be very useful:\nIn some cases, it is possible to enroll at the Graduate School as a non-degree student. Non-degree students receive a transcript and many of the benefits of being a Yale student, but do not earn a degree upon completion of their enrollment. We offer three types of non-degree program:\nWe are happy to assist you with your application. If you have questions, please contact us. To ensure that your question is answered as quickly as possible, please note the following:\n• PhD/Masters Application Process\n• Why Choose Yale Graduate School?\n• Tuition, Funding, & Living Costs\n• Dates & Deadlines\n• Standardized Testing Requirements\n• Application Fees & Fee Waiver\n• Guidance for International Students\n• The Exchange Scholar Program: to be eligible for this program, you must be enrolled at an institution that has a formal exchange program with Yale.

Click to change.\n[HEADING] A Message from the Dean\n[HEADING] Print Options\nWelcome to the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at Yale University, the first of its kind in North America. The graduate school stands at the very heart of Yale’s mission as a university, and this publication, Programs and Policies, reveals the extraordinary breadth of opportunities for graduate study at Yale. As you peruse it, you likely will discover the intriguing ways in which graduate study differs from the undergraduate experience and the fulfillment brought by this intellectual progression. You have undertaken to explore a field in depth, master an area of inquiry, and learn to disseminate knowledge through classroom teaching. Graduate education culminates in a creative and original contribution in one’s field of study representing the ability to participate in the advancement of human knowledge.\nYale’s departments and programs constitute the center for most graduate student intellectual and social life at Yale. They comprise vital communities of faculty and students from around the world and with diverse backgrounds who share a common interest in advancing a particular discipline. Graduate students and faculty alike gain immeasurably from their intellectual and disciplinary collaborations. Yale’s excellent laboratory facilities, unique museum collections, and tremendous library holdings all enrich the experience of a Yale University graduate education.\nThe Graduate School of Arts and Sciences has worked to extend and enrich the community life found within these disciplines. Interdisciplinary programs and institutes, as well as the events offered through the McDougal Graduate Student Center, the Office for Graduate Student Development and Diversity, the Office of Career Strategy, and the Poorvu Center for Teaching and Learning help graduate students prepare for their professional lives. The graduate school enables students to connect with skilled experts with a shared commitment to careers in teaching, research, and an array of potential leadership opportunities.\nUse Programs and Policies as a guide throughout your graduate study at Yale. It includes practical information about registration, financial aid, teaching experiences, university resources available to you, and the full range of assistance provided by the graduate school. All of us in the graduate school wish you good fortune as you pursue your advanced degree, and we want you to contact us if we can help you along the way. Graduate study is exhilarating and life changing. For well over a century Yale has prepared students for truly extraordinary careers across many old, new, and evolving disciplines.\nLynn Cooley, Ph.D.\nDean, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences\nVice Provost for Postdoctoral Affairs\nC.N.H.
