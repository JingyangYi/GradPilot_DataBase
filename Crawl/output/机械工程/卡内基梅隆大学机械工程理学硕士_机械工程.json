RAs include a tuition fellowship, stipend, the technology fee, and 100% of the standard health insurance premium (if the student opts-in to the CMU health insurance plan). RAs are typically provided by research grants and contracts that are funded by government agencies, private industries, and consortia. Ph.D. research assistants are expected to conduct appropriate research under the direction and guidance of their research advisor. A standard RA provides up to five years of support contingent upon maintaining good academic standing and making satisfactory progress towards degree completion. The payment is semi-monthly and the stipend is subject to Federal taxes.\nThe RA is based upon the assumption that a student does not have funding available from another scholarship or fellowship (eg NSF, GRFP, GEM, NDSEG, etc).

MSE ’63) and his wife Marsha, the Dowd Engineering Seed Fund for Graduate Student Fellowships supports a year of doctoral expenses for multiple Ph.D. students.\nCollege of Engineering Dean Bill Sanders is pleased to congratulate the 46 graduate students who have been awarded fellowships for the 2023-24 academic year.\nA student-driven partnership between Aaron Johnson’s RoboMechanics lab and Gwen’s Girls has introduced nearly 100 grade school girls to engineering design and robotics.\nSneha Prabha Narra uses hands-on activities to introduce engineering and additive manufacturing concepts to local grade school students.\nStudents in Ding Zhao’s lab were awarded the 2022 Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship for their proposal to generate diverse safety-critical autonomous vehicle scenarios using digital twins.\nIn an effort to modernize scientific research, CMU students used only commercial parts and the cardboard boxes they came in to build a modular robot able to autonomously conduct experiments.\n• Graduate program\n• Ph.D. programs\n    \n\n\n           Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering\n    \n           Other Ph.D. programs\n• Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering\n• Other Ph.D. programs\n• Master’s programs\n    \n\n\n           M.S. in Mechanical Engineering\n    \n           M.S. in Mechanical Engineering - Research\n    \n           M.S. advanced study\n    \n           Advanced study degree concentrations\n    \n           M.S. applied advanced study\n    \n           M.S. in Artificial Intelligence Engineering - Mechanical Engineering\n    \n           Integrated master's/bachelor's \n    \n           Affiliated M.S. programs\n• M.S. in Mechanical Engineering\n• M.S. in Mechanical Engineering - Research\n• M.S. advanced study\n• Advanced study degree concentrations\n• M.S. applied advanced study\n• M.S. in Artificial Intelligence Engineering - Mechanical Engineering\n• Integrated master's/bachelor's\n• Affiliated M.S. programs\n• Graduate admission\n    \n\n\n           Frequently asked questions\n    \n            Research applications\n    \n            Research fundamentals\n• Frequently asked questions\n• Research applications\n• Research fundamentals\n• Graduate courses\n• Advising\n• Graduate handbooks\n• Tuition & other costs\n• Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering\n• Other Ph.D. programs\n• M.S. in Mechanical Engineering\n• M.S. in Mechanical Engineering - Research\n• M.S. advanced study\n• Advanced study degree concentrations\n• M.S. applied advanced study\n• M.S. in Artificial Intelligence Engineering - Mechanical Engineering\n• Integrated master's/bachelor's\n• Affiliated M.S. programs\n• Frequently asked questions\n• Research applications\n• Research fundamentals\n• Mock Qualifying Exams\n• Mentorship Program\n• Townhalls\n• Faculty Coffee Chats\n• Happy Hours and cookouts\n• Research paper \n Opens in new window\n• Watch the Video \n Opens in new window",
