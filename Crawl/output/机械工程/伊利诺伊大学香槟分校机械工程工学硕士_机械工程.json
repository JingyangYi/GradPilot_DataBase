We're here to help!\n2025 U.S. News and World Report\nThe Master of Engineering in Mechanical Engineering (M.Eng.ME) program is a professionally oriented non-thesis master’s degree program that provides advanced technical knowledge as well as experiential and professional development opportunities beyond that of a bachelor’s degree.\nOur program is for students seeking to get ahead in one of today’s most highly sought-after fields. Engineers with a professional master’s degree from the University of Illinois are more competitive and see a greater starting salary and improved career trajectory over engineers who hold only a bachelor’s degree.\nThe Department of Mechanical Science and Engineering is known for our well-funded facilities, programs and research centers, as well as faculty who are national and international leaders in their fields. Our culture is highly supportive and collegial while offering all the benefits of a large department within a world-renowned institution. Urbana-Champaign is a micro-urban community known as the “Silicon Prairie” about two hours from Chicago, Indianapolis and St. Louis.\nOur M.Eng.ME degree can be completed in as short a time as one year of full-time study. Online students, many of whom work full-time, have up to five years to complete the program. Whether you enroll fully online, on campus, or a combination of the two, the degree requirements and the degree itself are identical. The application process is the same for both the on-campus and online programs; simply select the desired program when you are applying. Prospective applicants are encouraged to review the online course catalog and coursework requirements for the program prior to applying.\n- Dan Panno, M.Eng.ME alumnus 2022, Associate at Exponent\nSusan RoughtonM.Eng.ME Program Coordinatormechse-meng@illinois.edu or roughton@illinois.edu\nSofia Posada Ceron (M.Eng.ME 2024)M.Eng.ME Academic Advisormechse-meng@illinois.edu or sposada2@illinois.edu\nProfessor M.

This course will cover fundamentals for CO2 separation from syngas and post-combustion flue gas, the most advanced CO2 capture technologies including absorption, adsorption and membranes, CO2 compression and transportation, and CO2 sequestration in deep underground geological formations.\nME 543: Applied Control System Design & Analysis, taught by Dr. Kevin Wise of The Boeing Company and Innovative Control Technologies, LLC. This course covers advanced design and analysis of control systems by state-space methods: classical control review, Laplace transforms, review of linear algebra (vector space, change of basis, diagonal and Jordan forms), linear dynamic systems (modes, stability, controllability, state feedback, observability, observers, canonical forms, output feedback, separation principle and decoupling), nonlinear dynamic systems (stability, Lyapunov methods). Frequency domain analysis of multivariable control systems. State space control system design methods: state feedback, observer feedback, pole placement, linear optimal control. Design exercises with CAD (computer-aided design) packages for engineering problems. Key to the course are the applied/real-world examples and CAD homework problems used to teach and reinforce the learning of the material. Aerospace control system pose some of the most difficult and challenging control system design problems. In addition to designing feedback control system gains, the course teaches filtering techniques needed in real-world implementation of flight controls systems. \nME 547: Robust and Adaptive Control with Aerospace Applications, taught by Dr. Kevin Wise of The Boeing Company and Innovative Control Technologies, LLC. This course covers advanced robust control methods including optimal control using observer feedback, Linear Quadratic Gaussian, Kalman Filtering, H-infinity optimal control, static and dynamic projective control, and the Loop Transfer Recovery process to recover state-feedback frequency domain properties in observer based designs. None of these methods are covered in the ME562 course. The course then introduces adaptive augmentation to the optimal control observer-based architectures in which the observer becomes a closed-loop reference model. This adaptive control methods is completely different from the L1 Adaptive Control method conceived by Hovakimyan and Cao. \nME 598: MicroNano Fabrication Capstone, taught by Principal Research Engineer Joe Maduzia, this course is a hands-on micro-nano fabrication course. The student will be assigned a process topic including but not limited to spinning, exposure, PVD, RIE or ICP DRIE etching. Through in-lab training, the student will fabricate patterned test samples with micron scale resolution, then run a parameter study on the process. The student will then characterize the samples (SEM, profilometery, etc), analyze the results, and present the results for review. A report of the work accomplished, process used, and results will be provided for review. Students enrolled in this course will have a unique opportunity to fabricate and characterize micro-nano samples using modern techniques and equipment. students interested in this class should have taken or be concurrently enrolled in ME487 OR ME 586 OR ME 588 OR ECE444. \nME 598: Electronics Cooling, taught by Dr. Winston Zhang. Introduction to microelectronics packaging from chip to system levels and the challenging thermal issues. Introducing concepts such as junction temperature, heat flux density and Moore’s Law. Fundamentals of various heat transfer modes and fluid mechanics with applications to microelectronics cooling systems. \nME 598: Applied Heat Transfer, taught by Dr. Winston Zhang. Review of fundamentals of convective heat transfer, boiling and condensation with industrial applications, heat transfer principles for heat exchanger design and/or performance evaluations, convective heat transfer in porous media with industrial applications and numerical methods in convective heat transfer.\n[CARD]\nSuggested Courses for the Professional Development Requirement\nENG 572 Professional PracticumCredit: 1 - 4 (this is usually taken for 4 credits)Internship or equivalent experience as it relates to the student's field of study.
