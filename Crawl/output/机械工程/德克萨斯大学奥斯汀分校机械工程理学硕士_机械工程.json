Mechanical Engineering Degree Options:\n[HEADING] View Areas of Study\n[HEADING] Doctor of Philosophy in Mechanical Engineering\n[HEADING] View Areas of Study\n[HEADING] Operations Research and Industrial Engineering\n[HEADING] VIEW ORIE PROGRAM\n[HEADING] General Program Questions\n[HEADING] What is the required coursework for the ME Program?\n[HEADING] Subscribe to Our Newsletter\n[HEADING] Follow Us\nStudents generally follow the thesis option, which requires thirty semester hours of credit, including six hours in the thesis course. Students who are appointed as teaching assistants or research assistants are expected to choose the thesis option. The report option requires thirty-three semester hours, including three hours in the report course. The option without thesis or report requires thirty-six hours of course work. For all three options, at least eighteen hours (including the thesis or report, if any) should be in the major area; and at least six hours should be in a supporting area. The supporting courses may be in mechanical engineering but must represent a specialty distinct from the major courses. Some areas of study have required core courses.\n100% Online Executive M.S. in Mechanical Engineering\nThis 30 credit-hour, non-thesis program is geared toward engineering professionals and administered through UT Austin Texas Engineering Executive Education (TxEEE). For more information or to apply, please see the TxEEE website.\nThese are minimum requirements – committees, advisors, or areas may require additional courses. The courses are recommended by the dissertation committee so they can be taken as part of the Program of Work. Students must pass qualifying examinations before forming their committee for dissertation proposal and defense.\nOperations research is a mathematical science concerned with optimal decision making and the modeling of deterministic and probabilistic systems. Its focus and field of application are interdisciplinary, embracing a broad range of quantitative techniques. Industrial engineering is concerned with the design, improvement, and installation of integrated systems of personnel, material and equipment. Together, operations research and industrial engineering provide a rational approach to engineering and managerial problem solving through deliberate application of scientific methods.\nMasters: A minimum of six required courses should be taken in your major study area. The rest can be supporting courses in closely related areas or from other departments. Certain areas have specific required courses. Please consult the Graduate Areas of Study webpage.\nDoctorate: Determined by the student's supervisor and supervising committee.\nFor more information on course schedule, please review the University of Texas Course Schedule.\n© The University of Texas at Austin | Privacy Policy | Web Accessibility\n• Entire Site Search\n• Home\n• About\n• AcademicsOverviewUndergraduate ProgramGraduate ProgramBachelor's/Master's Integrated ProgramCertificate Programs and MinorsStudent Community\n• Overview\n• Undergraduate Program\n• Graduate Program\n• Bachelor's/Master's Integrated Program\n• Certificate Programs and Minors\n• Student Community\n• People\n• Research\n• News\n• Connect\n• Overview\n• Undergraduate Program\n• Graduate Program\n• Bachelor's/Master's Integrated Program\n• Certificate Programs and Minors\n• Student Community\n• Home\n• AboutOverviewLeadershipStrategic PlanFacts and RankingsFacilitiesAccreditationWhat is ME?Visit UsContact Us\n• Overview\n• Leadership\n• Strategic Plan\n• Facts and Rankings\n• Facilities\n• Accreditation\n• What is ME?\n• Visit Us\n• Contact Us\n• AcademicsOverviewUndergraduate ProgramGraduate ProgramBachelor's/Master's Integrated ProgramCertificate Programs and MinorsStudent Community\n• Overview\n• Undergraduate Program\n• Graduate Program\n• Bachelor's/Master's Integrated Program\n• Certificate Programs and Minors\n• Student Community\n• PeopleOverviewFaculty DirectoryFaculty OpeningsExternal Advisory CommitteeStaff Directory\n• Overview\n• Faculty Directory\n• Faculty Openings\n• External Advisory Committee\n• Staff Directory\n• ResearchOverviewResearch AreasAffiliated Research CentersResearch Labs and GroupsSummer Undergraduate Research Program\n• Overview\n• Research Areas\n• Affiliated Research Centers\n• Research Labs and Groups\n• Summer Undergraduate Research Program\n• NewsOverviewPress CoverageTexas Mechanical Engineer MagazineEvents\n• Overview\n• Press Coverage\n• Texas Mechanical Engineer Magazine\n• Events\n• ConnectOverviewAcademy of Distinguished AlumniGivingIndustry PartnersContact Us\n• Overview\n• Academy of Distinguished Alumni\n• Giving\n• Industry Partners\n• Contact Us\n• Overview\n• Leadership\n• Strategic Plan\n• Facts and Rankings\n• Facilities\n• Accreditation\n• What is ME?\n• Visit Us\n• Contact Us\n• Overview\n• Faculty Directory\n• Faculty Openings\n• External Advisory Committee\n• Staff Directory\n• Overview\n• Research Areas\n• Affiliated Research Centers\n• Research Labs and Groups\n• Summer Undergraduate Research Program\n• Overview\n• Press Coverage\n• Texas Mechanical Engineer Magazine\n• Events\n• Overview\n• Academy of Distinguished Alumni\n• Giving\n• Industry Partners\n• Contact Us\n• Overview\n• Undergraduate Program\n• Graduate ProgramAdmissionsAdmissions Frequently Asked QuestionsProspective StudentsDegree InformationAreas of StudyQualifying ExamsFundingResources/FormsMechanical Engineering Graduate Student Board\n• Admissions\n• Admissions Frequently Asked Questions\n• Prospective Students\n• Degree Information\n• Areas of Study\n• Qualifying Exams\n• Funding\n• Resources/Forms\n• Mechanical Engineering Graduate Student Board\n• Bachelor's/Master's Integrated Program\n• Certificate Programs and Minors\n• Student Community\n• Admissions\n• Admissions Frequently Asked Questions\n• Prospective Students\n• Degree Information\n• Areas of Study\n• Qualifying Exams\n• Funding\n• Resources/Forms\n• Mechanical Engineering Graduate Student Board\n• M.S. - Thesis: 24 hours of coursework + 2 semesters of Thesis\n• M.S. - Report: 30 hours of coursework + 1 semester of Report\n• M.S. - Coursework: 36 hours of coursework\n• PhD without an M.S. degree: 24 hours of graduate coursework in the area of specialization\n• PhD with an M.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering (or a related field): at least 12 hours of graduate coursework in the area of specialization\n• PhD with an M.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Texas at Austin: no additional graduate coursework\n• Canvas\n• Contact Us\n• ENGR Direct\n• Faculty Directory\n• Giving\n• Faculty & Staff Intranet\n• UT Direct\n• UT Directory",

A certificate program is a set of courses that allows a student to focus on an area of study in addition to their major.\nThe humanitarian engineering certificate takes engineering for society to a new level, providing undergraduate students with a rewarding, multidisciplinary program that allows them to focus their learning around communities that need their help the most — from low-income populations to people with special needs. The program combines technical and non-technical coursework with project-based initiatives and includes course options in the colleges and schools of Liberal Arts, Communication, Natural Sciences, Engineering and more. View certificate requirements.\nAdditional certificates frequently pursued by mechanical engineering undergraduates include Texas Business Foundations and Elements of Computing. University-wide requirements for transcript-recognized undergraduate certificate programs and a listing of the available certificate options can be found in the university's undergraduate catalog.\nStudents in mechanical engineering are allowed to minor in any field in which the university offers a major outside of the Cockrell School of Engineering. A minor is not required as part of any engineering degree program. For more information on minors, visit the Cockrell School website.\nThe Graduate Certificate in Engineering Education is designed for graduate students interested in pursuing engineering faculty positions upon graduation. This certificate program will prepare students for the instructional aspects of a faculty career and increase their competitiveness for faculty jobs. Courses are active, discussion-based and focused on applying research on learning to the engineering pedagogy.\nGraduate students seeking this certificate will gain experience in teaching undergraduate engineering courses, learn more about research on teaching and learning, develop their own ideas and philosophy on teaching and create materials that will help in their faculty job search. For more information on certificate requirements, visit the Cockrell School website.\nThe Mechanical Engineering Controls Certificate is designed primarily for working mechanical and petroleum engineers who deal with the control and optimization of processes and systems. Developed and led by Texas Engineering Executive Education, the Cockrell School’s professional education division, the program requires completion of nine semester credit hours of coursework and is available to degree-seeking and non-degree-seeking students. The nine hours of coursework can be applied to either the petroleum engineering or mechanical engineering master's degree.

The objective of the Integrated BSME/MSE Program is to enable prepared undergraduates in Mechanical Engineering to earn two degrees in a shortened time period. By applying AP and Credit by Exam courses, having students take recommended summer courses, and allowing seniors to enroll in graduate-level engineering courses reserved for graduate credit, the program enables graduates to complete both degree requirements in five years.\nCurrent undergraduate mechanical engineering students may begin the application process to the Integrated BSME/MSE Program option in the semester before they plan to enroll in M E 366J: Mechanical Engineering Design Methodology. Admission includes the two steps outlined below. Undergraduate students not in the mechanical engineering major are not eligible to apply. It is expected that all students selected for the program in Step 1 and have been successful in their first graduate-level coursework will be selected for admission in Step 2. Successful completion will be evaluated and determined by the department’s Domestic Graduate Admission Committee and the graduate adviser.\nStudents complete the first step in application for admission to the Integrated BSME/MSE Program in the semester before they plan to enroll in M E 366J: Mechanical Engineering Design Methodology. The Step 1 application is internal through the department and includes a resume, statement of purpose, and one letter of recommendation. Qualified applicants will be selected based on the applicant’s progress to degree completion, grade point average, and other qualifications included in the application materials. Selected students will be notified prior to the start of the next semester of their admission status for the integrated program, allowing them to meet with an academic adviser to plan graduate coursework during their remaining undergraduate semesters.\nStudents complete the second step in the application by either October 1 (for spring entry into full-time graduate studies) or December 1 (for fall or summer entry into full-time graduate studies). The Step 2 application is formal through the Office of Graduate Admissions (OGA). Admission to the integrated program will be based on a review of the applicant’s undergraduate record and GPA, GRE scores (if required), performance in graduate coursework, letters of recommendation, personal statement, TOEFL score (if required), and research experience.\nIf a student in their fourth year is taking graduate courses and would be on track to complete the integrated program but did not apply in their third year through Step 1, they may apply by completing Steps 1 and 2 together. These students will be evaluated for admission on the same criteria.\nIn order for integrated program students to complete both the BSME and MSE degrees in five years, the department waives six semester credit hours of technical area electives in lieu of six hours of graduate engineering coursework reserved for graduate credit taken in the fourth year. This reduces the total BSME degree requirements for integrated program students from 126 to 120 hours.\nStudents in the integrated program complete up to 12 hours of graduate coursework in their fourth year and 18-24 hours of graduate coursework in their time as full-time graduate students to complete a total of 30-36 hours of graduate coursework for the MSE degree as described in the Graduate Catalog. Students have the option of choosing the coursework, report, or thesis option for the MSE degree as described in the Graduate Catalog. The selected degree option determines the number of hours required to graduate with the MSE degree. Courses the student takes will be determined with the graduate adviser and academic adviser to ensure compliance with degree requirements and to meet the students’ career goals.\nStudents unable to successfully complete the integrated program, or who wish to terminate pursuit of the MSE for any reason, may obtain a BSME degree by applying for a change of major back to the standalone BSME program and satisfying all of the requirements for the standalone degree. Six hours of the graduate courses taken in the fourth year may count toward the 12 hours of CGEs required to complete the entire 126 hours requirements. An undergraduate student leaving the integrated program will be on a trajectory to graduate with the regular BSME degree in the same timeframe prior to admission to the integrated program.\nGraduates of the integrated program will receive the BSME and MSE degrees simultaneously after successfully completing the 120 hours for the BSME and 30-36 hours for the MSE, a total of 150-156 hours. Ideally students in this program will graduate with both degrees in a total of five years.\nOnce admitted, students will be advised each semester by the graduate adviser and an academic adviser to complete coursework required for the BSME degree in their fourth year, and completion of the coursework required for the MSE degree in their fourth and fifth years. Information regarding the integrated program requirements and policies may be obtained from the ME Academic Advising Office. Interested students can email Kelly Frazer for more information about the program: This email address is being protected from spambots.
