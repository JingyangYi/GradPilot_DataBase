If you’ve completed the Mechanical Systems major in your bachelor’s degree, plus the required maths and science subjects, you’ll receive credit for these foundation engineering subjects and start in second year.\nIn the second and third year of the program (or equivalent), you’ll focus on your chosen engineering discipline. As a mechanical engineering student, your focus will be on turning energy into power and motion, and designing, constructing and operating devices and systems. You will focus on fluid mechanics, turbulence and biomechanics.\nYou’ll undertake an industry, design or research project and gain the skills and knowledge to practice as a professional engineer.\nAs a Master of Mechanical Engineering student, you can pursue your career goals and interests through one of four specialisations, or you can choose not to specialise if you’d prefer.\nDevelop advanced skills in fluid mechanics, propulsion, aeroelasticity and aerospace control, and take part in cutting edge research in world-class facilities like the Walter Bassett Aerodynamics laboratory.\nStudy tailored business subjects developed in partnership with the Melbourne Business School, covering how economics, marketing and finance relate to engineering.\nStudy the design and manufacture of machine elements, including concurrent design of systems and productions, computer-based manufacturing, automation and IT, and materials selection.\nGain expertise in advanced material processing, metals for additive manufacturing, material modelling and characterisation, and how to make high performance materials.\nLearn more about FEIT specialisations\nBuild your skills and work experience through our academically credited Internship subject. Run over 10–15 weeks, you could intern at an infrastructure and construction, aerostructures, biotechnology, manufacturing, or mining and resources company.\nWork on a real-world innovation challenge with an industry mentor through our Creating Innovative Engineering subject.\nConduct research alongside our world-leading mechanical engineering researchers in our Mechanical Engineering Capstone Project. Work on an industry partnered project, or pursue your own exploratory research. You’ll have the opportunity to present the findings to the public at our annual engineering showcase, the Endeavour Engineering and IT Exhibition.\nMaster of Mechanical Engineering\nView some sample course plans to help you select subjects that will meet the requirements for this coursework.\nExplore the subjects you could choose as part of this degree.\nContact-support \n    How can we help?\n• Arrow-right  \n          #8\n         \n          in graduate employability worldwide\n• Arrow-right  \n          #19\n         \n          university in the world\n• Course code:\n         MC-MECHENG\n[GRID_TABLE]\nArrow-right  \n        How to apply\nArrow-right  \n        Enquire\nArrow-right  \n        Register for updates\n[CARD]\nArrow-right  \n        Register for updates\n[CARD]\nArrow-right  \n        How to apply\n[CARD]\nArrow-right  \n        Enquire",

This applies even if you're studying abroad or have dual Australian citizenship.\nEntry points offer varying study durations and admission criteria based on the relevance of your prior studies.\nMeeting the published entry requirements for this course does not guarantee selection.\nWhere our admission criteria includes a minimum Weighted Average Mark (WAM) and/or specific subject criteria, these are based on University of Melbourne grades and subjects. If you've studied elsewhere, we'll assess your relevant prior studies and equivalent grades. Your final WAM may be adjusted depending on your previous institution's accreditation, subject grading, and pass marks.\nYou may have the option to enrol in specific single subjects through the University's Community Access Program, even if you are not enrolled in a course. Completing these prerequisite subjects may qualify you for entry into this course. This option is not available to student visa holders or applicants. Learn more about single subject study.\nYou can use our graduate coursework grade conversion eligibility calculator to get an indication of whether you are eligible for this course based on your previous studies and Weighted Average Mark (WAM).\nAll applicants to the University of Melbourne must satisfy the English language requirements. This may be achieved in a number of ways, including recognised previous study taught and assessed entirely in English or an approved English language test. If you are from a non-English speaking background, the required standard of English for this degree is one of the following English proficiency test scores:\nIf you need to undertake an English language test, you must meet one of the scores* below:\nWhen assessing applications, the Selection Committee will consider your previous studies and academic performance.\nThe Selection Committee may request additional information to clarify any aspect of an application, according to the University’s Academic Board rules regarding selection instruments.\nIf you don’t meet the prerequisite subject requirements, make an enquiry to determine which subjects you should enrol in.\nWe encourage domestic students to explore eligibility for Graduate Access Melbourne (GAM). GAM offers an opportunity for admission to this course even if your tertiary marks are below the standard entry requirements. GAM applicants may also be considered for financial bursaries and Commonwealth Supported Places (CSPs) where available.\nGAM categories include coming from a rural area, being an Indigenous Australian, experiencing financial hardship or personal difficulties, having refugee status, or living with a disability or medical condition. In assessing applications, we look to balance opportunity and your capacity to succeed.\nPrior studies may be credited towards your degree and potentially reduce the duration of your course. This is known as Advanced Standing (also known as credit or recognition of prior learning).\nIf you are coming from another institution, you may be eligible to receive credit for up to one year and enter the 2-year course. Exact credit can only be determined on application.\nIn order for credit to be assessed, students who have graduated from an institution other than the University of Melbourne must supply an official syllabus or subject description of all technical subjects studied at their previous institution of study.\nEnsure your syllabus contains as much detail as possible. Applications for additional credit will not be considered unless there has been a major change to your transcript.\nDownload a syllabus template\nContact-support \n    How can we help?\n• Arrow-right  \n          #8\n         \n          in graduate employability worldwide\n• Arrow-right  \n          #19\n         \n          university in the world\n• Course code:\n         MC-MECHENG\n• English language test score requirements\n              Chevron-down\n• If you need to undertake an English language test, you must meet one of the scores* below:\n               \n    IELTS\n   \n    6.5\n   \n  with no band less than 6.0\n    TOEFL\n   \n    79+\n   \n  with writing 21; speaking 18; reading 13; listening 13\n    PEARSON\n   \n    64+\n   \n  with no communicative skill below 60\n    CAMBRIDGE\n   \n    176+\n   \n  with no skill less than 169 \n                *Accepted tests: IELTS (Academic English Only); TOEFL Internet-based test; Pearson Test of English Academic; Cambridge English: Advanced/Certificate of Advanced English (CAE).
