      "content": "Overview of the Degree:\nThe Master of Engineering degree (MEng) in Advanced Manufacturing and Design within the MIT Department of Mechanical Ebgineering combines in-depth, group-based graduate subjects and a project-based thesis experience at leading companies to accelerate students’ engineering and leadership skills. The program provides a Launchpad for graduates to become innovative future leaders in established manufacturing firms and new entrepreneurial ventures. This approach leads to what our alumni has termed “compressed” or “formalized” experience, and gives our graduates a blend of theory and practice in that uniquely prepares them for this most demanding field.\nThe curriculum includes subjects in manufacturing processes and process control, factory systems and supply chains, business fundamentals and the product development process.  Several subjects include hands-on labs and most of which have significant project components.  Outside of the formal classroom there are numerous activities including interactions with industry leaders, manufacturing entrepreneurs, and thought leaders.  Finally, there is an 8-month long “Group Project in Industry”, where as part of a team, each student works with a local manufacturing company on a problem of immediate value to the company, and that will also lead to the MEng thesis.\nThis synergistic combination of MIT’s eminent-engineering curriculum with pragmatic time in industry enables you to graduate in just 12 months fully prepared to be both an effective and innovative leader in the field.\nFor students who prefer online learning, a blended online/onsite degree path allows for a Principles of Manufacturing MicroMasters credential to be redeemed for course credit. The MicroMasters PoM online credential may be redeemed for 48 academic units (equivalent to 1/3 of the typical degree program.) The credential requires learners to successfully pass 8 verified online courses and 4 final exams. After the credential is earned, you may apply to the MEng degree program and if accepted, redeem the PoM courses as credit. This blend of online and onsite learning allows you to begin learning online at your own pace and spend only 8 months on campus to complete your degree.\nFor more information about the MicroMasters Principles of Manufacturing Program, please visit https://micromasters.mit.edu/pom/\nGraduates have already moved into a variety of careers in manufacturing that range from semiconductor process engineering, new product introduction, and factory management to supply chain design and implementation.

During the Spring semester students start meeting with with the company and their thesis advisor to identity the problem or opportunity to pursue, the project scope and expected deliverables. These meeting are usually weekly in-persoon or through video calls. Then in the summer, starting in mid-May and goiung through mid-August students work on the company project full time. These projects – done in groups of three students per site – form the basis of the thesis portion of the degree. Students work on-site under the supervision of an MIT faculty member typically solving near-term problems for their company.\nA number of companies propose the projects in late fall and a selection process matches students with their project and MIT faculty advisors. Students begin their initial work at each company site in January followed by once-weekly meetings during the spring semester. From late May until mid-August the groups work on-site full-time to complete their projects. Students document his or her full contribution to the project thesis, which is submitted to their MIT advisor for approval.\nRecent Project Examples\nSupply Chain Planning in Semiconductor ManufacturingThe team mapped out its current planning framework, including demand management, capacity planning, and material planning. After identifying the challenges faced in the current framework, the team proposed the framework for managing demand, capacity, and material planning in terms of strategic, tactical, and operational planning.\nTemplate Modeling for Control AssemblyThe final assembly of ion implantation equipment must take place in a clean room.  To reduce the time and expense of this assembly, the team developed a novel alignment system that can obviate in-plant assembly and allowed the equipment supplier to assemble on the customer site.  This greatly reduces both the time and expense of assembly and save considerable clean room capacity.\nContinuous Micro Contact PrintingIn this project the conventional printing process of flexography was combined with the soft-lithographic process of micro contact printing for resist application.  A prototype system was constructed and the basic limits of process speed and quality were explored.  Based on this work, the company can continue the path to commercialization of this novel process.\nWash Cycle Improvement in High Performance Circuit Board ProductionThis project sought to Identify root causes of flux residue presence underneath critical high performance circuit components.  It combined board architectural design-related issues and investigates alternative washing methods.  It then recommended a new washing strategy and equipment to greatly reduce board failures.\nImproved Back End Processing for Polymer Solar CellsThis project, which was located an a medium stage start-up company, involved modeling the manufacturing system for material resource planning and yield tracking.  It developed a scan-code based inventory tracking system and created a time study for future production need.  It also identified the existing bottlenecks and suggested changes to improve throughput, yield and reliability of the processes\nQuality Improvements for a Diagnostic Fluidic DeviceWorking with a local microfluidics start up company, this team looked at a number of issues related to scale up to mass production.  It identified opportunities for quality control improvement, and also studied certain critical processes to allow for prediction of expected behavior once at scale.\nReduce the Cycle Time in Ion Implanter ManufacturingThis team was asked to increase the capacity of a complex assembly line to responded to high demand without significant capital investment.  Through the use of value stream mapping, they eliminated non value-adding steps, reduced WIP and added an analytical system for decisions making\n[GRID_TABLE]\nIndustry Projects\n\nThe capstone of the MEng degree is group industry project in a manufacturing company.

Factory planning and scheduling topics include flow planning, bottleneck characterization, buffer and batch-size tactics, seasonal planning, and dynamic behavior of production systems.\n2.961 Management for Engineers *\nProvides an overview of management issues for graduate engineers. Topics approached in terms of career options as engineering practitioner, manager, and entrepreneur. Specific topics include semantics, finance, starting a company, and people management. Through selected readings from texts and cases, focus is on the development of individual skills and management tools. Requires student participation and discussion, term paper.\n* For the blended degree program, Fall classes are replaced by redeemed credit from the MicroMasters Principles of Manufacturing credential. Students pursuing the blended degree begin on-campus classes in the spring semester. See https://micromasters.mit.edu/pom/ for more information.\nJanuary Term (IAP)\nIn addition, in January,  students begin their Group Projects in Industry. They may also participate in other activities during this Independent Activities Period.\nSpring Term\nDuring the spring term students take three courses and a seminar (a total of 42 units), and work on their Group Projects (9 Units).\nIDS.735J Supply Chain Planning &  IDS.736[J] Manufacturing System and Supply Chain Design*\nFocuses on decision making for system design, as it arises in manufacturing systems and supply chains. Students exposed to frameworks and models for structuring the key issues and trade-offs. Presents and discusses new opportunities, issues and concepts introduced by the internet and e-commerce. Introduces various models, methods and software tools for logistics network design, capacity planning and flexibility, make-buy, and integration with product development. Industry applications and cases illustrate concepts and challenges.\nOne Design course from 2.739, 2.744 or after consulting with MEng advisor, additional mechanical engineering elective if 2.76 or other Design course was completed in the Fall as an overload.\n2.739J Product Design and Development\nCovers modern tools and methods for product design and development. The cornerstone is a project in which teams of management, engineering, and industrial design students conceive, design, and prototype a physical product. Class sessions employ cases and hands-on exercises to reinforce the key ideas. Topics include: product planning, identifying customer needs, concept generation, product architecture, industrial design, concept design, and design-for-manufacturing.\n2.744 Product Design\nProject-centered subject addressing transformation of ideas into successful products which are properly matched to the user and the market. Students are asked to take a more complete view of a new product and to gain experience with designs judged on their aesthetics, ease of use, and sensitivities to the realities of the marketplace. Lectures on modern design process, industrial design, visual communication, form-giving, mass production, marketing, and environmentally conscious design.\n2.888 Professional Seminar in Global Manufacturing and Entrepreneurship – 3 Units\nCovers a broad range of topics in modern manufacturing, from models and structures for 21st-century operations, to case studies in leadership from the shop floor to the executive office. Also includes global perspectives from Asia, Europe and North America, with guest speakers from all three regions. Explores opportunities for new ventures in manufacturing. Intended primarily for Master of Engineering in Manufacturing students.\n2.THG Graduate Thesis – 9 UnitsStudents also begin their thesis project in the spring. This thesis project continues through the summer term, when students participate in industry-based group projects. This full-time project gives students a chance to apply their understanding of manufacturing fundamentals to real problems and make real-world improvements in process, material flow and logistics.\nAdditionally, students must choose one of the electives from the following list:\n2.071 Mechanics of Solid Materials2.120 Introduction to Robotics2.372J Design and Fabrication of Microelectromechanical Systems2.391J Nanostructure Fabrication2.734 Engineering Systems Development2.753 Development of Mechanical Products2.77 FUNdaMENTALS of Precision Product Design*or other relevant Mechanical Engineering elective approved in consultation with MEng Advisor.\nSummer Term\n2.THG Graduate Thesis – 24 Units\nThe key activity of the summer term is the Group Project.  The full time work in industry and thesis project culminate in mid-August. Students receive their Degree in the mid-September and are elegible to walk in the commencement ceremony the following June.\nOverload and Cross Registration:\nMIT and the MEng program do not impose an upper credit limit taken beyond the required curriculum outlined above. Students make register any open graduate subject, or in those requring instructor or department approval, in any of the five MIT schools.  Based on our previous experience, students are encouraged to only register for the Fall reguired classes, and if desired, undertake “overload” classes in the Spring semeser. These subjects cannot be used substitute the required MEng subjects. Students will discuss these options when they meet on registration day with the MEng program office to discuss for orientation, including registration plans.\nIn the Spring semester, MEng students are eligible to “overload” by cross-registering for academic subjects offered at the Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences or one of Harvard’s professional schools, and must abide by the rules of both MIT and Harvard. Make note of key dates, by school, on the Harvard Academic Calendar. Remember that you must meet the earlier of MIT’s or Harvard’s cross-registration and add/drop/change deadlines. Cross-registered subjects will not be approved by the program office if these subjects conflict with meeting times of the required MEng curriculum.

The following are required unless similar prior classes can be demonstrated:\n2.810 Manufacturing Processes and Systems \nIntroduction to manufacturing systems and manufacturing processes including assembly, machining, injection molding, casting, thermoforming, and more. Emphasis on the relationship between physics and randomness to quality, rate, cost, and flexibility. Attention to the relationship between the process and the system, and the process and part design. Project (in small groups) requires fabrication (and some design) of a product using several different processes (as listed above).\n2.830 Control of Manufacturing Processes *\nStatistical modeling and control in manufacturing processes. Use of experimental design and response surface modeling to understand manufacturing process physics. Defect and parametric yield modeling and optimization. Forms of process control, including statistical process control, run by run and adaptive control, and real-time feedback control. Application contexts include semiconductor manufacturing, conventional metal and polymer processing, and emerging micro-nano manufacturing processes.\n2.854 Introduction to Manufacturing Systems *\nProvides ways to analyze manufacturing systems in terms of material flow and storage, information flow, capacities, and times and durations of events. Fundamental topics include probability, inventory and queuing models, forecasting, optimization, process analysis, and linear and dynamic systems. Factory planning and scheduling topics include flow planning, bottleneck characterization, buffer and batch-size tactics, seasonal planning, and dynamic behavior of production systems. \n2.961 Management for Engineers *\nProvides an overview of management issues for graduate engineers. Topics approached in terms of career options as engineering practitioner, manager, and entrepreneur. Specific topics include semantics, finance, starting a company, and people management. Through selected readings from texts and cases, focus is on the development of individual skills and management tools. Requires student participation and discussion, term paper. \n* For the blended degree program, Fall classes are replaced by redeemed credit from the MicroMasters Principles of Manufacturing credential. Students pursuing the blended degree begin on-campus classes in the spring semester. See https://micromasters.mit.edu/pom/ for more information.\nJanuary Term (IAP)\nIn addition, in January,  students begin their Group Projects in Industry. They may also participate in other activities during this Independent Activities Period.   \nSpring Term\nDuring the spring term students take three courses and a seminar (a total of 42 units), and work on their Group Projects (9 Units). \nIDS.735J Supply Chain Planning &  IDS.736[J] Manufacturing System and Supply Chain Design*\nFocuses on decision making for system design, as it arises in manufacturing systems and supply chains. Students exposed to frameworks and models for structuring the key issues and trade-offs. Presents and discusses new opportunities, issues and concepts introduced by the internet and e-commerce. Introduces various models, methods and software tools for logistics network design, capacity planning and flexibility, make-buy, and integration with product development. Industry applications and cases illustrate concepts and challenges. \nOne Design course from 2.739, 2.744 or after consulting with MEng advisor, additional mechanical engineering elective if 2.76 or other Design course was completed in the Fall as an overload. \n2.739J Product Design and Development   \nCovers modern tools and methods for product design and development. The cornerstone is a project in which teams of management, engineering, and industrial design students conceive, design, and prototype a physical product. Class sessions employ cases and hands-on exercises to reinforce the key ideas. Topics include: product planning, identifying customer needs, concept generation, product architecture, industrial design, concept design, and design-for-manufacturing.\n2.744 Product Design   \nProject-centered subject addressing transformation of ideas into successful products which are properly matched to the user and the market. Students are asked to take a more complete view of a new product and to gain experience with designs judged on their aesthetics, ease of use, and sensitivities to the realities of the marketplace. Lectures on modern design process, industrial design, visual communication, form-giving, mass production, marketing, and environmentally conscious design. \n2.888 Professional Seminar in Global Manufacturing and Entrepreneurship – 3 Units\nCovers a broad range of topics in modern manufacturing, from models and structures for 21st-century operations, to case studies in leadership from the shop floor to the executive office. Also includes global perspectives from Asia, Europe and North America, with guest speakers from all three regions. Explores opportunities for new ventures in manufacturing. Intended primarily for Master of Engineering in Manufacturing students.\n2.THG Graduate Thesis – 9 UnitsStudents also begin their thesis project in the spring. This thesis project continues through the summer term, when students participate in industry-based group projects. This full-time project gives students a chance to apply their understanding of manufacturing fundamentals to real problems and make real-world improvements in process, material flow and logistics. \nAdditionally, students must choose one of the electives from the following list: \n2.071 Mechanics of Solid Materials2.120 Introduction to Robotics2.372J Design and Fabrication of Microelectromechanical Systems2.391J Nanostructure Fabrication2.734 Engineering Systems Development2.753 Development of Mechanical Products2.77 FUNdaMENTALS of Precision Product Design*or other relevant Mechanical Engineering elective approved in consultation with MEng Advisor.\nSummer Term\n2.THG Graduate Thesis – 24 Units\nThe key activity of the summer term is the Group Project.  The full time work in industry and thesis project culminate in mid-August. Students receive their Degree in the mid-September and are elegible to walk in the commencement ceremony the following June. \nOverload and Cross Registration:\nMIT and the MEng program do not impose an upper credit limit taken beyond the required curriculum outlined above. Students make register any open graduate subject, or in those requring instructor or department approval, in any of the five MIT schools.  Based on our previous experience, students are encouraged to only register for the Fall reguired classes, and if desired, undertake “overload” classes in the Spring semeser. These subjects cannot be used substitute the required MEng subjects. Students will discuss these options when they meet on registration day with the MEng program office to discuss for orientation, including registration plans.\nIn the Spring semester, MEng students are eligible to “overload” by cross-registering for academic subjects offered at the Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences or one of Harvard’s professional schools, and must abide by the rules of both MIT and Harvard. Make note of key dates, by school, on the Harvard Academic Calendar. Remember that you must meet the earlier of MIT’s or Harvard’s cross-registration and add/drop/change deadlines.
