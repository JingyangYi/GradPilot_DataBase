This programme addresses these needs by educating a new generation of environmental scientist and engineers that can provide adequate and state-of-the-art solutions to tackle complex, multidisciplinary environmental issues. Throughout the programme, students move between the partner institutions.\nGrowing awareness of the human impact on the environment has convinced most governments of the need to prevent air, water and soil pollution. Increasingly, remediation of contaminated sites is becoming a priority target. Consequently, there is a strong and ever increasing demand for specialists trained in pollution prevention and remediation. This Joint Erasmus Mundus programme addresses these needs by educating a new generation of environmental scientist and engineers that can provide adequate and state-of-the-art environmental technology and engineering solutions to tackle complex, multidisciplinary environmental issues.\nSuccessful graduates will have acquired a comprehensive knowledge of:\nThey will be able to develop, design and apply technologies for the prevention and remediation of environmental pollution. In addition, they should be capable of:\nThe admission requirements may vary. Depending on your prior education, you can either enrol directly or there may be additional requirements.\nThe overall programme structure is outlined below:\nGeneral courses\nGeneral environmental technology course units at the introductory level provide the concepts required to specialise in later semesters. They cover environmental biotechnology and remediation technologies for soil, sludge, water, air and waste. To integrate their knowledge, students are exposed to case studies in the course \"Interdisciplinary project/Communication and writing skills for Engineers\", which they elaborate under guidance. They simultaneously are explicitly introduced to written and oral communications in Engineering. In the second year, “Research-2-Business: Environmental Engineering and Resource Recovery” exposes students to the professional fields through seminars and exercises guided by highly qualified experts from academia and industry. The course unit \"Introduction to the Circular Economy, Economics and Management of Natural Resources\" provides students with the knowledge and skills to incorporate sustainable principles into their engineering work.\nElective tracks and elective course units\nStudents have the flexibility to tailor their educational journey through a combination of elective tracks and elective course units. In the second semester, they can choose between the tracks “Ecotechnologies and Resource Recovery” and “Desalination and Water Reuse”. The third semester presents an opportunity to explore either “Environmental Engineering” or “Resource Recovery” tracks. Elective course units offer additional opportunities to tailor the program to individual interests.\nMaster's Dissertation\nCompleting the Master's dissertation is a requirement for any student who wants to obtain their Master’s degree. The Master’s dissertation is an original piece of research. Its aim is to develop and strengthen the students’ research skills. Students select a topic and receive guidance from a supervisor.\nProgramme Mobility\nOver the course of the study programme, students move between the partner institutions. They begin their academic journey at the University of Chemistry and Technology in Prague, Czech Republic before moving to UNESCO-IHE Delft in The Netherlands for the second semester. The third semester takes them to Ghent University in Gent, Belgium. The fourth and final semester is dedicated to their thesis research, which they can conduct at one of the partner institutes or collaborate with an associate partner.\nTrained graduates will be fully prepared to fill executive positions in international institutions (governments, universities, non-governmental organisations, etc.) and private companies that deal with either application and development of pollution prevention, remediation and engineering techniques or regulatory decision-making.\nAt Ghent University, we strive to educate people who dare to think about the challenges of tomorrow. For that purpose, we provide education that is embedded in six strategic objectives: Think Broadly, Keep Researching, Cultivate Talent, Contribute, Extend Horizons, Opt for Quality.\nGhent University continuously focuses on quality assurance and quality culture. The Ghent University's quality assurance system offers information on each study programme’s unique selling points, and on its strengths and weaknesses with regard to quality assurance.\nMore information:\nGhent University's Education Objectives\nQuality Assurance at Ghent University\nThis study programme is accredited by the Accreditation Organization of the Netherlands and Flanders (NVAO).

This supportive setting encourages academic excellence, personal development, and global citizenship.\n4. True joint international diploma accredited by reputable organizations. Earning a joint diploma from multiple renowned universities demonstrates the programme's comprehensiveness and quality. It holds international recognition and is highly valued by employers worldwide. Additionally, the accreditation from reputable organizations ensures that the programme adheres to rigorous standards and delivers a well-rounded education in environmental technology and engineering.\n1. A strong foundation in science and mathematics. Environmental engineers need to have a strong background in science and mathematics in order to understand and solve environmental problems. Therefore, the program does not only provide students with qualitative insights, but also with quantitative skills to effectively resolve problems.\n2. Exposure to a variety of environmental engineering topics. Environmental engineering is a broad field, and there are many different specializations that students can choose from. Our program exposes students to a variety of topics, such as water and wastewater treatment, air pollution control, solid waste management, and environmental remediation.\n3. Hands-on learning opportunities. Environmental engineering is a field that is best learned through hands-on experience. Our program provides students with opportunities to apply their knowledge in the lab, in the field, or through internships.\n4. A strong emphasis on problem-solving skills. Environmental engineers need to be able to identify problems, analyze data, and develop solutions. Our programme helps students to develop their problem-solving skills through coursework, projects, and research.\n5. Opportunities to learn about emerging technologies. The field of environmental engineering is constantly evolving, and new technologies are being developed all the time. Our program helps students to stay up-to-date on the latest technologies by providing them with opportunities to learn about them through coursework, seminars, and research.\n1. Limited attention to ethical considerations and decision-making. Environmental engineering decisions often involve ethical considerations and trade-offs between competing interests. Because of the programme’ s in-depth focus on technology and engineering , there is less focus on soft skills, including ethics, leadership, management and decision making, and less opportunity for interdisciplinary learning including social and economic aspects.\n2. Limited opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration. Environmental problems often require interdisciplinary approaches, drawing on knowledge from various fields, not only engineering and science, but also policy, and social sciences.
