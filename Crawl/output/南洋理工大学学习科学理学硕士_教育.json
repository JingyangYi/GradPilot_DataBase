The Master of Science in Science of Learning (MSL) is a distinctive interdisciplinary programme where students will acquire a strong foundation in science of learning, and learn how the latest advancements in neuroscience, cognitive science, and technologies bear on fundamental questions of education--how people learn and the tools we can use to optimise learning. Students will have excellent opportunities to design progressive learning solutions and new experiences to meet Singapore’s smart and future-ready workforce.Curious to know what our faculty and students think about our programmes? Click here to find out!\n\n\nThe programme leverages the strength of the National Institute of Education (NIE) in education research and seeks to extend and integrate evidence-informed research into practice. For more than a decade, NIE has spearheaded education research and contributed\n    to major advancements in knowledge and research to improve teaching and learning in Singapore schools and the wider education community.The Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine (LKCMedicine) has deep expertise in biological domains and cognitive neuroscience. Rich theoretical insights through cross-disciplinary integration from both the fields of education and neuroscience will foster the\n    critical scientific discussions necessary for evidence-informed science of learning in education.The students will be experienced professionals in:Early childhood, K12, Tertiary, and Adult educationHealthcare educationProfessional and staff developmentQuality assurance and regulation of educational institutions, e.g., Council for Private Education (CPE)Continuing education and training (CET)Science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) practitioners interested in education and learningGraduates will be thought leaders and innovators in learning who will make important contributions in the following ways:Critical thinkers, better informed prosumers*, and communicators of research in the fields of cognitive sciences, neuroscience, and educationActively able to integrate learning in interdisciplinary fields for effective translation into teaching and learningAble to advance a novel area of inquiry to optimise teaching and learningPossess scientific expertise to examine the effectiveness of education practice and policy and develop new understandings to realise evidence-informed learning outcomesScientifically-proficient about knowledge of advancing technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and Neuroscience modalities, cutting-edge competencies and skills to develop learning optimisationsNurture other educators to realise Singapore’s national goal of optimising and lifelong learning* Prosumers are both professionals and consumers who not only consume but also produce content\n\n\n\n\nThis programme is interdisciplinary by design and underscores the importance of scientific and evidence-based rigour to examine questions and issues at the intersection of multiple disciplines. The curriculum draws upon connections in cognitive\n        science, psychology, neuroscience, biological science, education, educational technology and computer science. Students develop interdisciplinary thinking and research analysis skills that allow for customisation based on the individual’s\n        academic and professional goals. An important and critical value-added component of this programme is the synergistic partnership between the National Institute of Education (NIE), with its recognised capacity and expertise to impact educational research and\n        practice, and the Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine (LKCMedicine), with deep expertise in biological domains and cognitive neuroscience. Theoretical insights from both the education and neuroscience fields will foster the\n        critical scientific discussions necessary for evidence-informed Science of Learning (SoL) education enriched by cross-disciplinary integration.With shifts in economic focus and the growing relevance of lifelong learning, the programme offers an alternative pathway for professionals who seek graduate micro-credentials through modular courses that are stackable towards\n        the FlexiMasters in Mind, Brain, and Education and the MSL programme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Bachelor's degree in the following areas:\n        Psychology, Education, Neuroscience, Cognitive Science, Learning Sciences, orScience- and technology-related area (e.g., Engineering, the Sciences), orMathematics or StatisticsORA Bachelor’s degree and relevant working experience, preferably in K-12 education, teacher professional development, continuing education and training or other relevant adult education.ORA relevant NTU FlexiMasters with good grades and relevant working experience, preferably in K-12 education, teacher professional development, continuing education and training or other relevant adult education.See detailed requirements for competency in English Language here.There is generally only one intake for this programme, in January.
