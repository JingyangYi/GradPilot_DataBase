      "content": "[HEADING] Curriculum at St Andrews\nThe main aims of the curriculum at the University of St Andrews are to foster flexible, independent thinkers who have both subject-related and generic skills in readiness for work or further study.\nThe curriculum portfolio is developed through research-led teaching, guided by cutting-edge researchers and delivered by outstanding teachers from around the world. Embedded in the core curriculum are principles of research methodology, ethics and responsibility, as well as insights into global and cultural issues.\nThe University teaches not only skills and flexible thinking, but a belief in the ability to use these beyond graduation.\nThe University provides an exceptional breadth and opportunity of choice, with a large range of subjects that can lead to joint degrees. You will be encouraged to try new disciplines while following your own established academic interests. The University will ensure that relevant information and advice is available when students are deciding to make such choices. To complement the key information contained in the course catalogue, academic staff are available for consultation in a process overseen by the Associate Deans, who can also provide expert guidance to students.\nIn order to achieve this, and to ensure that its teaching incorporates the research and related interests of its staff, the University reviews its curriculum portfolio on a regular basis, including programmes and modules. Changes are made with due consideration to minimising impact, safeguarding academic standards, and assuring the quality of the learning experience.\nThese may include any of the following:\nAs part of any such changes the University will:\n• Changes to the timetable, location, number of classes, and method of delivery of modules and programmes of study, provided such alterations are minimal.\n• Reasonable variations to the content and syllabus of modules and programmes of study, including in relation to placements or study abroad, to ensure that teaching is research-led, current and relevant.\n• Suspension, discontinuation or combining of modules or programmes of study, for example, because a key member of staff is unwell or leaves the University.\n• Changes to ordinances, regulations, policies and procedures which the University reasonably considers necessary, for example, in light of changes in the law or the requirements of the University's regulators, or for the benefit of its students and staff.\n• Not providing programmes of study or modules, or combining them with others, if the University reasonably considers this to be necessary, for example, because too few students are admitted to them to provide the required learning experience.\n• Endeavour to minimise impact for current students and applicants by communicating changes at the earliest opportunity, offering reasonable alternative options or cancellation with no detriment, and timing the changes sensitively.\n• Introduce major changes normally in such a way that these come into force at the beginning of the following academic year (if fundamental to the programme, major changes will normally come into force with effect from the next cohort of students).\n• Apply changes to policies, regulations and procedures with no detriment to current students.\n• Be cognisant of students on Leave of Absence and ensure that any changes to the curriculum are communicated clearly and that suitable pathway options are available on return to study.\n• Ensure that the portfolio of modules available for students delivers the published learning aims and outcomes of the programme for which students are enrolled.",

From counterfeit products to illegal online markets, these hidden threats undermine legitimate business operations and pose difficult questions for risk management.\nThis talk will explore real-world examples, such as Intel Corporation's battle against rampant product counterfeiting and alteration in the 1990s and 2000s. Intel faced a thriving grey market for overclocked microprocessors – devices modified to falsely appear as higher-performing models and sold at discounts that undercut the legal market. Traditional solutions, such as enforcement and working with local governments, failed to resolve the issue. Instead, Intel and other technology companies turned to technological innovations that rendered such counterfeiting obsolete.\nThe discussion will then examine modern-day challenges like illegal online betting and gambling markets – borderless operations beyond the reach of regulators that generate massive profits for organised crime while undermining legal businesses and causing social harm.\nJoin us for another informative MX talk and explore how companies can tackle these hidden risks and protect their operations in an increasingly interconnected world.\nDr David Woodcock, Vice President - Research and Analytics, WNS Global Services\nAs the world of work becomes ever more complex, data and analytics can help support informed decision making.

What differentiates those that survive and grow from those that don't? In this talk, Dave Pennino, CEO and founder of LogicSource, will share his journey of building a $500MM market cap business from a simple idea initially captured in just 16 PowerPoint slides. Today, his company, which includes a retained professional services (BPO) business, a 5-module SaaS platform, and a data business, employs over 400 people and continues to grow.

From counterfeit products to illegal online markets, these hidden threats undermine legitimate business operations and pose difficult questions for risk management.\nThis talk will explore real-world examples, such as Intel Corporation's battle against rampant product counterfeiting and alteration in the 1990s and 2000s. Intel faced a thriving grey market for overclocked microprocessors – devices modified to falsely appear as higher-performing models and sold at discounts that undercut the legal market. Traditional solutions, such as enforcement and working with local governments, failed to resolve the issue. Instead, Intel and other technology companies turned to technological innovations that rendered such counterfeiting obsolete.\nThe discussion will then examine modern-day challenges like illegal online betting and gambling markets – borderless operations beyond the reach of regulators that generate massive profits for organised crime while undermining legal businesses and causing social harm.\nJoin us for another informative MX talk and explore how companies can tackle these hidden risks and protect their operations in an increasingly interconnected world.\n\n\n\n\nWeek 2 –  Using data and analytics to make an impact\n\nWednesday 5 February 2025\n\n\nDr David Woodcock, Vice President - Research and Analytics, WNS Global Services\nAs the world of work becomes ever more complex, data and analytics can help support informed decision making.

He leads sales operations and enablement bringing data and research to support growth.\nHe studied with us here in St Andrews as both an undergraduate and postgraduate. The work from his Chemistry PhD achieved 10 academic papers and has been cited more than 700 times to date.\nThrough his career he has worked in a variety of research, analytics and data leadership roles in manufacturing, consulting and financial services.\n\n\n\n\nWeek 3 –  From scratch: lawsuits, loans and late nights\n\nWednesday 12 February 2025\n\n\nDavid Pennino, Founder and Chief Executive Officer, LogicSource\nMost startups fail, and even brilliant ideas often don't make it. What differentiates those that survive and grow from those that don't? In this talk, Dave Pennino, CEO and founder of LogicSource, will share his journey of building a $500MM market cap business from a simple idea initially captured in just 16 PowerPoint slides. Today, his company, which includes a retained professional services (BPO) business, a 5-module SaaS platform, and a data business, employs over 400 people and continues to grow.

He will share the personal lessons and principles that have guided his decision-making throughout this journey, offering insights on resilience, strategic thinking, and the mindset needed to navigate the complexities of building a successful business. This talk will provide valuable takeaways for anyone considering entrepreneurship, helping them understand what it truly takes to survive and thrive in the startup world.\nDave has over 20 years’ experience in the services and outsourcing industry, including roles as a senior executive at Williams Lea Group, Scient, and Gartner.

From counterfeit products to illegal online markets, these hidden threats undermine legitimate business operations and pose difficult questions for risk management.\nThis talk will explore real-world examples, such as Intel Corporation's battle against rampant product counterfeiting and alteration in the 1990s and 2000s. Intel faced a thriving grey market for overclocked microprocessors – devices modified to falsely appear as higher-performing models and sold at discounts that undercut the legal market. Traditional solutions, such as enforcement and working with local governments, failed to resolve the issue. Instead, Intel and other technology companies turned to technological innovations that rendered such counterfeiting obsolete.\nThe discussion will then examine modern-day challenges like illegal online betting and gambling markets – borderless operations beyond the reach of regulators that generate massive profits for organised crime while undermining legal businesses and causing social harm.\nJoin us for another informative MX talk and explore how companies can tackle these hidden risks and protect their operations in an increasingly interconnected world.\nWeek 1 –  Managing business risk from illicit markets and organised crime\n\nWednesday 29 January 2025\nWeek 1 –  Managing business risk from illicit markets and organised crime\nWeek 1 –  Managing business risk from illicit markets and organised crime\nWednesday 29 January 2025\nMartin Purbrick, Consultant, Analyst, Writer Director, Purbrick & Associates\nIllicit markets and organised crime pose significant challenges to businesses, extending beyond predictable operational risks and often posing strategic, financial and reputational risks.

When the difference between such success and failure can be so pivotal to the commercial success of a company, knowing and acting on the answers to this question can hardly be of more fundamental importance to entrepreneurs, investors, senior management, and indeed any stakeholder of an organisation. Shure has been making microphones for almost 100 years and is said to be the preferred brand for musicians and sound professionals at the top of their game. In this talk, Milne will explain why innovative products and services can only come from companies who have deep empathy with their customers and understand how to nurture and manage innovation as a commercial process at the beating heart of their business.\nWeek 4 –  Getting the right product or service to the market – a matter of some importance!\n\nWednesday 9 October 2024\n4pm\nIn person\nWeek 4 –  Getting the right product or service to the market – a matter of some importance!\nWeek 4 –  Getting the right product or service to the market – a matter of some importance!\nWednesday 9 October 2024\nIn person\nBarclay Milne, Director Of Engineering at Shure\nWhy do some companies consistently provide great products or services to their customers, almost as if it’s in their DNA, while others - despite employing very talented people - fail to hit the target?

It has a distinctive and proud identity as a smaller school focused on research and teaching of the highest quality.\nThe Department is research intensive, and is underpinned by a strong grounding in the social sciences. At postgraduate level, students can benefit from internationally recognised research expertise, as acknowledged in the Research Excellence Framework (REF), while still enjoying the benefits of a small and friendly institution.\nThe Department of Management offers the following research degrees:\nFind out more about research in the Department.\nApplicants for research degrees in the School of Management are required to choose a potential supervisor before applying.\nFirst, you will need to choose a research group relevant to your area of interest. To decide which research area within the School is for you, look for more information in the web pages about the School's research groups. If you cannot find your particular area of interest within the thematic research groups, it is unlikely that the School could provide you with supervision.\nHaving identified your research group, you need to identify a potential supervisor. Each group's web page has a list of academic and research members that links to more information about each person. You can also check the main list of academics on the School's People page which shows research keywords for staff.\nContact a prospective supervisor by sending them your research proposal, which should be no longer than 1,500 words excluding references, and your CV. They will expect you to have a research background in your chosen field.\nThen, after you have agreement from a prospective supervisor, you should complete the online application, as indicated in the 'How to apply' section below.\nResearch students within the School are funded from a wide range of sources including UK research councils, charities, industry partners and overseas agencies. This section and the Scholarships page provide information about current postgraduate funding opportunities.\nYour tuition fees will depend on your fee status and the degree you are applying for. In addition to tuition fees, you will need to cover the cost of your accommodation and everyday living, including food, travel and laundry. You should also set aside an allowance for books, equipment, field trips and other fees.\nYour offer of a place for postgraduate study does not guarantee financial support. However, the University of St Andrews has many postgraduate scholarships that you can apply for, alongside the other funding sources listed here and at Scholarships.\nAfter submitting your study application, you may apply for any available awards separately through the scholarships and funding catalogue found at Scholarships. Within the catalogue, closing dates and eligibility are listed separately for named individual awards. Prospective research students can apply for most awards without first holding a study offer.\nIf you are a new applicant to the University of St Andrews, you will receive a unique link directly to the scholarships and funding catalogue.\nIf you are a current student at St Andrews, you can access scholarships and funding through 'My Applications' on MySaint.\nWhen new competitive PhD studentships are offered by the School, details will be posted here.\nThe School of Management is a member of the ESRC's Scottish Graduate School of Social Science (SGSSS) doctoral training centre. ESRC SGSSS studentships and scholarships are awarded annually. The scholarship competition opens in autumn, for degrees starting the following September.\nSee Economic and Social Research Council studentship funding for eligibility and application information.\nBelow is a selection of general funding opportunities that may be relevant to research with the School of Management. You can view a longer list of general funding opportunities on the Scholarships page.\nThe School would usually expect a first class or 2.1 degree in a relevant subject and a distinction at Masters level, with a significant component of advanced study in the intended area of specialism. However, qualifications are less important than the proposed topic, the quality of the research proposal, and the identification of an appropriate supervisor.\nDoctoral students are expected to present fluently in English and to have a solid command of written academic English.\nInternational students who do not have English as their first language must have an IELTS score of 7.0 or above, with a minimum score of 6.5 in every section of the test.\nIf you have been taught solely and wholly in English for the duration of your undergraduate degree (at least three years or more), it is unlikely you will need to provide evidence of English proficiency. The selection panel considering your application will decide whether or not an IELTS or TOEFL score or language training will be required.\nIf you intend to self-fund your studies or receive funding from another source, you can apply at any time to begin studies in August, September, October, January or May.\nIf you do not intend to self-fund your studies and have a funded studentship (for example SGSSS), applications can be made throughout the year for September entry.\nAt present there is no closing date for applying to the programme. There is, however, intense academic competition for places at St Andrews, and only a limited number of spaces are available.\nAfter you have determined a potential research supervisor, as in the 'research supervisors' section above, you can start your application online. If a 'Management' option is not immediately available on the web form, please select 'Business School'.\nYou will need to complete the online application form and upload the following supporting documentation:\nA doctoral candidate in the School of Management works closely with their supervisor, while undertaking a focused programme of original research. Read about the School's current postgraduate cohort and their research interests.\nA range of research seminars, meetings and presentations provide support and encouragement throughout the period of study. At workshops and conferences, students meet with colleagues from other universities, share experiences and present their work as it develops.\nModules in the social sciences, addressing philosophy and methods, are available for Management doctoral students to audit. In recent years, these modules have considered topics including:\nIn addition to research training in the School and advanced training provided by the Scottish Graduate School of Social Science (SGSSS), doctoral students have access to the Centre for Educational Enhancement and Development (CEED). Within CEED, GRADskills is a free, comprehensive training programme supporting academic, professional, and personal development with activities and workshops.\nAt the end of the programme, students will submit a well-developed thesis for examination by experts in the appropriate field of research. This oral examination represents the culmination of the candidate's study and dedicated work. It is not uncommon for candidates, by the time of their examination, to have given papers at academic conferences or to be in the process of submitting papers for publication in peer-reviewed journals.\nRegistered MRes students are required to complete 100 credits of core social science and management modules, one 20-credit module from a list of options, and the 60-credit MN5399 MRes Dissertation in Management Studies.\nAs an example, the MRes for 2022-2023 required students to complete 100 credits from:\nIn addition, students chose one 20-credit option module from the following list of modules:\nAlso required were the full 60 credits from MN5399 MRes Dissertation in Management Studies.\nThe sum of credits would be 180.\nThe module list changes from time to time, and some modules have prerequisites. You can learn more about the individual modules via the module catalogue.\nBan examined, with reference to Bourdieu, financialisation in the unique institutional structure of the art market.\nShuting's research considered detrimental effects of inequality on self-worth, alongside marketplace support for 'fair work'.\nMuhammed presents new evidence on the impact of governance characteristics on bank policies from the perspective of stakeholders.\nMeredith considered individual runners, group identity and online exercise classes in the context of the coronavirus pandemic.\n• PhD (Doctor of Philosophy)The PhD is studied over three to four years (or six to seven years part-time). Students produce a thesis comprising no more than 80,000 words, excluding the bibliography and appendices.\n• MRes (Masters in Research)The MRes programme equips doctoral candidates with core research skills and a wide knowledge of contemporary management theories and practices. There is no direct application to this programme. The Department recommends enrolment to students on an individual basis as a first part of the PhD programme, normally when the doctoral candidate has an undergraduate degree as their highest qualification. See below for an example of the components of the MRes programme. The MRes is recognised by the ESRC's Scottish Graduate School as part of a 1+3 doctoral programme.\n• Research supervisors\n\n\nApplicants for research degrees in the School of Management are required to choose a potential supervisor before applying.\nFirst, you will need to choose a research group relevant to your area of interest. To decide which research area within the School is for you, look for more information in the web pages about the School's research groups. If you cannot find your particular area of interest within the thematic research groups, it is unlikely that the School could provide you with supervision.\nHaving identified your research group, you need to identify a potential supervisor. Each group's web page has a list of academic and research members that links to more information about each person. You can also check the main list of academics on the School's People page which shows research keywords for staff.\nContact a prospective supervisor by sending them your research proposal, which should be no longer than 1,500 words excluding references, and your CV. They will expect you to have a research background in your chosen field.\nThen, after you have agreement from a prospective supervisor, you should complete the online application, as indicated in the 'How to apply' section below.\n• Funding and fees\n\n\nResearch students within the School are funded from a wide range of sources including UK research councils, charities, industry partners and overseas agencies. This section and the Scholarships page provide information about current postgraduate funding opportunities.\nYour tuition fees will depend on your fee status and the degree you are applying for. In addition to tuition fees, you will need to cover the cost of your accommodation and everyday living, including food, travel and laundry. You should also set aside an allowance for books, equipment, field trips and other fees.\nYour offer of a place for postgraduate study does not guarantee financial support. However, the University of St Andrews has many postgraduate scholarships that you can apply for, alongside the other funding sources listed here and at Scholarships.\nAfter submitting your study application, you may apply for any available awards separately through the scholarships and funding catalogue found at Scholarships. Within the catalogue, closing dates and eligibility are listed separately for named individual awards. Prospective research students can apply for most awards without first holding a study offer.\nIf you are a new applicant to the University of St Andrews, you will receive a unique link directly to the scholarships and funding catalogue.\nIf you are a current student at St Andrews, you can access scholarships and funding through 'My Applications' on MySaint.\nSchool of Management funding opportunities\nWhen new competitive PhD studentships are offered by the School, details will be posted here.\n\nESRC Scottish Graduate School doctoral studentships\nThe School of Management is a member of the ESRC's Scottish Graduate School of Social Science (SGSSS) doctoral training centre. ESRC SGSSS studentships and scholarships are awarded annually. The scholarship competition opens in autumn, for degrees starting the following September.\nSee Economic and Social Research Council studentship funding for eligibility and application information.\nUniversity funding opportunities for prospective students\nBelow is a selection of general funding opportunities that may be relevant to research with the School of Management.

It has a distinctive and proud identity as a smaller school focused on research and teaching of the highest quality.\nThe Department is research intensive, and is underpinned by a strong grounding in the social sciences. At postgraduate level, students can benefit from internationally recognised research expertise, as acknowledged in the Research Excellence Framework (REF), while still enjoying the benefits of a small and friendly institution.\nThe Department of Management offers the following research degrees:\n\nPhD (Doctor of Philosophy)The PhD is studied over three to four years (or six to seven years part-time). Students produce a thesis comprising no more than 80,000 words, excluding the bibliography and appendices.\nMRes (Masters in Research)The MRes programme equips doctoral candidates with core research skills and a wide knowledge of contemporary management theories and practices. There is no direct application to this programme. The Department recommends enrolment to students on an individual basis as a first part of the PhD programme, normally when the doctoral candidate has an undergraduate degree as their highest qualification. See below for an example of the components of the MRes programme. The MRes is recognised by the ESRC's Scottish Graduate School as part of a 1+3 doctoral programme.\n\nFind out more about research in the Department.\n \nOpen all\n\n\n\n\nResearch supervisors\n\n\nApplicants for research degrees in the School of Management are required to choose a potential supervisor before applying.\nFirst, you will need to choose a research group relevant to your area of interest.
