This means that applications will close once the programme is full.\nThere is no fixed deadline. However, if you’d like to be considered for any funding opportunities, you must submit your application (and all supporting documents) by the funding deadline. See the fees and funding section below for more details.\nThe\ntable of fees shows the latest tuition fees for all programmes.\nYou're charged a fee for your programme.

It doesn't cover living costs or travel or fieldwork.\nHome student fee (2025/26)\nFor this programme, all students pay the same tuition fees, regardless of their fee status.\nTo secure a place on the programme offer holders will be required to pay a deposit of 10% of the tuition fee within six weeks of receiving their offer.\nOverseas student fee (2025/26)\nAt LSE, your tuition fees, and eligibility for any financial support, will depend on whether you’re classified as a home or overseas student (known as your fee status).

Most delays and confusion are caused when applicants do not follow our instructions.\nYou must apply early, as competition for programmes at LSE is intense. Your application will not be considered until we have received all your supporting documents. Wherever possible you should submit all of your documents with your online application. You should expect to wait an average of 8 weeks for a decision when applying for a taught programme; decisions for a research programme may take longer than this.\nImportant:  LSE expects all applicants to complete their application materials without the use of paid agents or other paid professional assistance. The use of such services may lead to the rejection of application materials, the revocation of an admissions offer, cancellation of admission, or involuntary withdrawal from the University.\nUnscrupulous agents have been known to charge large sums to applicants, and then to submit fraudulent transcripts and references. They have refused to allow applicants access to their own records on our Graduate Applicant Portal Applicants have been left unable to attend LSE and having to sue the agent for financial redress. Agents who claim to 'guarantee' entry to LSE are lying. All applications are considered on their own merits and all applicants can and should submit their own information.\nNOTICE: Please be aware of an issue that has come to our attention regarding email junk/spam filters. Some email software is filtering LSE emails to the spam/junk or ‘Deleted Items/Bin’ folder so please make sure to check there for important information regarding your application. If you do find any of our emails in any of these folders, please make sure to add the domain @lse.ac.uk to your ‘Safe Senders’ or ‘Never Block’ list. Emails will be sent to you automatically from our database system once you have begun your online application and as your application progresses through each step in the process (application created; application submitted; application downloaded for processing). We will then send you a further email each time there is an update to the status of your application, including any requests for further information and the programme selectors’ decision on your application. It is essential that you ensure you can successfully receive our emails as soon as you begin your application.\nYou will need to create an account in the online application system using your email address. You should use the same email address for your application and any enquiries to us. You do not need to complete the online application form at one sitting; you can return to your partially completed application by logging back into the system using the email address and password you create at the start of the process.\nYou may submit an application via the online application system only ONCE within the application cycle (October 2024 to September 2025), so before submitting your application you should ensure that you have included all of the information you would like the selectors to review. Any further changes after your application has been submitted must be requested via the Graduate Applicant Portal and will be subject to our current processing times.\nYou must upload all of your supporting documents and nominate two referees via the online application system. The online application allows you to submit your complete application securely and quickly. Your submitted application will not be processed and considered until we have received all the required supporting documents, including a reference from each of the referees you nominate on your online application.\nIf you encounter any technical issues while completing your application, please use the “technical support” link located in the bottom-left corner of the application portal to contact us. If you begin a further new application you will not be able to transfer any information, documents, or references between them.\nWhen completing your initial online application, you may choose up to two programmes in order of preference. If you are applying for two programmes, please submit a separate statement of academic purpose for each programme. Your choices will be considered in sequence, and it is only possible to hold one offer of a place, so if you are offered a place on your first-choice programme you will not be considered for your second-choice unless you specifically request it. If you receive an offer on your first choice, and wish us to send your second choice to be considered too, please use the Add/Amend programmes form on the Graduate Applicant Portal, selecting your current second choice programme as the programme you wish to be considered for.\nIf you are unsuccessful in your application to both of your initially chosen programmes and you wish to be considered for further, additional choices, you may do this by submitting the Add/Amend programmes via the Graduate Applicant Portal and paying an additional administrative fee of £105. You should not use this form to add choices 3 and 4 before receiving a decision on each of your original programme choices, unless you wish to withdraw your initial programme choices.\nPlease note that changing your programme choices after you have submitted your online application may cause significant delays to your application being considered.\nYou are not permitted to submit an application using the online application system more than ONCE in the same admissions cycle. If you submit a second online application within the same admissions cycle, it will not be considered. To apply to further programmes after you have submitted your initial online application, you must use the process above.\nAll applications must be accompanied by supporting documents. Some of these are required by all applicants, others are only needed for specific programmes. Details of specific requirements are given on the programme pages.\nPlease consult our guide to supporting documents for full information about what you will need.\nPlease do not send supporting documents directly to departments as this will delay your application.\nPlease remember that it is your responsibility to ensure that your application is complete, including both references, your statement of academic purpose and CV, your transcript(s), the application assessment fee, and, where applicable, GRE/GMAT scores, your research proposal and/or your sample of written work.\nLSE has developed a number of programmes which are administered jointly with other institutions such as Peking University in China and University of Southern California in the USA.

The table of fees shows the latest tuition amounts for all programmes offered by the School.\nIn some cases the amount of tuition fees you will need to pay, and any financial support you are eligible for, will depend on whether you are classified as a Home or Overseas student, otherwise known as your fee status.\nLSE assesses your fee status based on guidelines provided by the Department of Education.\nFurther information about fee status classification.\nFee reductions\nStudents who completed undergraduate study at LSE and are beginning taught graduate study at the School are eligible for a fee reduction of 10 per cent of the fee. Some programmes, such as executive programmes, are excluded from this fee reduction.\nFurther information\nAlumni discountFees and Student FinanceLSE Student Fees Policy\nWe broadly estimate that you should allow about £1,300-£1,500 per month for all living expenses, including accommodation, travel, food, laundry, study costs, and other personal expenses. This will vary depending on your lifestyle and requirements, so it's important you do your own research.\nPlease note that if you will be applying for a visa, you will have to provide evidence of sufficient funds, and these amounts may vary.\nMore details on living costs and making a budget.\nGraduate Support Scheme\nLSE Master's Awards\nDonor-funded awards for Home fee status students\nProgramme-related funding\nAnniversary Scholarships\nLSE Access to Education Graduate Scholarship\nCountry based awards\nThe School makes available scholarships for students from specific regions of the world:\nCountry-based awards for taught master's students: A - C\nCountry-based awards for taught master's students: D - K\nCountry-based awards for taught master's students: L - Q\nCountry-based awards for taught master's students: R - Z\nHow to apply\nSee Applying for an LSE scholarship\nFor 2025 entry, LSE will be offering studentships to new PhD students in the form of LSE PhD Studentships, LSE ESRC Studentships and LAHP AHRC Studentships.\nThese awards are open to high calibre students of all nationalities studying across all research areas at the School.\nLSE PhD Studentships\nLSE PhD Studentships are tenable for four years and cover full fees and an annual stipend. They are available for UK, EU and international students undertaking research in any LSE discipline, with annual renewal subject to satisfactory academic performance.\nThese awards will be made solely on the basis of outstanding academic merit and research potential. This relates both to your past academic record and to an assessment of your likely aptitude to complete a PhD in your chosen topic in the time allocated.\nESRC funding\nLSE has an Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) Doctoral Training Partnership (DTP) and has ESRC studentships in a number of programmes across 19 departments. These studentships are available for students of all nationalities.\nThe structure and duration of the studentship offered will depend on a candidate's previous academic experience, and social research training & experience. ESRC studentships are applicable to both full-time and part-time study. We can discuss part-time options with you if you are interested in applying. They cover full fees (for international students, LSE will cover the difference between UK and overseas fees) and an annual stipend.\nIndividual programme entries detail which programme are eligible for ESRC funding.\nAHRC funding\nLSE is part of LAHP (London Arts and Humanities Partnership), which is funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council. Students of all nationalities can apply for one of these studentships.\nStudentships are tenable for three years and they cover full fees (for international students, LSE will cover the difference between UK and overseas fees) and an annual stipend. UKRI expects all projects to be designed in a way that enables students to submit within their funded period.\nLSE Departments that typically host AHRC studentships are International History, Media and Communications, Philosophy and Law, but students from other disciplines (for example, Anthropology, Gender Studies and International Development), can also apply if their research falls within the remit of AHRC, as explained here.\nLSE CSC Scholarship\nLSE is proud to partner with the China Scholarship Council (CSC) to offer the LSE-CSC Scholarship. This prestigious scholarship supports outstanding students from China in pursuing their research degree at LSE.\nLSE is pleased to offer up to eight scholarships each academic year. These scholarships are tenable for up to four years and recipients must be enrolled in a full time study mode.\nDepartment-specific funding\nCheck the programme-related funding page for PhD funding opportunities.\nHow to apply\nExcept for LAHP studentships (see below), academic departments nominate students for the funding opportunity they may be eligible for.

UKRI expects all projects to be designed in a way that enables students to submit within their funded period. \nLSE Departments that typically host AHRC studentships are International History, Media and Communications, Philosophy and Law, but students from other disciplines (for example, Anthropology, Gender Studies and International Development), can also apply if their research falls within the remit of AHRC, as explained here.\nLSE CSC Scholarship\nLSE is proud to partner with the China Scholarship Council (CSC) to offer the LSE-CSC Scholarship. This prestigious scholarship supports outstanding students from China in pursuing their research degree at LSE. \nLSE is pleased to offer up to eight scholarships each academic year.

Please apply as early as possible to avoid disappointment.\n[CARD]\nApplications for all Master's programmes in the Department of Management are considered on a rolling basis, so there is no application deadline/closing date. However programmes can begin to close from March onwards, so please apply as early as possible to avoid disappointment.\nYou can check the current status of a programmes on the available programmes page.\n[CARD]\nPlease visit the LSE Graduate Admissions Office website for full details of the supporting documents you will need to submit with your application.Please also check the  Admissions web page for your chosen programme for details of any programme-specific requirements (visit our index of MSc programmes web page > click on your programme > select the ‘Admissions’ tab).\n[CARD]\nPlease visit the LSE Graduate Admissions Office website to check the status of your application.Please be aware that your LSE application tracker is updated live with our systems so any decision will be displayed on there as soon as it’s processed. You will also receive email confirmation of the decision the same day.\n(All applications are dealt with centrally by the LSE Graduate Admissions Office, and the Department of Management is not involved in the processing of applications, so unfortunately we cannot answer any further questions on this).\n[CARD]\nPlease visit our English langauge requirements page to see wether you meet the language requirements for study.\n[CARD]\nNo, we do not accept external transfers into our programmes.\n[CARD]\nAll of our MSc programmes have varying entry requirements (university grades and academic background, work experience, GRE/GMAT test, English language requirement, etc.), so please visit your respective programme page for specific requirements,\n[CARD]\nPlease visit the LSE Graduate Admissions Office website for full details on international entry requirements.\n[CARD]\nAll applications are considered on their merits. Our selectors consider not only the marks on your transcript but also the academic references, personal statement and any additional GRE/GMAT test scores where relevant. If there are extenuating circumstances to your grades, please make sure that your referee(s) mention them in their letters. Your application will be strengthened if your GRE/GMAT scores (if required by your chosen programme) are high. Please bear in mind, however, that competition for places is high, and therefore if your grades are lower than the general requirements, this may consequently mean you are less likely to be offered a place.\n[CARD]\nThere is no specific or average GRE/GMAT test score required for our MSc programmes – instead we will review your test score relative to other applicants for the programme, and also in the context of all test scores submitted worldwide in the current year. Therefore we simply recommend that you aim to achieve the highest possible score in order to strengthen your application.\nPlease also note that GRE/GMAT test scores are just one part of your application, and when making a decision on your application we will consider all parts of your application as a whole (including university grades, personal statement, references, etc.).\n[CARD]\nNo, there are no other exemptions aside from those mentioned on the programme pages.\n[CARD]\nUnfortunately, where GRE/GMAT is a requirement for the programme it is not possible to submit your application without the scores. The scores must be inputted into the form before you can submit and then be considered. We would advise that you complete the rest of the form, then enter your scores in once they are received so that you can submit straight after they are received.\n[CARD]\nPlease see our Study page for the full list of programmes we offer.\n[CARD]\nYes, we offer an Executive MBA programme.

      "content": "[HEADING] MY405      Half UnitResearch Design for Policy and Programme Evaluation\nThis information is for the 2024/25 session.\nTeacher responsible\nProfessor Flora Cornish\nAvailability\nThis course is available on the MPhil/PhD in Health Policy and Health Economics, MSc in Applied Social Data Science, MSc in Gender, Policy and Inequalities, MSc in Global Health Policy, MSc in Health and International Development, MSc in Human Geography and Urban Studies (Research), MSc in Marketing and MSc in Social Research Methods. This course is available as an outside option to students on other programmes where regulations permit.\nThis course is not controlled access. If you register for a place, you are likely to be given a place.\nCourse content\nThis course teaches the fundamentals of contemporary evaluation research design, for students interested in pragmatic applications of evaluation methods in real-world settings. Students will be equipped with research design skills to be able to design and critically appraise evaluation research in applied fields such as international development, health, and public policy. Students are taught to develop a clear and coherent Theory of Change as a foundation for an evaluation. Taking a mixed methods approach, the course covers the major quantitative designs, including randomized experiments and observational (i.e. non-randomized) research designs such as instrumental variables, difference-in-differences, regression discontinuity design, matching, and synthetic control. It covers qualitative and participatory research designs and their contribution to formative research, process evaluation, realist evaluation, and theory-based evaluations. Examples from the fields of health, international development and public policy will be used throughout the lectures and seminars. Students learn to apply what they have learned, by working in groups on real research design tasks in seminars. The realities of designing evaluations for government and non-government organisations mean that resources are limited and ideal conditions are rarely met. The course therefore focuses on how to make pragmatic choices and deal with often sub-optimal tradeoffs in real-world contexts.This course focuses primarily on the fundamental principles of evaluation design rather than the implementation of particular quantitative or qualitative methodologies, there are therefore no prerequisites required to register. It is complementary with most other quantitative and qualitative courses offered by the Department of Methodology. Given some overlaps in content on the quantitative side, it is usually advised not to take this course together with MY457 Causal Inference for Observational and Experimental Studies.\nThis course is delivered through a combination of seminars and lectures totalling a minimum of 25 hours across Winter Term.This course has a reading week in Week 6 of Winter Term.\nFormative coursework\nA Theory of Change in the Winter Term.\nIndicative reading\nAngrist, J.
