It provides entry to a wide range of degree subjects for learners from some under-represented groups in higher education (check Eligibility), who need a year 0 course in order to be prepared for undergraduate studies.\nFoundation Programme courses are fully integrated elements of Durham University degree programmes and students are full members of the university. This means they become members of a college and enjoy full access to the extensive extracurricular opportunities within the university right from day one.\nStudents who successfully reach the progression standard by the end of the foundation year automatically gain entry to year one of their registered degree course without the need for a further UCAS application.\nThe majority of our students are from non-traditional university backgrounds. Many are from the North East of England, though all regions of the UK are usually represented. Foundation Programme staff are experts at teaching foundation level courses and are engaged in a wide range of scholarship activities, adding to the body of knowledge within their respective discipline areas and in the field of learning and teaching.\nThere are many types of foundation year. At Durham, the foundation year is a 'year 0' element of an undergraduate degree programme that is designed for students from some under-represented groups in higher education, who have the potential to achieve the standard for admission to Durham, but who, as a result of educational disadvantage or disruption, do not have the level of attainment or access to qualifications required for entry to a Durham University course.\nAll Foundation Programmes are delivered by a dedicated team of academic tutors from Durham’s Centre for Academic Development (DCAD). Each year the Programmes provide places for around 100 students and supports them to progress to Level 1 study in 33 academic subjects from every academic department in the University. Foundation students matriculate fully into the university, including becoming a member of one of the 17 colleges open to undergraduate students.\nMany degree courses are available 'with foundation'. Discover if the subject you wish to study has a foundation year by searching the University’s course database. This will enable you to see if your chosen degree subject is available with a foundation year.

You can find more about foundation programme modules here.\nFoundation Programme also organises (subject to staff availability and funding) educational field trips to Beamish, Howarth, Newcastle and Czech Republic.\nThe tuition fees for a foundation year in 2025/26 are £5760 for classroom based subjects and £9535 for non-classroom based subjects. Non-classroom based subjects include Biology, Computer Sciences, Archaeology, Geography, Sports Science, and Psychology based routes.
