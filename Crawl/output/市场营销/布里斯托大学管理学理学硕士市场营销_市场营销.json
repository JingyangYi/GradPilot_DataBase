We refer to these skill levels as ‘profiles’. The profile for your chosen course or programme is shown on the course page or programme page.\nThe tests and levels you need to achieve to meet the requirements are on each English language profile page.\nEnglish language proficiency tests should be obtained within two years of the start date of your programme or course.\nIf you are from, or have studied in, an English-speaking country, you may not need to provide additional evidence of your English language ability.\nEnglish language qualifications must be presented in English. If the qualification evidence is not in English you must provide a professional or certified translation, including the contact details for the translator or translation company.\nYou do not need to have reached the required level before you apply.\nWe will look at your academic qualifications and decide what offer we will make you. If you haven’t yet reached the required English level, we will give you a target grade to meet as part of your offer.\nIf you have the required level, you must include it in your application. You do not need to do anything else. If you are a national of an English-speaking country as defined by UK Visas and Immigration, then you may be considered to have the required level. You can find further details, including the list of these countries, in each of our English language profiles.\nIf you haven’t reached the required level for your course or programme, you will be given a target grade in your offer.\nYou will need to provide a valid English language qualification showing you have met the required target grade.\nIf you don’t have the required level, you can try one of the following:\n• Taking a pre-sessional language course offered by the University\n• Taking an IELTS Academic test\n• Taking a different course in your home country which qualifies (see the list under the profile)\n• Re-sitting the language tests in your home country to reach the required level.",
