The higher of the two calculations will be used as the basis for admission.\nRanking and English Language Proficiency: At a minimum, all applicants must meet program-specific academic/non-academic requirements, and English language requirements. Admission to most ANU programs is on a competitive basis. Therefore, meeting all admission requirements does not automatically guarantee entry.\nIn line with the University's admissions policy and strategic plan, an assessment for admission may include competitively ranking applicants on the basis of specific academic achievement, English language proficiency and diversity factors. Applicants will first be ranked on a GPA ('GPA1') that is calculated using all but the last semester (or equivalent) of the Bachelor degree used for admission purposes. If required, ranking may further be confirmed on the basis of:\nPrior to enrolment in this ANU program, all students who gain entry will have their Bachelor degree reassessed, to confirm minimum requirements were met.\nFurther information: English language admission requirements and post-admission support\nDiversity factors: As Australia’s national university, ANU is global representative of Australian research and education. ANU endeavours to recruit and maintain a diverse and deliberate student cohort representative not only of Australia, but the world. In order to achieve these outcomes, competitive ranking of applicants may be adjusted to ensure access to ANU is a reality for brilliant students from countries across the globe.\nAssessment of qualifications: Unless otherwise indicated, ANU will accept all Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF) qualifications or international equivalents that meet or exceed the published admission requirements of our programs, provided all other admission requirements are also met.\nWhere an applicant has more than one completed tertiary qualification, ANU will base assessment on the qualification that best meets the admission requirements for the program. Find out more about the Australian Qualifications Framework: www.aqf.edu.au.\nUnless otherwise indicated, where an applicant has more than one completed tertiary qualification, ANU will calculate the GPA for each qualification separately. ANU will base assessment on the best GPA of all completed tertiary qualifications of the same level or higher.\nANU uses a 7-point Grade Point Average (GPA) scale. All qualifications submitted for admission at ANU will be converted to this common scale, which will determine if an applicant meets our published admission requirements. Find out more about how a 7-point GPA is calculated for Australian universities: www.uac.edu.au/future-applicants/admission-criteria/tertiary-qualifications.\nApplication for course credit: Applicants with a Bachelor Degree or Graduate Certificate in a cognate discipline may be eligible for 24 units (one semester) of credit.\nApplicants with a Graduate Diploma or Honours in a cognate discipline may be eligible for 48 units (one year) of credit.\nFor the purposes of admission ‘cognate’ is to be defined as any of the following Fields of Education:\n08 Management and Commerce\n0801 Accounting\n0803 Business and Management\n0805 Sales and Marketing\n0807 Tourism\n0809 Office Studies\n0811 Banking, Finance and related fields\n0899 Other Management and Commerce\n0919 Economics and Econometrics\nFor more information, please refer to Fields of Education or contact the ANU College of Business & Economics.\nFor more information see: http://www.anu.edu.au/students/program-administration/costs-fees\nFor further information on International Tuition Fees see: https://www.anu.edu.au/students/program-administration/fees-payments/international-tuition-fees\nAll students are required to pay the Services and amenities fee (SA Fee)\nThe annual indicative fee provides an estimate of the program tuition fees for international students and domestic students (where applicable). The annual indicative fee for a program is based on the standard full-time enrolment load of 48 units per year (unless the program duration is less than 48 units). Fees for courses vary by discipline meaning that the fees for a program can vary depending on the courses selected. Course fees are reviewed on an annual basis and typically will increase from year to year. The tuition fees payable are dependent on the year of commencement and the courses selected and are subject to increase during the period of study.\nFor further information on Fees and Payment please see: https://www.anu.edu.au/students/program-administration/fees-payments\nANU offers a wide range of scholarships to students to assist with the cost of their studies.\nEligibility to apply for ANU scholarships varies depending on the specifics of the scholarship and can be categorised by the type of student you are.  Specific scholarship application process information is included in the relevant scholarship listing.\nFor further information see the Scholarships website.\nThe Master of Marketing Management (MMM) program equips graduates and professionals from any discipline outside of Business to become evidence-based decision-makers, innovative problem solvers, responsible social citizens, and future leaders.

Prerequisites can include a high school subject or a university unit of study, which would be required to study that program or course in a program.\nThis is a grouping of schools according to academic disciplines, where academic staff teach at undergraduate, graduate and higher degree levels and pursue research and scholarly investigations.\nThey are University approved accommodation.  To find out more, visit the Residential and Campus Communities website.\nAustralian Tertiary Admissions Rank. The figure used by universities and tertiary applications centres such as UAC/VTAC to calculate the university entrance rank.This is then used to determine eligibility for admission to undergraduate courses. This is not a mark, but rank in comparison to other students.\nAn area within a program that allows in-depth study in a particular field. A major usually consists of a set number of related courses. Majors at ANU require 48 units.Example: The Marketing Major requires 48 units of courses specified under the requirements for the Marketing Major.\nA minor has fewer requirements to fulfil than a major, in terms of points and compulsory courses. Minors at ANU require 24 units.Example: The French Minor requires 24 units of courses specified under the requirements for the French Minor.\nSimilar to minors, specialisations are areas of studies with their own courses that are allowed to be taken in conjunction with a specific related major.Example: The Astronomy and Astrophysics specialisation requires 24 units of courses and is available to students who complete a Physics Major, Theoretical Physics Major, Mathematics Major or Mathematical Modelling Major.\nAn optional area of study selected in addition to the core courses of the program. Electives may allow you to delve more deeply into an area of study, or focus on an alternative area of interest that you may have. Many people will use electives to complete an additional major or minor.\nEach university has different terminology to describe their programs and the specific requirements of those programs. Some of these terms are “units”, “subjects” and “courses”, and whilst some terms are interchangeable, at ANU there is a general understanding of what these terms mean:>> Course: An area of study usually of one semester in length. Each course is normally assigned a unit value.Example: COMP1100 Introduction to Programming and Algorithms.>> Unit: a unit is an indicator of the value of a course – most courses are valued at 6 units.\nSome institutions assume that you have knowledge of specified courses or equivalent before beginning your course. If you do not have the assumed level of knowledge, but have met the admission requirements you may still be selected for the course, but you may have some difficulty coping with your studies. You may need to do a bridging course if you do not have the assumed level of knowledge.\nThese courses are designed to help you to get up to speed if you lack the assumed knowledge to start your program. They offer students the opportunity to revise and extend their knowledge in specific areas – often in chemistry, mathematics and physics. While they are strongly recommended for commencing students, they are not prerequisites.\nResponsible Officer: Registrar, Student Administration / Page Contact: Website Administrator / Frequently Asked Questions\n• Search ANU web, staff & maps\n\nSearch current site content\n• Search current site content\n• Programs and Courses\n• Frequently Asked Questions",

Admission to most ANU programs is on a competitive basis. Therefore, meeting all admission requirements does not automatically guarantee entry.\nIn line with the University's admissions policy and strategic plan, an assessment for admission may include competitively ranking applicants on the basis of specific academic achievement, English language proficiency and diversity factors.

ANU endeavours to recruit and maintain a diverse and deliberate student cohort representative not only of Australia, but the world. In order to achieve these outcomes, competitive ranking of applicants may be adjusted to ensure access to ANU is a reality for brilliant students from countries across the globe.\nAssessment of qualifications: Unless otherwise indicated, ANU will accept all Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF) qualifications or international equivalents that meet or exceed the published admission requirements of our programs, provided all other admission requirements are also met.\nWhere an applicant has more than one completed tertiary qualification, ANU will base assessment on the qualification that best meets the admission requirements for the program. Find out more about the Australian Qualifications Framework: www.aqf.edu.au.\nUnless otherwise indicated, where an applicant has more than one completed tertiary qualification, ANU will calculate the GPA for each qualification separately. ANU will base assessment on the best GPA of all completed tertiary qualifications of the same level or higher.\nANU uses a 7-point Grade Point Average (GPA) scale. All qualifications submitted for admission at ANU will be converted to this common scale, which will determine if an applicant meets our published admission requirements.

The annual indicative fee for a program is based on the standard full-time enrolment load of 48 units per year (unless the program duration is less than 48 units). Fees for courses vary by discipline meaning that the fees for a program can vary depending on the courses selected. Course fees are reviewed on an annual basis and typically will increase from year to year. The tuition fees payable are dependent on the year of commencement and the courses selected and are subject to increase during the period of study.\nFor further information on Fees and Payment please see: https://www.anu.edu.au/students/program-administration/fees-payments\nANU offers a wide range of scholarships to students to assist with the cost of their studies.\nEligibility to apply for ANU scholarships varies depending on the specifics of the scholarship and can be categorised by the type of student you are.  Specific scholarship application process information is included in the relevant scholarship listing.\nFor further information see the Scholarships website.\nThe Master of Marketing Management (MMM) program equips graduates and professionals from any discipline outside of Business to become evidence-based decision-makers, innovative problem solvers, responsible social citizens, and future leaders.
