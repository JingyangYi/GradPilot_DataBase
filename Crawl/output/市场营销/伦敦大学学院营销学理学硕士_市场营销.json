These entry requirements apply to all our Teacher Training PGCE courses.\nA first or second-class UK Bachelor’s degree in an appropriate subject, or an overseas qualification of an equivalent standard from a recognised higher education institution is normally required.\nCandidates who are judged not to have sufficient subject knowledge for certain secondary PGCE courses may be required to undertake a Subject Knowledge Enhancement (SKE) course. The length of SKE varies depending on the need of the individual – from eight-week ‘refresher’ or ‘booster’ courses, through to more extensive 36-week courses.\nFor some courses, applicants whose degree qualifications are lower than 2:2 standard may be admitted if they can demonstrate an appropriate academic background at master’s level and above and/or significant postgraduate experience in the relevant field.\nPlease note that we will not consider applicants to any Initial Teacher Education (ITE) programmes that already hold the professional teaching qualification that the intended UCL PGCE programme leads to - QTS, QTLS, EYTS. For example, an applicant who already holds Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) is ineligible to apply for any ITE course that leads to QTS.\nFor all courses, a GCSE, or comparable qualification, at grade C or 4 is required in English Language and Mathematics.\nFor Primary education, (pupils aged 3–11) and Early Years Initial Teacher Training (EYITT) working with children aged 0-5; a GCSE grade C or 4 is also required in a science subject (we do not accept Additional Science or Applied Science). Please note that the PGCE Primary (Specialist Mathematics) course requires a GCSE grade 5 in Mathematics.\nWe do not accept English taught as a second language or English Literature to meet our GCSE English Language requirements.\nWe do not accept BTEC, functional skills or Access qualifications in place of GCSEs.\nApplicants who do not offer a GCSE in English Language or Mathematics at grade 4 may demonstrate an equivalent standard by completing either the Mathematics Foundation, Mathematics Higher or English from Equivalency Testing or A Star Equivalency and achieve at least a grade 4.\nFor GCSE Science we will accept either Combined Science or Biology taken with one of these providers.\nIf you are made an offer you will be required to successfully complete Occupational Health and Disclosure Barring Service (DBS) Enhanced Disclosure checks.\nFrom October 2024, the Occupational Health Check is £100 and, depending on your DBS requirements, there may be an additional fee between £12.75 to £25.50, depending on the number of documents checked, if you submit your DBS Enhanced Disclosure check via a UK Post Office.\nAll teacher training candidates who are offered a place at UCL must be certified as meeting national requirements for physical and mental fitness to teach, as set by the Department for Education. We apply the Fitness to Teach requirement to all our PGCE candidates who must complete a health questionnaire for scrutiny by our occupational health provider.\nIf you are offered a place on a teacher training courses, you will be asked to apply for an Enhanced, Child-workforce, fee paid Disclosure certificate from the Disclosure Barring Service (DBS). A satisfactory certificate is a condition of entry to the course, as we need to assess your suitability for access to children and vulnerable adults. This document will contain details of any cautions, convictions, reprimands, warnings or bindovers recorded against your name (even where they would ordinarily be considered spent) or confirm that you have none.\nIf the ITE Admissions team is able to confirm that you hold a DBS certificate valid for entry to a UCL PGCE course, which is also registered with the DBS Update Service, you will not be required to complete a new DBS check linked to UCL. If you do not have a valid DBS Update Service subscription then you will need to complete a new DBS linked to UCL. Maintaining a subscription to the DBS Update Service throughout the PGCE course is recommended.\nIf you have lived, worked, studied or travelled in any single country outside of the UK for six continuous months or more, in the last five years, you will be required to obtain a Certificate of Good Conduct from the relevant country/countries. Please note that absences of less than six weeks, from a country outside of the UK are not considered as a break in residency. Please note that the police check should be applied for within one month of your departure date to ensure the police certificate issued covers the period you were in a country.\nPossession of a criminal record will not necessarily bar you from entry to your chosen course of study. If your disclosure certificate reveals details about an offence or other matter, we will ask you to provide a brief written account of the circumstances of the incident(s) and any mitigating factors that you feel are relevant, in order to make an informed decision on your suitability for admission. Please refer to our policy statement on the recruitment of ex-offenders.\nFurther information about the Enhanced Disclosure check will be provided in our offer letter, if your application to UCL is successful.\nStudents who are enrolled on an initial teacher training course at UCL which will involve a placement with a primary school or setting in its later years provision and/or early years provision (nursery and reception classes) need to be aware of the requirements of the following:\nAccording to the above legislation, it is an offence for a student teacher who is disqualified from working in early years childcare or relevant later years childcare to do so or to be directly involved in the management of such provision. Please see our guidance document for more information on the grounds for disqualification.\nBoth the Act and Regulations mean that we will ask offer holders for certain UCL courses to provide a self-declaration form to UCL.\nEarly years childcare includes any supervised activity for a young child which takes place on a school’s premises during or outside of the normal school day.  A child is considered a ‘young child’ for the period up to 1 September after their 5th birthday.  Any teaching placements in nursery and reception classes will be classed as early years childcare.\nLater years childcare includes provision by a school for children who are not in early years but who are under the age of 8, which takes place on a school’s premises outside of the normal school day. This includes wraparound care before and after the school day, such as breakfast clubs and after school care. It does not include teaching during the school day or extended school hours for co-curricular activities such as sports activities.\nWe have set out below what this means for your application depending on which teacher training course you have applied to study on.\nIf you are offered a place on the above courses, including through the IOE Lead Partner Direct route, you will be required to submit a self-declaration form before you enrol. This form will ask you to declare whether you have been disqualified from a childcare role. More information on how to complete and submit this form will be sent to all successful applicants.\nYour employer will be responsible for making sure that you are not disqualified from a childcare role.\nIf you are offered a place on the above courses, including through the IOE Lead Partner Direct route, you will be required to sign a declaration confirming that you have read the information regarding childcare disqualification and return this to UCL. More information on how to complete and submit this form will be sent to all successful applicants.\nIf you are a successful applicant who is then placed in a nursery or reception class you will be asked to complete the childcare disqualification declaration before you go on placement. This will ask you to declare whether you have been disqualified from working in a childcare role. If, at this stage, it becomes clear that any of the disqualification criteria apply to you then UCL will ensure that you are not placed in an early years childcare placement.\nIf any of the disqualification criteria apply to you and you will be undertaking a placement in early years childcare as part of your UCL initial teacher training course, then you will not be able to enrol on your initial teacher training course at UCL unless you have a waiver from Ofsted before the commencement of the course.\nThe disqualified individual must apply for the waiver from Ofsted themselves. For more information, please see the guidance issued by Ofsted.\nAll EYITT, Primary and Secondary Trainees will be assured against a set of fundamental Mathematics and English skills by the end of their teacher training.\nSchool experience is not a mandatory entry requirement for our PGCE courses. For this reason, you do not need to have completed school experience prior to applying. However, we tend to find that applicants with experience perform better if invited to interview and we would therefore recommend that you endeavour to gain experience as soon as it becomes practical to do so. If you have future experience already arranged, please be sure to mention this in your application.\nThe English language level for teacher training programmes is UCL Level 2.\nUCL requires two suitable references.\nIt is expected that one of your references will be academic and from someone who has taught you at degree level, unless you have been out of higher education for more than five years.\nAs two references are required, you may provide one professional reference in place of the second academic reference.\nYou will be asked to enter the details of your referees in your application form. Your referees will be sent an email asking them to write a reference for you and to submit it online. For EYITT PGCE applicants, referees will be contacted as soon as the application is submitted. For all other PGCE programmes, referees will be contacted when you accept your conditional offer.\nPlease ensure you have spoken to your chosen referees so that they are expecting the invitation and are happy to provide a reference for you online.\nWhen providing the email address for your referee, where possible please use an academic or professional address rather than a personal address, e.g. [john.smith@university.ac.uk] rather than [johnsmith@hotmail.com]. UCL may require further information from references provided via personal email addresses, which may delay the process.\n• Childcare Act 2006 (Act)\n• Childcare (Disqualification) and Childcare (Early Years Provision Free of Charge) (Extended Entitlement) (Amendment) Regulations 2018 (Regulations)\n• DfE statutory guidance, Disqualification Under the Childcare Act 2006 (DUCA)\n• Childcare Disqualification – Grounds for Disqualification\n• Graduate degrees\n• Taught degrees Taught Degrees\nApplying for Graduate Taught Study at UCL\n• Taught degrees\n• Taught Degrees\n• Applying for Graduate Taught Study at UCL\n• Taught degrees\n• Taught Degrees\n• Applying for Graduate Taught Study at UCL\n• Research degrees\n• Research Degrees\n• Funded Research Opportunities\n• Doctoral School\n• Funded Doctoral Training Programmes\n• Applying for Graduate Research Study at UCL\n• Teacher training\n• Teacher Training\n• Early Years PGCE courses\n• Primary PGCE courses\n• Secondary PGCE courses\n• Further Education PGCE programme\n• Entry requirements\n• How to apply\n• The IOE approach\n• Teacher training in the heart of London\n• Why choose UCL?\n• Why choose UCL?\n• Entrepreneurship\n• Inspiring facilities and resources\n• Careers and employability\n• UCL Impact\n• Your global alumni community\n• Your wellbeing\n• Postgraduate Students' Association\n• Your life in London\n• Your life in London\n• Accommodation\n[GRID_TABLE]\nGraduate degrees \n\n\nEntry requirements \nRead details on UCL’s minimum entrance requirements for teacher training courses.

Find more specific information about a programme’s content from that academic department’s website.\nMost opportunities (and potential funding) are not advertised or packaged as studentships. If you meet the entry requirements, be proactive to identify opportunities with UCL academics whose recent research closely match your interests.\nThere are three main ways to identify an appropriate supervisor to contact:\nBefore you apply, contact the academic department to discuss your suitability and to ensure a suitable supervisor is available\nIf an academic is impressed with your research experience and proposal, they may be able to help you identify sources of funding (including from their own, or departmental, research funds). They can also nominate you for scholarships.\nNot sure which programme to apply to or about life at UCL? Join one of our many recruitment events.\nYou need to check you meet the minimum academic and English language entry requirements for the programme. Entry requirements are clearly listed on each programme’s prospectus page.\nCarefully consider how you will fund your studies. This includes tuition fees and the day-to-day costs of being a research student.\nSee our scholarship and funding pages to check if you are eligible for UCL funding. This is a separate application and different deadlines apply.\nIf you are an international student, you might need a visa to study at UCL. Please check our immigration and visas pages for more information about applying for a visa to study.\nFor graduate research degree programmes at UCL, there may be the possibility to transfer into a programme from another institution or department.\nThe number of references needed to support your application can be found on the prospectus page for your programme. See selecting your references for details on who to choose.\nyou should contact your nominated referee(s) before starting your application to check they can provide a reference for you\nSee your programme’s prospectus page for deadline information.\nIf your programme has a set application deadline, you must submit your application before 5pm (UK time) on the day of the application deadline.\nIf your programme has no application deadline, we recommend you apply at least 4 months before your intended start date.\nif you are applying for funding, there may be separate deadlines set by the academic department\nAs part of your application, you must provide the following supporting documents:\nApplications should be submitted online.\nBefore you submit your application, please carefully check the information you have provided or uploaded. Once you have submitted your application, you can only update your name, contact details, referees’ details (if applicable) and passport details (if you require a visa).\nyou cannot replace or add additional documents once you have submitted your application\nYou should make sure:\nIf you are unable to apply online due to accessibility reasons, please contact Graduate Admissions.\nWe advise that you add donotreplyadmissions@ucl.ac.uk to your list of approved contacts so that you receive any correspondence sent by the Graduate Admissions Office.\n• Browse research programmes to find centres of research in your area of interest. Click through to the department or centre website to find staff profiles.\n• Search for relevant academic units and potential supervisors by keyword using UCL’s Institutional Research Information System (IRIS). Not all academics are listed in IRIS but it is a good place to start.\n• Search our online research repository (UCL Discovery) where all UCL’s research papers are published, subject to approvals. If you identify a research paper that particularly interests you, it is likely that one of the authors would be a suitable research supervisor.\n• Your official transcript. Please read our guide on getting your academic transcript. This explains exactly what UCL can and cannot accept. Sending documents that cannot be accepted will delay your application being processed.\n• A research proposal. Your research proposal is an important part of your application. It should outline the area of research you wish to undertake, demonstrate your knowledge of the subject area and summarise the question you want to answer through your research.\n• If you need a visa to study at UCL you will need to provide a copy of your current passport.

In contemporary marketing, data has become a cornerstone for informed decision-making. Marketing managers are now tasked with deciphering vast datasets to extract actionable insights. In this module you will be introduced to the programming language Python, a powerful tool in marketing analytics due to its versatility and efficiency. Python allows marketing managers to not only handle large datasets but also employ advanced analytical techniques to understand consumer behaviours and predict market trends. It is also invaluable in automating data-related tasks, enabling marketing managers to streamline processes, saving time and resources.\nThis module will take you on a journey from the fundamental concepts of programming to more sophisticated methods that allow you to deal with collecting data from common sources such as APIs and analyse it using core Python libraries. You will develop the skills that will make you more productive and allow you to focus on analysing and communicating your results.\nThere is no requirement that you have previously learned to code. The module will cater for students with widely differing programming experience, including those with none.\nThis module description was last updated on 3rd April 2025.\nFor a list of modules related to climate change as well as social and environmental sustainability at UCL, type 'climate' or 'sustainability' into the search.
