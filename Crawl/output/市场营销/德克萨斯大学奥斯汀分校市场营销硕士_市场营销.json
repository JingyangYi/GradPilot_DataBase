Successful design and implementation of marketing strategies involves the identifying and measuring customers’ needs and wants, selecting and targeting appropriate customer segments, and developing an appropriate mix of products, pricing, promotion and distribution to attract, retain, and develop customers that help achieve the firm’s performance goals. Learning objectives in this course include developing a structured and disciplined approach to the analysis of marketing problems; sharpening decision-making skills by making and defending marketing decisions in the context of realistic problem situations; appreciating how the elements of a successful marketing program fit together.\nBA S 385T | 3 credits | core course\nFinancial management provides an introduction to fundamental concepts in finance. These concepts provide a framework for analyzing capital budgeting decisions (the investment decision). Examples of investment decisions could include whether a firm should start a new product line or offer a warranty with a product. In order to understand capital budgeting, we must also study several underlying topics such as the goal of the firm, time value of money, financial statements, cash flows, and the cost of capital. This course introduces students to these concepts and their application through a combination of lectures and problems.\nMKT S 382 | 3 credits | core course\nThis course engages with real-world data using the language of statistics to build models and apply analytical techniques that facilitate business decision-making. You will learn tools and approaches to address a fundamental question: understanding relationships between variables. Linear (and generalized linear) models will be applied in determining the existence of such relationships and in quantifying the strength of the relationship. Particular emphasis will be given throughout the course to enhancing your skill-set with software that facilitates the organization and visualization of data as well as the estimation and interpretation of statistical models.\nAverage of 14 credit hours taken in the fall\nMKT 382  | 3 credits | core course\nThis course will provide students with an introduction to a variety of approaches to analyzing firm marketing actions. Specific topics include quantifying customer value, preference measurement, attitudinal and behavioral market segmentation and targeting, customer economics, product management, pricing and advertising response models and digital marketing analytics.\nModern marketing uses databases extensively. For example, direct marketing uses consumer or business databases to generate customized targeting strategies in order to promote products and services. In this course, we will learn the skills of accessing, manipulating, and displaying marketing databases in order to gain insights into consumer behavior and business practices. This course will offer highly sought-after technical resources for marketers, such as using the Structured Query Language (SQL) to access and manipulate large database, R statistical and programming environment for data visualization and Python for web data scraping.\nMKT 282  | 2 credits | core course\nThe aim of the course is to develop rigorous yet practical insights into topics ranging from nonlinear pricing, price customization, revenue management, bundling and versioning, channel pricing and auction designs in dynamic settings. Using real data sets and detailed exercises, these tools and concepts will be applied to diverse contexts and industries ranging from search engines to airlines, hotels and casinos to entertainment, online retailing, utilities, social media and self-improvement products. Beyond pricing issues, another aim of this class is to develop analytical skills that could be applied in diverse setting ranging from business to policy issues to major global issues that confront an informed citizenry.\nMKT 182 | 1 credit | elective course\nBias and stereotypes are everywhere, and they’ve been around since the beginning of time. Therefore, it should not be a surprise that they exist (and in some cases flourish) in the field of marketing. In this course we will examine the origins of bias and how it works its way into brands – be it through internal marketing, external agencies, or the media. We will also explore the secret weapon companies are using to combat bias day-to-day, and how it’s changing the way we do business.\nProducts (and services) are at the heart of marketing and managing the balance between successful introduction of new products while continuing to market current products is often the key to a firm’s sustained growth. This course will expose students to the principles of product management including assessing the health and profitability of a product portfolio, developing go-to-market strategies for new products, and positioning and repositioning of current products. In addition, the course will address the basic building blocks of growing and managing a brand while integrating it seamlessly into the overall marketing activities of the firm.\nData visualization is becoming an increasingly sought-after skill set in the workforce and a core component to the Business Intelligence processes. This course will introduce data visualization best practices and expose students to Tableau as a tool for visualizing data. Students will develop skills in graphically representing complex data for the purpose of summarizing, interpreting, and deriving business decisions.\nIn the face of intensifying and diversifying competition, many companies, from start-ups to large corporations, are now looking to infuse their marketing efforts with a human-centered design discipline in an effort to become innovation leaders in their respective industries and create true value for their customers. This course will focus on the overall design process, along with specific research tools and evaluation methodologies to build empathy and define key customer problems to solve. We will also explore best practices for idea generation, prototyping potential solutions, and testing through iterative cycles.\nAverage of 13 credit hours taken in the spring\nThe marketing intelligence capstone course is a hands-on learning experience aimed at pulling together all of the different tools and frameworks learned across the MSM curriculum. Students work in teams with an organization on a real marketing problem. This gives students the opportunity to tackle a problem with imperfect data, uncertainty, a constantly changing environment, and real deliverables. Students will work under the advisement of the faculty member, as well as with individuals from the “client” organization. In addition to a deep hands-on experience, the course includes workshops and case studies with practitioners from several different organizations providing students with exposure to cutting edge techniques and best practices.\nThe effectiveness of marketing decisions highly depends on the information obtained through marketing analytics. Marketing analytics allows companies to gain an advantage by serving customers better than competitors do. The course Marketing Analytics II builds upon Marketing Analytics I and will cover a number of advanced analytics problems focusing on methodologies and their implementations.\nStudents will enhance their knowledge and understanding of how marketing analytics is applied in practice and can benefit marketing decision-making. There is a high level of “hands-on” knowledge and active learning involved, so that students will be able to implement the techniques in their future careers. Teamwork is an important part of this course as well. Students collaborate with team members on projects covering an array of practical business settings and communicate findings and recommendations in written reports and in-class presentations. Different research designs, methods of model estimation (Bayesian and frequentist), marketing models and analyses are discussed and applied in individual and team projects. The course helps students to gain hands-on knowledge of marketing analytics and how to use and interpret the information it provides. The scope will range from qualitative to experimental and quantitative analyses used to support marketing decisions. Projects focus on topics such as experimental design, conjoint analysis for new product development, resource allocation in the context of customer satisfaction, market segmentation, brand positioning, pricing, new customer acquisition, and customer retention.\nThis course will introduce behavioral marketing, both as a topic and a way of thinking and gathering data. We will both read about research and conduct our own experiment, including gathering data and analyzing the results.\nIn today’s world, it is difficult to imagine running a business without an online presence. Consumers spend a significant portion of their time online, and, when buying a product, they may collect information from the web, make a purchase on the web, or both. For many companies, the web has become a crucial component of their marketing strategy. This course is designed to provide students with knowledge pertaining to these strategies. This course has three main objectives. (1) Students will gain background knowledge to navigate Internet Marketing topics including online advertising, search, social media, and online privacy. (2) Students will learn to design, implement, and evaluate an experiment to measure the effectiveness of online business decisions. (3) Students will become certified users of HootSuite, a social media management platform. Additionally, students will learn and apply best practices for social media marketing.\nThis course exposes students to industry data that are used by marketers to understand consumer demand from both an aggregate (retail outlet) and disaggregate (individual household) perspective. Students will gain experience developing insights from data that are used to guide business decision making. Specific emphasis in the class will be given to building demand models that incorporate elements of the marketing mix for the purpose of attribution analysis. The course will be taught using the R statistical computing environment. Both project-based and individual performance assessment will be aspects of the course. This course is useful for individuals seeking careers in brand management, retail analytics, management consulting, and product management.\nAdvanced SQL for data analysis. This course builds on material introduced in Data Analysis & Visualization. Topics include advanced SQL SELECT techniques, joins, index use, transactions, database schemas, and data modeling. Emphasis is on practical queries and navigating schemas.\n• News\n• Events\n• Directory\n• Give\n• Contact\n[GRID_TABLE]\nMarketing Management\nBA S 381T | 3 credits | core course\nMarketing is the business function that addresses the design and implementation of strategies that serve to create, build and sustain value for the firm’s customers, and to capture a portion of that value for the firm.

For detailed information about establishing Texas residency for tuition purposes, check out the Texas Residency Admission FAQ.\nWe understand that graduate school is an investment. All students admitted to MS programs have access to a financial aid team to help secure funding for tuition and living costs. Reach out to your McCombs Financial Aid Team with questions.\nIf you are a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, you’ll likely be eligible for federal student loans. To determine your eligibility, you must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).\nThe FAFSA is available October 1 of each year for the next school year and it is recommended that you have both the current year and next year’s FAFSAs completed no later than June 1st prior to when your program begins. The UT Austin School Code is 003658.\nOnce your FAFSAs have been successfully processed, you will be offered federal loans to cover your full estimated cost of attendance for the summer, fall, and spring semesters.\nYou can check the status of your FAFSA after it has been submitted by visiting the “Status/Requirements” page in your Check Aid Status Here (CASH) portal.\nWe will begin packaging McCombs students’ financial aid in June for the upcoming aid year. If you do not receive a Financial Aid Notification (FAN) by the end of June, please feel free to email us at FinancialAid@mccombs.utexas.edu.\nAs an international student, you may have loan options available. Better loan terms may be available if you have a U.S. citizen or permanent resident as a co-signer.\nThough loan terms will likely be less preferable, there are a few lenders that do not require a U.S. cosigner to be approved. We are not able to recommend any lenders specifically and would instead advise doing an internet search to see what options are out there. We will work with all banks and lending institutions.\nWe, as the University of Texas at Austin, cannot be your co-signer.\nIf you choose to pursue a private loan, we recommend applying no sooner than a few months before the start of your program. Ethically, we cannot recommend a lender; you must do research to find lenders who meet your needs. Most private loans are credit-based, and the approval decision may expire. Check with your lender about the length of time your application will remain valid before you apply.\nWhen applying, you must use loan periods that match what is used by The Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid (OSFA) for processing loans. If your lender provides pre-selected loan periods, we recommend you contact the lender to get the loan periods on your application updated to match what UT Austin uses.\nYou can opt to apply for each semester individually, but you can also group fall and spring together as fall/spring. Summer loans require a separate application and cannot be grouped with any other semester. For example, you cannot have any of the following combinations: summer/fall, spring/summer, summer/fall/spring, or fall/spring/summer.\nPlease use the following loan periods as needed during your time in the program.\nPlease note: academic years (i.e. fall and spring) cannot be grouped together, so you will have to apply for each year separately. Please use the following loan periods as needed based on when your program begins and ends.\nIf you have questions about the loan itself, contact your lender.\nIf you have an issue with the processing of your private loan, please email us at FinancialAid@mccombs.utexas.edu and include your UT EID and program in your email.\nThere are a limited number of scholarships available to Texas McCombs MS Program students. All Texas McCombs MS Program applicants are automatically considered for these opportunities; no separate application is necessary.
