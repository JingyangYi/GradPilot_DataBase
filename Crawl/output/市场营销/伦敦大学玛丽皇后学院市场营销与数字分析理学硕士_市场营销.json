Students will develop critical insights into the changing nature of marketing, and learn how to drive campaigns and build consumer relationships within a digital environment. The programme is open to graduates of all disciplinary backgrounds and is also suitable for individuals who are looking to start or develop their own businesses.\nThe core modules aim to build foundational knowledge and skills in marketing and digital economy concepts and theories. Broad skills that will be developed during the course include:\nThis module will give you a basic introduction to research methods for marketing, starting with problem definition and question formulation, continuing onto selecting and designing appropriate research methodology and collecting data in various marketing circumstances, and finishing with essential data analysis with modern tools, and interpretation of that data. Finally, we will also work on essential tools for putting all of this together: how to communicate these ideas and findings to a broad audience in the form of a research report and oral presentation.\nThe dissertation forms an important part of the assessment of the MSc Marketing Programme, carrying a weighting of 60 credits. The dissertation involves demonstration of ability to execute a research plan and independent investigation. The investigation can rely on primary data collected by the student, on secondary data available in the literature, or a mix of both. The dissertation will reflect skills of formulating research questions, synthesising information and analysing data, drawing insights and conclusions, and written communication.\nThis module will provide an overview of what AI is and how its applications can benefit businesses on strategic and tactical levels.  Students will learn basic AI applications/algorithms and their limitations as well as utility.\nThis module interrogates the economic, social and cultural opportunities presented by the digital and platformed economy and its affordances of big data.

Students will learn the principles of business performance evaluation using analytic tools.\nThis dissertation is designed to use Open Data and to utilize the digital analytics taught in the classroom to answer a specific research question. This project is designed for students to identify open data on digital platforms and to design a study utilizing this data. This project leverages on independent work and is designed for students to apply the digital analytics taught in the programme.\nThe services sector has become one of the most important sectors from both an economic and a managerial point of view. Besides pure services providers an increasing number of 'new' services providers emerge, usually offering hybrid offerings that include goods and services components. This module provides students with an overview of important aspects of services management; outlines relevant frameworks, concepts, tools, and processes to improve the understanding of service design, management and commercialisation.\nThe aim of this module is to explore the theory and practice of planning, effectively designing social marketing strategy, implementing and evaluating social marketing campaigns, and understanding the theory, uses and impacts of behavioural science and behavioural economics on society for its common good and social justice.\nThis module is designed to expose students to the latest advancements in sustainability issues and research in the marketing discipline. The module will cover the roots of sustainability marketing as a field of research, and introduce the range of research on sustainability, from the theoretical to the empirical, and from the classic to the current. The core of this module will be boosting students' ability to integrate sustainability into the theory and practice of marketing. Readings in each session incorporate theoretical and empirical studies, giving students an opportunity to explore different ways of pursuing answers to current sustainability, CSR and ethical challenges.\nPlease note that all modules are subject to change.\nLearning outcomes are assessed using a mix of coursework, essays, projects, presentations and, in some cases, exams.

      "content": "[HEADING] Dr Zafeirenia Brokalaki\n[HEADING] Lecturer in Marketing and Communications\nProgramme Director for MSc Marketing in the Creative Industries\n[HEADING] Profile\n[HEADING] Roles:\n[HEADING] Biography:\n[HEADING] Teaching\n[HEADING] Postgraduate\n[HEADING] Administrative responsibilities\n[HEADING] Research\n[HEADING] Research Interests:\n[HEADING] Publications\n[HEADING] Supervision\n[HEADING] Public Engagement\nEmail: z.brokalaki@qmul.ac.ukRoom Number: Room 4.25 H, Francis Bancroft Building (4th floor)\nMile End Campus\nSchool of Business and Management\nZafeirenia Brokalaki is a cultural scholar working at the intersection of marketing and consumer research, cultural studies, and performance studies. She joined the School of Business and Management as Lecturer in Marketing in 2022 and currently acts as Programme Director for the MSc Marketing in the Creative Industries.\nPrior to this, she held academic positions at King’s College London (Departments of Culture, Media and Creative Industries and Digital Humanities), the University of Leicester (School of Business), the University of Arkansas (Walton College of Business), and the University of Peloponnese (School of Theatre Studies).\nHer broad research areas coalesce around the aesthetic, ethical, and political dimensions of art consumption, as well as the historical and transformative dynamics of the cultural market.\nZafeirenia holds a PhD in Culture, Media and Creative Industries from King’s College London, a PGCert in Philosophy (Hons) from the University of Cambridge, an MA in Cultural Policy and Management from the University of Warwick, an MA in Communication (Hons) from the American College of Greece, a BSc in Marketing and Communication from the Athens University of Economics and Business, and a BA in Dance, Choreography, and Dance Education from the Higher Professional Dance Academy of Greece (D. Gregoriadou).\nShe is Editor of Arts and the Market (Emerald) and serves on the Editorial Board of Qualitative Market Research: An International Journal (Emerald).\nZafeirenia is a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (HEA, Hons) and the Royal Society of Arts (RSA).\nProgramme Director for MSc Marketing in the Creative Industries\nZafeirenia’s research broadly explores the aesthetics, politics, and ethics of markets and consumption, with a distinct emphasis on the cultural sector. Her work concentrates on marketing and audience development in the cultural and creative industries (CCIs), as well as the dynamics of art consumption. Central to her inquiry are the concepts of participation and creativity, and their complex entanglement with market structures and logics, framed within a wider historical evolution of the arts market. Her scholarship further engages with questions surrounding creative epistemologies, storytelling, and dramaturgical approaches to marketing. More recently, her scholarly attention has expanded to the marketability of the body, laying the groundwork for a new project tracing the genealogy of the performing body on stage. Her forthcoming research agenda includes a critical investigation of cultural policies designed to support marketplace participation, accessibility, and justice - particularly within the performing arts and heritage as vital domains of the CCIs.\nInterdisciplinary in nature, Zafeirenia’s research is primarily theory-driven, drawing on and integrating perspectives from philosophy, cultural studies, sociology and political studies, art history, and performance studies to contribute to theoretical development in marketing and consumer scholarship. In her empirical work, she adopts an interpretive/hermeneutic (qualitative) methodological approach to critically interrogate contemporary cultural marketplace phenomena and the evolution of market structures and transformations.\nHer contributions align with and advance the progressive strands of interpretive, cultural, and critical marketing, and are situated in the nexus of scholarly traditions such as the Interpretive Consumer Research, Consumer Culture Theory (CCT), Transformative Consumer Research (TCR), Critical Marketing, Historical Marketing and Macromarketing. These streams collectively interrogate the normative foundations of market society and propose alternative imaginaries for organising markets and consumption. Looking ahead, Zafeirenia aims to foreground the philosophy of aesthetics and ethics in marketing and business research, pedagogy, and practice.\nHer research has been published in leading journals such as the Journal of Business Ethics, Journal of Business Research, Journal of Marketing Management, Journal of Customer Behaviour, Journal of Creative Behaviour, Journal of Historical Research in Marketing, City, Journal of Promotional Communications, as well as in edited marketing books.\nShe has presented her work at major academic conferences, including the Association for Consumer Research Conference (ACRC), the International Conference on Arts and Cultural Management (AIMAC), the Consumer Culture Theory Conference (CCTC), the European Marketing Academy Conference (EMAC), the Transformative Consumer Research Conference (TCR), the Academy of Marketing Conference (AM), the Gender, Markets and Consumer Conference (GENMAC), the Conference of Historical Analysis and Research in Marketing (CHARM), the Royal Geographical Society Conference (RGS), the Dance Studies Association Conference (CORD + SDHS), the Place Management and Branding Conference (IPBA), the International Visual and Performing Arts Conference (ATINER), the International Conference on Contemporary Marketing Issues (ICCMI), and the European Urban Research Association Conference (EURA), among others.\nZafeirenia is Editor of Arts and the Market (Emerald) and serves on the Editorial Board of Qualitative Market Research: An International Journal (Emerald). She also reviews for the Journal of Business Ethics, Social Enterprise Journal, The Arts Journal, Citizenship Studies, Sustainability, Journal of Museum Management and Curatorship, Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing, and serves as a Trainee Reviewer for the Journal of Consumer Research.\nZafeirenia welcomes new PhD students that are interested in the following research areas:\nCurrent PhD students\nZafeirenia is an Impact Fellow at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL), where she leads the research project Impact Stories in collaboration with creative enterprises based in East and South-East London.\nShe has previously contributed to a range of funded public engagement initiatives supported by universities, public bodies, and cultural organisations, including Nesta, Arts Council England (ACE), the Victoria and Albert Museum, CreativeWorks London, the Older People’s Commissioner for Wales, UCL, King’s Cultural Institute, Tima Foundation, the University of Leicester, UL Innovation Hub, the CAMEo Research Institute for Cultural and Media Economies, and Queen Mary University of London.\nIn addition to her academic roles, Zafeirenia has served as a researcher, marketing consultant, and fundraiser for numerous cultural and non-profit organisations, social enterprises, charities, and creative SMEs in both the UK and Greece. Her collaborators have included Birmingham Royal Ballet, Dance Umbrella, the Victoria and Albert Museum, Opera Holland Park, East London Dance, the London School of Business and Finance, King’s College London, Emergency Exit Arts, Associated Studios, artfix London, Sinthesis Company, the Athens Fringe Network, the International Athens Film Festival, Rokka Festival, Demand for Supply, Metaxoto, and Paros Wind Festival, among others.\n• School of business and management\n• Staff\n• Academic Staff\n• Profiles\n• Profile\n• Teaching\n• Research\n• Publications\n• Supervision\n• Public Engagement\n• Lecturer in Marketing and Communications\n• Programme Director for MSc Marketing in the Creative Industries\n• BUSM241 - Backstage: Global Marketing Strategies for the Creative Industries\n• BUSM240 - Marketing Arts and Culture for Social Change\n• BUSM206 - Global Marketing and Communications\n• BUSM213 - Social Marketing for Social Justice\n• Dissertation Supervision\n• Programme Director for MSc Marketing in the Creative Industries\n• Postgraduate Module Leadership\n• Brokalaki, Z. and Murray, J.

Queen Mary will therefore not further consider these circumstances as part of its decision making.\nEducation providers and examination bodies can provide reasonable adjustments for disabilities or long-term conditions (including specific learning differences and mental health diagnoses) that may affect students during their studies or examinations and we would expect that adequate and appropriate measures would have been put in place.
