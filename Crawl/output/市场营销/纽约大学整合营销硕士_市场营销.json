We encourage you to explore other factors such as our academic programs, NYU resources, SPS faculty experts who are respected professionals in their fields, and student experiences to make an informed decision about your enrollment.\nWhat is the difference between official and unofficial transcripts?\n\nTo be considered official, application materials must be sent to the Office of Admissions directly from the institution, testing service, or recommender.\nFor a transcript to be considered final official, it must be received directly from the university, have all final grades, and have a degree conferral date.\nUnofficial transcripts can be submitted, for application review purposes, electronically by either the applicant or the institution. If you are admitted based on an unofficial transcript and wish to enroll and register for coursework, you will be required to submit your official transcript that shows your degree conferral date prior to the end of your first term of enrollment.\nMay I submit unofficial transcripts for the application review process?\n\nYes. The Office of Admissions uses unofficial transcripts to review applications unless an official copy was specifically requested by your admissions officer. Students who have been accepted into the NYU School of Professional Studies will be sent further instructions on how to send their official copies prior to the start of the term.\n\nHow to Submit Your Transcripts\nHow do I submit official transcripts?\n\nThe Office of Admissions accepts unofficial documents for the application review process and we ask that prospective students do not send official documents unless they have been admitted into one of our undergraduate programs.\n\nHow to Submit Your Transcripts\nHow do I submit unofficial transcripts?\n\nUnofficial documents can be scanned and uploaded directly into the application portal. If a document was requested by the Office of Admissions after submission, you may email it to spsdocuments@nyu.edu.\n\nHow to Submit Your Transcripts\nDo you need transcripts from educational institutions I attended many years ago?\n\nYes. In order to conduct a complete and holistic review of an application, the Office of Admissions needs to evaluate transcripts from all institutions previously attended.\nDo I need to submit a foreign transcript evaluation?\n\nInternational applicants who completed more than half of their academic program at a foreign university are required to submit an evaluation. Evaluations are a required component since they determine how your academics are graded compared to the US education system, as well as if your degree is equivalent to a US bachelor’s degree.\nWhen requesting an evaluation, please request a “course-by-course evaluation.” All transcripts must be evaluated by a recognized foreign educational credential evaluation from the list below.\n\nEducational Credential Evaluators (ECE)\nEducational Perspectives, npf\nForeign Academic Credential Service\nTranscript Research\nThe Evaluation Company (TEC)\nWorld Education Services (WES)\nWho should submit a recommendation on my behalf?\n\nRecommendations must come from either academic or professional sources. This could include supervisors, managers, former professors, program directors, etc. We encourage you to share some information with your recommendation providers about the program to which you are applying, so they can tailor their recommendation appropriately. We strongly recommend that you provide your recommender’s professional or academic email address when requesting your letters.\n\nHow to Submit a Letter of Recommendation\nHow does my recommender submit a recommendation on my behalf?\n\nYour recommender will be required to submit a recommendation using the online submission form found within the application portal. You will need to input their email address in the recommendation section of your application and your recommender will automatically receive an email from NYU containing a link and instructions on how to submit the online recommendation.\n\nHow to Submit a Letter of Recommendation\nMust all of my recommendation providers submit their letters online?\n\nYes. The Admissions Office asks that you use the online application portal to input your recommendation provider's information and request that they submit their letters electronically. It is the most efficient and timely way to facilitate the processing of your application.\n\nHow to Submit a Letter of Recommendation\nShould I wait to submit my application until all recommendations are complete?\n\nNo. You may submit your application as soon as you have completed it. The letters of recommendation will be automatically added to your application once your recommenders have completed the online recommendation form.\nDo I have to submit GRE or GMAT scores as part of my application?\n\nThe GRE and GMAT are not required to apply for our graduate degree programs.\nWhat is the school code for submitting standardized exams?\n\nStandardized test scores from ETS (TOEFL scores) can be uploaded directly into the online application or sent to us using our school code, 2557. You may select 01 for graduate management. Official IELTS scores can be sent by contacting your test center directly and request that your test scores be sent electronically to New York University, School of Professional Studies. An institutional code is not required.\nDo I need to submit TOEFL/IELTS scores with my application?\n\nApplicants who did not complete an undergraduate or graduate degree in the United States or in a program where the medium of instruction is English are required to submit TOEFL or IELTS scores. The Office of Admissions will not accept TOEFL or IELTS scores that are older than two years.\nCan I request a waiver for the English Language Proficiency Requirements?\n\nA TOEFL or IELTS waiver may be requested for the following reasons:\n\nIf an official letter is submitted by the institution stating all classes were conducted in English. Please upload this letter directly to your application along with your transcripts.\nIf it is stated on the academic transcript or school website that all classes are conducted in English.\nIf a graduate degree was conducted in English or the institution is in a country where English is the only primary language.\nIf the applicant completed 3 years of undergraduate studies at an institution where English is the medium of instruction and 1 year at their international institution.\n\n A TOEFL/IELTS waiver can only be granted after the submission of your application.\nWhat is the Video and Writing Reflection?\n\nThe Video and Writing Reflection - Powered by Kira Talent, is an online assessment tool designed to evaluate video questions and written assessments. This assessment allows the Admissions Committee to analyze skills we value such as collaboration and global-mindedness, integrity, critical and analytical thinking skills, and effective written and oral communication. The Kira assessment incorporates various components to evaluate applicants, including 1 video question and a timed writing activity.\nDuring the online assessment, you will be asked a series of questions, given prep time, and a set amount of time to respond. The assessment is brief and will take 20 to 30 minutes to complete.\n\nVideo & Written Reflection Explained\nWhen should I register for the Video and Writing Reflection?\n\nTo expedite the processing of your application, we recommend that applicants register and complete the Kira assessment promptly upon creating their graduate application. The Kira Assessment link can take 24–48 hours to appear in your application.\nHow long does it take to complete the Video and Writing Reflection?\n\nThe assessment is brief and will only take you 20–30 minutes to complete. The system allows for unlimited practice sessions but once you start the formal interview questions, you only get one chance. This allows us to capture your candid responses.\nWhen does Admissions receive my Video and Writing Reflection score?\n\nIt typically takes 3-4 weeks for the Admissions Office to receive the score.\nHelp! I’m having technical difficulties during the Video and Writing Reflection.\n\nIf you have any questions, or cannot complete Kira, please email support@kiratalent.com.\nWhat technology will I need to complete the Video and Writing Reflection?\n\nTo complete this requirement, you will need a desktop or laptop computer with a functioning webcam, microphone, and internet connection.\nI didn’t prepare for the Video and Writing Reflection. Can I retake it?\n\nApplicants may not retake the Kira. The questions asked on the Kira assessment are meant to be candid responses to allow us to understand your critical thinking skills through spontaneous answers.\nCan I defer my enrollment if offered admission?\n\nIf you are accepted, you may have the option to defer your enrollment directly through the online enrollment form. You will be given the option to defer your enrollment for up to one year from your original acceptance term. Please note that deferrals are typically only granted based on significant, extenuating circumstances.\nCan I reapply if my application is denied?\n\nStudents who have been denied admission will not be permitted to reapply to any program at the School of Professional Studies for one academic year—this includes applying as a non-matriculant student.\nHow do I confirm my decision to enroll?\n\nTo reserve your place in the program, please complete the online enrollment form (Reply Form) accessible via your acceptance letter.\nHow do I submit my tuition deposit?\n\nAs noted on your acceptance message, the tuition deposit is non-refundable and will be applied to your first term's tuition when you enroll. Your acceptance is only final once we receive your non-refundable deposit. The preferred methods of payment are credit card or electronic check.\nIf those options are not available to you, you may mail your tuition check or money order by your deposit deadline payable to  \"New York University\" at the following address:\nNYU BURSAR OFFICE\n383 Lafayette St\nNew York, NY 10003\nATTN: Tuition Deposit\nThe check or money order must be in US funds only; be sure to include your University ID number and Enrollment Term in the memo section.\nHow do I apply for an I-20?\n\nOnce you have activated your NetID, you will be able to complete the I-20 request form on the student portal. If you need assistance with the process, you should contact the NYU Office of Global Services (OGS) directly.\nWhere can I find my Net ID?\n\nTo obtain and activate your NetID, visit NYU Start. If you encounter difficulty in activating your NetID, contact the Help Desk for technical assistance at AskITS@nyu.edu or 212-998-3333.\nI have been accepted for a degree I no longer want. Can I change my program?\n\nYou may request a program change, however, we highly encourage you to first speak with your current academic advisor to discuss your academic and career goals. NYU SPS graduate programs are highly specialized degrees and when applicants submit their initial application they are expected to understand how the degree aligns with their academic and professional goals.\nIf you choose to move forward with a program change application, please note that this is not an automatic admission to the new program and your request may be accepted or denied. If your program change is approved, you will receive an email confirming the approved change. If, however, your change of program application is denied, you will have the choice to enroll in your initial degree program. The Admissions Committee will re-review your master’s degree application, based on your new program of choice. Please allow 3-4 weeks for this new application to be reviewed and processed. Please complete the program change application and submit it to the Admissions Office at sps.admissions@nyu.edu.\nNote that program changes through the NYU SPS Office of Admissions are for new students only. If you have completed any coursework towards an SPS degree, please contact your academic adviser for additional information regarding program changes as a current student.\n[GRID_TABLE]\n96%\n\n\nworking or in school in 6 months [1]\nworking or in school in 6 months [1]\nworking or in school in 6 months [1]\n$76K\n\n\nmean starting salary of master’s graduates [1]\nmean starting salary of master’s graduates [1]\nmean starting salary of master’s graduates [1]\n19%\n\n\nof master’s students attend part-time\nof master’s students attend part-time\nof master’s students attend part-time\n44%\n\n\nmaster’s students taking at least some classes online [2]\nmaster’s students taking at least some classes online [2]\nmaster’s students taking at least some classes online [2]\n62%\n\n\ninternational students\ninternational students\ninternational students\n[CARD]\nFall 2025 - Open\nROUND\n[CARD]\nSpring 2026 - Open\nROUND\n[CARD]\nSummer 2026 - Application Opens August 2025\nROUND\n[CARD]\nFall 2026 - Application Opens August 2025\nROUND\n[CARD]\nDAUS Instant Decision Day\n[CARD]\nUndergraduate Information Session\n[CARD]\nGraduate Studies Information Session\n[CARD]\n$26,502\nper term for full-time (10-12 credits)\n[CARD]\n$26,502\n[CARD]\nper term for full-time (10-12 credits)\n[CARD]\n$2,575\nper credit for part-time\n[CARD]\n$2,575\n[CARD]\nper credit for part-time\n[CARD]\nFor me, it’s about embracing different cultures and thriving in unfamiliar environments while finding inspiration in every journey.”\n[CARD]\nThe master's program helped me learn more about real-life scenarios that could happen for events as small as 100 people and as big as 10,000.\"\n[CARD]\nNYU has name-brand recognition amongst many employers.\"\n[CARD]\nEmbrace every opportunity and challenge with an open mind and a full heart.\"\n[CARD]\nHave a Question?\nHave a Question?\nNot sure where to begin, want more information, or need help completing your application?

Students work in multidisciplinary teams, in fluid consultation with organization executives and NYU SPS faculty members to research, prepare, and present their solutions on the final day of class. Selected ideas and solutions are chosen by the organization to be implemented into their business practices.\n \nReal World courses are open to all NYU students.\nHow do NYU SPS Real World courses work ?\n\nStudents start with a real business challenge from an industry partner organization. This is a real problem that the company actually wants solved. For the rest of the semester, students are divided into multidisciplinary teams comprised of students from different degree programs. They create competing pitches to be presented to a panel of executives from the partner organization. If the winning idea is feasible, students will get to see their idea implemented into the real world. Students will get first-hand exposure to real-world processes like client briefs, research, project management, and finally, the client pitch. \n \nWhile an NYU professor teaches and oversees the class, students also meet regularly with top industry executives and subject matter experts throughout the semester. They will study current trends and dive into relevant successful case studies. Classes function as labs for teams to develop plans, present assignments, and receive feedback. Experiential learning opportunities with partner organizations are also included.\nWhat are the benefits of these courses?\n\nReal World courses fulfill the promise we make to students who come to NYU SPS that they will have access to NYC industry leaders and organizations. Additionally, there are many educational and professional benefits of NYU SPS Real World courses: \n\nStudents leave the class with the ability to demonstrate so-called “soft skills” that employers prefer when evaluating candidates. These include cross-collaboration, leadership, interpersonal communication skills, empathy, problem solving, critical thinking, strategic thinking, multidisciplinary collaboration, and the ability to learn new things.\n\nStudents compile a portfolio of “real world” work that’s been implemented and lives in the world to show prospective employers.\n\nInternational students who have OPT obstacles to internships get industry experience they can claim on their resumes.\n\nStudents who work full-time, and can’t take on an internship, get industry experience they can claim on their resume.\n\nStudents work closely and directly with top, senior executives for 14-weeks.\n\nStudents are exposed to premium experiential learning with a blue-chip industry partner.\n\nStudents in Real World courses are viewed by partner organizations and their executives as future talent, leading to internships and employment.\nWhat is the feedback from industry partners about these courses?\n\n“Awesome work … The 14 weeks were well spent … from listening, to learning to leading a campaign for us … Somebody should say AMEN!” –Lisa Borders, President, WNBA\n \n“I’ve seen folks who have been in the sustainability space for years who haven’t reached the level of insight and understanding that your students did in such a short time.” –Vijay Sudan, Vice President, Social Impact, 21st Century Fox\n \n “We continually strive to find like-minded partners who seek to push the boundaries of the traditional. This collaboration with NYU SPS truly defines that.” –Neil Glat, President, New York Jets\n \n“This partnership is an excellent opportunity for students to explore real-world briefs for our brands, in tandem with us connecting with some of the brightest emerging talent of the future.” –Karyn Rockwell, CEO, FCB NY\n \n“Providing our students with real-world experience is one of the best opportunities we can give [students]. ... “This is a great example of the power of public-private partnership.” –Letitia James, Public Advocate, City of New York\nHow can I find out more?\n\nFor specific questions or inquiries please contact sps.realworld@nyu.edu\nHow do I fit this into my degree path?\n\nReal World courses typically count as electives. You may also apply for a course substitution with approval from your degree program administration. Examples of course substitutions could be practicums, capstones, internships, and courses that seem similar in content or subject matter.\nIs this course for credit?\n\nYes, these courses offer 2 or 3 credits, depending on the specific course.\nAm I eligible?\n\nGenerally, eligibility requires a minimum 3.0 GPA and completion of certain credits. Both part-time and full-time students can apply. Specific requirements are below:\n\nGraduate students\n\nOpen to both part-time and full-time NYU SPS graduate students (domestic and international)\n\nNote: Special and visiting students are not eligible\n\nMinimum of 3.0 cumulative GPA must be maintained through the start of the course\n\nCompletion of 6 credits at the time of application\n\nMay only apply to the graduate courses listed\n\n\n\n\n\nUndergraduate students\n\nOpen to both part-time and full-time NYU SPS undergraduate students (domestic and international)\n\nNote: Special and visiting students are not eligible\n\n\n\nMinimum of 3.0 cumulative GPA must be maintained through the start of the course\n\nCompletion of 36 credits (at the time of application)\n\nDivision of Applied Undergraduate Studies (DAUS)\n\nMinimum of 3.0 cumulative GPA (must be maintained through the start of the course)\n\nCompletion of 72 credits (12 completed credits at SPS) at the time of application\n\n\n\nUndergraduate students may only apply to listed undergraduate courses \n\n\n\nSteinhardt students\n\nOpen to both part-time and full-time NYU undergraduate students (domestic and international) \n\nNote: Special visiting students are not eligible\n\n\n\nMinimum of 3.0 cumulative GPA must be maintained through the start of the course\n\nJuniors and Seniors will be given preference; however, sophomores are welcome to apply\nHow do I know which course is right for me?\n\nNo matter which Real World course you take, the skills you acquire by collaboratively solving a real-world problem with top executives from A-list organizations will set you apart and make you more valuable in any professional area.
