How would you follow up a significant result which showed the risk of death had doubled? The conviction of a UK nurse, Lucy Letby, for murdering seven newborn infants has resulted in debate about whether the conviction was safe. Investigating clusters of deaths, infectious diseases or collapses in healthcare settings pose various statistical challenges for forensic investigations. In this interactive session, we will explore the standard statistical techniques and role of hypothesis testing in epidemiology and public heath. However, their use is not established within criminal investigations. We will consider how statistics are used in actual convictions and miscarriages of justice. Discussion of the important implications of this for Lucy Letby and similar cases will be encouraged. Prof Hutton is a University of Warwick professor who works in interdisciplinary statistics. She was engaged by the Cheshire police to assist with collecting and evaluation evidence related to deaths at the Countess of Chester Hospital and Lucy Letby. She has collaborated with health professionals and lawyers for many years. Her more mathematical research is inspired by questions raised by patients, doctors and lawyers.\nDescription: Chat with a representative from the University of Warwick at the upcoming SI-UK UK University Fair 2025, Toronto.

The button to the right of this\n                        shows a mini-calendar to let you quickly jump to any date.\nThe dropdown box on the right allows you to see a different view of the calendar, such\n                        as an agenda or a termly view.\nIf this calendar has tags, you can use the labelled checkboxes at the top of the page to select\n                        just the tags you wish to view, and then click \"Show selected\". The calendar will be redisplayed\n                        with just the events related to these tags, making it easier to find what you're looking for.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDay\n4 Days\nWeek\n4 Weeks\nMonth\nTerm\nAgenda\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccommodation Drop In - One to One Chat\n\n\n\n\nDate\n                            Tue, 05 Aug\n                    \n\n\nTime\n                                        10am\n                                    -\n                                        1pm\n                    \n\n\nLocation\n                            Online\n                        \n\n\nThese individual one to one chats are a quick way to ask questions and engage with the accommodation team.

How would you follow up a significant result which showed the risk of death had doubled? The conviction of a UK nurse, Lucy Letby, for murdering seven newborn infants has resulted in debate about whether the conviction was safe. Investigating clusters of deaths, infectious diseases or collapses in healthcare settings pose various statistical challenges for forensic investigations. In this interactive session, we will explore the standard statistical techniques and role of hypothesis testing in epidemiology and public heath. However, their use is not established within criminal investigations. We will consider how statistics are used in actual convictions and miscarriages of justice. Discussion of the important implications of this for Lucy Letby and similar cases will be encouraged. Prof Hutton is a University of Warwick professor who works in interdisciplinary statistics. She was engaged by the Cheshire police to assist with collecting and evaluation evidence related to deaths at the Countess of Chester Hospital and Lucy Letby. She has collaborated with health professionals and lawyers for many years. Her more mathematical research is inspired by questions raised by patients, doctors and lawyers.\n\n\n                        Tags: \n                        \nAudience: Prospective Students\n\n\nFrequency: One Off\n\n\nLevel: Undergraduate\n\n\nLocation: Online\n\n\nRegion: Any\n\n\nSchool: Statistics\n\n\nService: Admissions\n\n\nStatus: Applicant\n\n\nStatus: Enquirer\n\n\nStatus: Offer Holder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccommodation Drop In - One to One Chat\n\n\n\n\nDate\n                            Wed, 24 Sept\n                    \n\n\nTime\n                                        10am\n                                    -\n                                        1pm\n                    \n\n\nLocation\n                            Online\n                        \n\n\nThese individual one to one chats are a quick way to ask questions and engage with the accommodation team.

How would you follow up a significant result which showed the risk of death had doubled? The conviction of a UK nurse, Lucy Letby, for murdering seven newborn infants has resulted in debate about whether the conviction was safe. Investigating clusters of deaths, infectious diseases or collapses in healthcare settings pose various statistical challenges for forensic investigations. In this interactive session, we will explore the standard statistical techniques and role of hypothesis testing in epidemiology and public heath. However, their use is not established within criminal investigations. We will consider how statistics are used in actual convictions and miscarriages of justice. Discussion of the important implications of this for Lucy Letby and similar cases will be encouraged. Prof Hutton is a University of Warwick professor who works in interdisciplinary statistics.

Hypothesis Testing & The Legal System – Prof Jane Hutton, Department of Statistics\n\n\n\n\nDate\n                            Tue, 23 Sept\n                    \n\n\nTime\n                                        1:30pm\n                                    -\n                                        2:15pm\n                    \n\n\nLocation\n                            Online\n                        \n\n\nWhat hypothesis test would you use to test whether the death rate on a medical unit has suddenly increased? How would you follow up a significant result which showed the risk of death had doubled? The conviction of a UK nurse, Lucy Letby, for murdering seven newborn infants has resulted in debate about whether the conviction was safe. Investigating clusters of deaths, infectious diseases or collapses in healthcare settings pose various statistical challenges for forensic investigations. In this interactive session, we will explore the standard statistical techniques and role of hypothesis testing in epidemiology and public heath. However, their use is not established within criminal investigations. We will consider how statistics are used in actual convictions and miscarriages of justice. Discussion of the important implications of this for Lucy Letby and similar cases will be encouraged. Prof Hutton is a University of Warwick professor who works in interdisciplinary statistics. She was engaged by the Cheshire police to assist with collecting and evaluation evidence related to deaths at the Countess of Chester Hospital and Lucy Letby. She has collaborated with health professionals and lawyers for many years. Her more mathematical research is inspired by questions raised by patients, doctors and lawyers.\n\n\n                        Tags: \n                        \nAudience: Prospective Students\n\n\nFrequency: One Off\n\n\nLevel: Undergraduate\n\n\nLocation: Online\n\n\nRegion: Any\n\n\nSchool: Statistics\n\n\nService: Admissions\n\n\nStatus: Applicant\n\n\nStatus: Enquirer\n\n\nStatus: Offer Holder\n[CARD]\nAccommodation Drop In - One to One Chat\n\n\n\n\nDate\n                            Wed, 24 Sept\n                    \n\n\nTime\n                                        10am\n                                    -\n                                        1pm\n                    \n\n\nLocation\n                            Online\n                        \n\n\nThese individual one to one chats are a quick way to ask questions and engage with the accommodation team.

Monitoring\n[HEADING] Contacts\n[HEADING] Application deadlines\nThis Statement aims to provide an accessible summary of the University of Warwick’s postgraduate admissions policy and procedures, for applicants and their advisors. Where more detailed information is publicly available, this is highlighted below.\nWarwick’s admissions procedures take account of sector best practice including the precepts of the QAA’s Quality Code for Higher Education, Part B: Assuring and Enhancing Academic Quality, Chapter B2: Recruitment, Selection and Admission to Higher Education; and UCAS guidance on good practice in admissions.\nThe University aims to admit students of the highest calibre, who have the academic potential and the motivation to succeed on its challenging courses. The University encourages applications from applicants from all backgrounds and it evaluates the potential of each applicant individually and on their own merits.\nThe University aims to provide accurate, clear and transparent information and advice to prospective students concerning its opportunities for postgraduate study and complies with guidance from the Competition and Markets Authority on Student’s rights under Consumer Protection Law. All applicants for postgraduate taught programmes who receive an offer to study with us will receive Material Information relevant to their chosen programme of study, including details of core modules, contact hours and teaching and assessment methods.\nThe University welcomes applications from all candidates with the potential to succeed, regardless of their background. We are committed to equality of opportunity and our Admissions policy is compliant with relevant equality and diversity legislation.\nWarwick complies with the provisions of the EU General Data Protection Regulation(GDPR). Warwick will not disclose to a third party any details regarding an individual’s application without the applicant’s permission to do so. This policy of non-disclosure will include family members of the applicant. Warwick’s Enquiry and Applicant Privacy notice covers our use of personal data during the application process.\nWhere an applicant requires student entry clearance or leave to remain (a ‘visa’) to study in the UK, failure to take up an accepted offer of a place, or withdrawal from their course after arrival, is likely to affect their permission to come to or remain in the UK. In order to comply with the UK immigration regulations, the University will notify the immigration authorities, where relevant, of non-arrival and of any changes to a student’s enrolment status.\nThe University will publish annually the specific admissions criteria for each postgraduate course of study on its Postgraduate Study webpages.\nThe University minimum academic standard for taught postgraduate courses is a lower second class honours degree (or equivalent). For research programmes it is an upper second class honours degree (or equivalent). Where course-specific entry requirements are higher than the University minimum standard, the course-specific requirement must be achieved.\nApplicants who do not possess an academic qualification which meets or exceeds the standard required for their chosen course of study may, in some disciplines, still be considered for admission on the basis of substantial, relevant work experience, professional training or mitigating circumstances affecting their performance in previous qualifications. The admission of such candidates is subject to the approval of the Chair of the Board of Graduate Studies upon the recommendation of the appropriate Course Selector.\nWarwick is committed to giving full and fair consideration to all academic qualification information presented by individual applicants. Admissions criteria are normally expressed in terms relating to the Higher Education system within the UK. The University publishes broad equivalency guidance for applicants with qualifications from outside of the UK on its international study webpages, although candidates should note that Warwick will make an equivalency determination on a case-by-case basis only after an application has been received.\nThe University will normally require applicants to provide the contact details of one academic referee for postgraduate taught courses and two academic referees for postgraduate research courses, who will be invited to write in support of their application. The requirements for courses with non-standard reference requirements will be specified on their entry on the Postgraduate Study webpages.\nThe University will consider applications for exemption from one or more module of a taught postgraduate course as set out in its policy and procedure governing the accreditation of prior certified or experiential learning.\nAll postgraduate courses are taught in the medium of English. All applicants must demonstrate their proficiency in the use of English in all four language components (reading, writing, listening and speaking).\nThe University will publish the minimum English proficiency standard required of entrants to each of its postgraduate courses on its Postgraduate Study webpage. It should be noted that this web page indicates the minimum requirements and that the selection process is competitive. Offers may be made requiring a standard higher than this minimum.\nThe University recognises a range of English proficiency tests: details of the tests we accept can be found on our website. Applicants will be expected to reach at least the stated minimum in advance of enrolling at the University. The University will verify test results for all candidates using the test provider’s online verification service. The University reserves the right to draw to the test provider’s attention any anomalous results in order for that provider to conduct its own investigation.\nApplicants who have completed a qualification in an approved English-medium higher education institution or the duration of the degree and within the two years preceding the start of the course for which entry is sought, may not be required to provide an English proficiency test result.\nThe University provides a range of English language courses which may support those applicants whose English proficiency is close to the required standard. Further information on this provision may be found on the English Language Information & Entry Requirements website.\nThe University receives many more applications than it has places available and the admissions process is competitive. Achievement, or predicted achievement, of qualifications relevant to entry does not itself guarantee an offer of admission. Course Selectors may take into account any, or all of, applicants’ personal statements, research proposals, references, performance at interview, writing samples, work experience and test results, in addition to specific academic results.\nAll postgraduate courses are assigned a Course Selector(s). Course Selectors are either academic members of staff or professional Admissions Officers. Assessment of applications is carried out by the Course Selector(s) in close liaison with the central Admissions Service to ensure that decisions are made fairly and consistently.\nCourse Selectors will assess each application on its own merits and in competition with other applications. Course Selectors will consider all relevant evidence provided on the application form and the published entry criteria for that course. As noted above, the admission process is competitive and selection will necessarily take into account academic achievement or predicted achievement, the personal statement/research proposal, references performance at interview, writing samples, work experience and test results.\nCourse Selectors may request examples of candidates’ written work, and may choose to interview candidates, in order further to assess their motivation and suitability for the course. In the case of applications to degrees by research, an interview may also be used to discuss in detail the applicant’s suitability for their proposed project.\nIn the case of applications to degrees by research, a Course Selector will only make an offer to a candidate where an appropriate supervisor can be identified, at the point of admission, for the full period of the candidate’s enrolment with the University, taking account of study leave and any other temporary absences of members of staff.\nCourse Selectors may make an offer to a candidate for a course other than the one to which the candidate applied if the Course Selector believes the applicant to be better suited to that course, or in situations where the applicant has already covered some or all of the content of the course they originally applied to.\nUpon the recommendation of the Course Selector, the application and any supporting materials will be verified and the applicant will be notified of Warwick’s formal decision. This formal decision will be communicated to the applicant by the Admissions Service (other than in the case of applications for taught programmes offered by Warwick Manufacturing Group (WMG) which will be communicated directly to the applicant by WMG, or for the MBA/DBA programmes in Warwick Business School (WBS) which will be communicated directly to the applicant by WBS). In the case of candidates being made an offer, this offer will include any conditions which need to be met in advance of the course starting, Warwick’s Terms and Conditions of offer, and in the case of postgraduate taught programmes, will include Material Information relevant to the programme of study. Offers of study are not a guarantee of funding. Applicants will be instructed of the procedure for accepting or declining such offers.\nThe University aims to make decisions on complete applications for taught courses in four to six weeks, and for research courses in six to eight weeks. These timescales should be treated as a guideline only since the University is committed to giving applicants equal consideration and believes it is important that it makes the correct decision. For some particularly competitive courses the University operates a gathered field approach meaning that decisions may take longer than eight weeks; this will be communicated to applicants at the point of application.\nThe second schedule of the Statutes of the University allows for the Vice-Chancellor, with the concurrence of the Senate, to refuse to admit any person to the University without assigning a reason.\nApplicants who have received an offer of a place at Warwick may request that the offer be deferred to the intake after the one they were originally offered admission to.\nSuch requests will be considered by the Course Selector(s), and applicants should not presume that an offer of admission for one intake guarantees an offer for a future intake. The decision of the Course Selector is final.\nRequests to defer admission a second time will only be considered in very exceptional circumstances and where the applicant can demonstrate a compelling need to defer. Such requests will be considered by the Admissions Service Manager (Postgraduate) whose decision is final.\nApplicants with a disability and/or a specific learning difference are encouraged to apply to Warwick and are considered on the same academic grounds as all other candidates. Information regarding a disability and/or specific learning difference provided on the application form is not available to the Course Selector.\nShould the Course Selector recommend for an offer an applicant who has declared a disability and/or specific learning difference, Warwick’s Wellbeing Services staff will be informed in order for a parallel process to be initiated. Wellbeing Services staff may contact the applicant in order to discuss their requirements in advance of the course starting, and to consider what, if any, appropriate and reasonable adjustments might be required.\nApplicants with a disability and/or specific learning difference to courses which carry, upon successful completion, accredited status in a profession regulated by a Professional and Statutory Regulatory Body should additionally be aware of Warwick’s obligations in respect of Fitness to Practise. Further guidance, and a list of affected courses, may be found in Regulation 34.\nIt is an applicant’s responsibility to provide full and accurate information to the University by the relevant deadlines. Failure to do so may result in an application being made unsuccessful or an existing offer rescinded.\nUniversity regulation 6.3 (3) (b) provides for the consideration of information of a non‐academic nature that may affect an admissions decision. A Committee on the Admission of Students to Courses of Study may consider such information and advise the Vice‐Chancellor accordingly. Relevant information may include the declaration of a criminal conviction, activities outside of the law, fraudulent information or misrepresentation or, in the case of applications made to courses which carry, upon successful completion, accredited status in a profession regulated by a Professional and Statutory Regulatory Body Medicine, Teaching and Social Work applications, any issue that may represent an issue of fitness to practise. In these latter cases, a Fitness to Practise committee always considers the information first as provided for in Regulation 34. A list of affected courses may be found in Regulation 34.\nThe University may investigate cases disclosed to it under the UCAS Similarity Detection Service and reserves the right to refer any cases of concern to the Committee on the Admission of Students to Courses of Study. The University may contact the applicant for further information before finalising a decision.\nThe University reserves the right to withdraw any offer made on the basis of an application containing fraudulent or misleading information.\nWhere an applicant requires student entry clearance or leave to remain (a ‘visa’) to study in the UK, they are responsible for obtaining it and complying with its conditions. If an applicant does not have valid immigration permission for study purposes they will not be able to start their course.\nCandidates requiring a visa to study in the UK should be aware that an application to study at Warwick is separate to an application for sponsorship for visa purposes; an offer of a place to study is no guarantee of eligibility for a visa, which will be assessed at the point at which candidates request a Confirmation of Studies (CAS) from Warwick.\nIf an applicant requires a visa to study in the UK, failure to take up an accepted offer of a place, or withdrawal from your course after arrival, will affect your permission to come to or remain in the UK. In order to comply with the UK immigration regulations, Warwick is required to notify the immigration authorities, where relevant, of non-arrival and of any changes to your enrolment status.\nWhen an applicant who requires a visa to study in the UK agrees to the Terms and Conditions of offer, they are additionally confirming that they are not currently, nor have ever previously been, in the United Kingdom without valid immigration permission. If, at a later date, Warwick is informed that they have been in the United Kingdom without such valid permission it may be required to inform the immigration authorities and/or withdraw its 'sponsorship' of your application for leave.\nUK Visas and Immigration require that all international students that Warwick sponsors for student entry clearance must be deemed to be progressing academically from any previous studies undertaken in the UK. There are also caps on the total amount of time that international students may study in the UK. The University of Warwick will be unable to sponsor applicants for entry clearance if to do so would infringe either requirement. If, following the issuing of a CAS, the University determines that an applicant has given fraudulent or misleading information in their application, the CAS will be withdrawn.\nWarwick will provide feedback to candidates to whom it is not able to make an offer when this is requested by the candidate in writing either to the Postgraduate Admissions Service or to the relevant academic department.\nThe Postgraduate Admissions Service or academic department will respond to requests for feedback in a timely manner, although timescales may be longer at pressurised points in the admissions cycle. In cases where the request is received by the Postgraduate Admissions team, it may be necessary for the team to consult with the Course Selector before answering such a request.\nFeedback will normally include generic information to help applicants understand the means by which applicants are selected for the course to which they have applied, but a certain amount of specific information on an individual’s application may be available on request.\nThe University of Warwick treats the possibility of admissions fraud very seriously and our admissions team have expertise and experience in fraud detection.\nAll academic documents submitted by an applicant electronically are checked to ensure they are legitimate before an offer is confirmed. Once students arrive at Warwick, we select a sample of those electronically submitted documents and examine the original. The identity and legitimacy of all referees is also checked.\nUnfortunately, every year we detect applicants who have submitted fake or altered academic documents, fake references, or other false or misleading information.\nThe University takes robust action against applicants in such cases. If we find that fake documents or false information has been submitted, we will withdraw the application and any other applications made by the same person. If fraud is discovered after the individual has matriculated at the University, we are able to terminate their studies under Regulation 6. We will immediately withdraw any future application from an individual who has previously been found to have submitted false or misleading documentation or information.\nWhen investigating potential fraud, we may contact your previous awarding institution to verify your documentation.\nComplaints from applicants regarding the service they receive during the admissions process will be handled in accordance with the Admissions Service's Complaints Procedure.\nApplicants do not have the right to appeal against the academic judgement made on their application.\nUnder Statute 20(2) the Senate regulates the admission of persons to courses of study and the monitoring and reporting of admissions is via Senate committees, including the Steering Committee and the Academic Quality and Standards Committee (and its sub‐committees). An annual report is also presented to the Council. Detailed admissions information is published in the University’s Academic Statistics.\nEmail our Postgraduate Admissions Team\nIf you’re a UK or EU resident, there are no application deadlines for postgraduate taught courses. But places are limited, so you should submit your application as early as possible.\nSome applicants may need to obtain a student visa to study in the UK. For these applicants, the application deadline is 2 August 2025, to allow time to receive a CAS and complete the visa application process. Applicants who don’t need a visa do not have a deadline, however we recommend submitting your application as soon as possible to allow sufficient time for your application to be processed.\n[CARD]\nContacts\nEmail our Postgraduate Admissions Team\nApplication deadlines\nIf you’re a UK or EU resident, there are no application deadlines for postgraduate taught courses.

You'll then have the opportunity to choose between the Dissertation or Business in Practice route to complete your MSc year.\nOur innovative teaching delivery includes modules delivered via a '1+2' format, with a preparatory one-hour live online lecture equipping you with the relevant knowledge to best utilise each two-hour, face-to-face session.\nGain a conceptual grounding of the core principles of marketing, as well as an understanding of the marketing environment faced by managers.\nThis module aims to:\n\nProvide a conceptual grounding of the core principles of marketing as needs to be applied by a manager\nProvide a contextual understanding of the marketing environment faced by managers, and the practice of marketing appropriate to that environment\nAnalyse decision-making and managerial situations in the context of organisational objectives, and determine the best marketing approaches and plans suitable for the situation\nDevelop critical marketing thinking based on a sound understanding of the underlying logic of marketing and its interaction with other management disciplines.\n\nBy the end of the module you will be able to: \n\nDemonstrate an understanding of the organisational and strategic context within which marketing managers function\nDetermine the key elements of marketing plans to implement the marketing strategies\nDemonstrate an understanding of processes, their design and management\nDemonstrate an awareness of practical managerial issues in marketing management, as well as some generic solutions.\nThis module aims to:\nBy the end of the module you will be able to:\nLearn practical tools for managing the customer experience, and consider how service and value creation should be at the core of marketing activity.\nThe Western economies are essentially dominated by service-sector businesses, contributing about 70% of GDP, and their importance is growing in emerging economies. Furthermore, goods manufacturers increasingly seek to differentiate their offers through service as their products become commoditised. Emergent thinking in marketing is that the entire approach to the subject is flawed: that the ‘goods-dominant’ thinking of the manufacturing era - along with its accompanying economic theory - has biased the fundamental concepts and approaches have guided both marketing theory and practice. It is now argued that all businesses are, ultimately, service businesses and that marketing must revise many of its basic premises. We should not think of service as an add-on to products, but as the core of what we do and how we create value for customers. If service is central to value creation, service marketing cannot be separated from operations, HR and other functions. All need to combine in focusing on the customer experience.\nThis module challenges you by contrasting this new world-view to the traditional marketing view, presenting its intellectual origins in academic work on what is termed “service-dominant logic”, and discussing how it plays out in practice in many of the world’s blue-chips, particularly through the “customer experience management” movement.\nThe module outlines practical tools for managing the customer experience, and gives you practice in applying them to a range of businesses. These leading-edge tools represent a synthesis of what is regarded as best-practice in leading companies, according to recent research published by Warwick faculty, and what is advocated by scholars in the field.\nThe Western economies are essentially dominated by service-sector businesses, contributing about 70% of GDP, and their importance is growing in emerging economies.

While there is little controversy around the concept of branding and its importance, there is much less clarity around how exactly you create great brands. This module will address branding, and the diverse set of skills and understanding needed to utilise a brand to effectively drive revenue growth.\nAlongside this, this module will look at the trend of globalisation of markets. Arguing about the merits and demerits of globalisation is futile, because this is a force that continues to exert itself regardless of what an individual organisation or nation may want. It has become imperative, therefore, that for organisations to be successful, they need to acquire the ability to not only develop and sustain great brands, but also be able to do this in a global context.\nDeveloping successful global brands requires careful consideration of several criteria that specifically apply to a global and international context, including understanding the differences across different country-markets and cultures and the manner in which these are reflected in the brand programmes targeted to specific markets. Successful brand strategies require marketers to address the challenges not just of creating sustainable brands, but sustainable global brands. This module therefore also aims to provide an appreciation of the globalisation factors, and how these critically influence the dynamics of the successful creation of brands.\nOrganisations increasingly recognise that that one of the most valuable assets they possess is the brand associated with their products and services, and the organisation.

Whether looking to build a new plant, sell to a new market or find global business partners, exploiting opportunities in new markets or regions poses fresh challenges.\nMany of those challenges arise from the different business environment that's present in countries around the world. What does an understanding of economics tell us about which countries and regions will see markets develop quickly in the medium term? Which governments act in ways that pose macroeconomic risks and which do not? How can resources and intellectual property be managed effectively? Which economic theories offer strategies to foster talent and help staff respond to new opportunities?\nThe patterns of world trade and the responses of governments have always been in constant flux. Businesses can't rely on traditional markets in the medium- to long-term. The pandemic has disturbed even the recently-established patterns of global economic growth. Strategic business decisions require an appreciation of the economic thinking that underpins these new patterns of growth and the changes in international finance that support them.\nThis module will provide real world examples and case studies to illustrate how economic thinking helps businesses make the most of new opportunities, while managing the risks associated with expansion into new markets and regions.\nThe module has been developed for business and management students across the WBS MSc portfolio and draws on ideas and research from macroeconomics, microeconomics, international finance, business strategy and development economics.

Hence, the principal aim of this module is to challenge students' thinking about the appropriate and inappropriate use of customer data for strategic decision-making.\nBusinesses today have unprecedented access to information about their customers. However, many businesses fail to use this information to generate meaningful insights about the behaviour of their customers. The consequence is that these businesses fail to exploit opportunities for value creation, and improving their financial performance.\nThis module is inspired by the idea that 'It's not the size of the data, it's how you use it'. Hence, the principal aim of this module is to challenge your thinking about the appropriate and inappropriate use of customer data for strategic decision-making. Using real-world cases as context for data analyses, we will discuss good and bad practices for how to derive meaningful insights from data. Examples include comparing data for different groups of customers, finding clusters of customers, and how to analyse relationships between different types of customer data.\nYou'll not only improve their theoretical understanding of empirical methods, but will also learn how to apply these methods in the widely-used software R. Once these insights have been generated, it is also important to know how to use graphical representations of these insights for story-telling in business presentations. Accordingly, this module will also place great emphasis on good practices in the context of presentations with data.\nBusinesses today have unprecedented access to information about their customers.

Develop skills to help effective engagement in a world in which innovation and entrepreneurship are key drivers of change.\nThis module aims to develop an understanding of entrepreneurs and the firms they create and manage.\nThe module aims to develop an understanding of entrepreneurs and the firms they create and manage. Entrepreneurship is not only about new ventures or 'small' business or 'early-stage' business, nor even exclusively about for-profit business. Rather, it is a method of creative problem solving in business and a logic for taking action in a variety of settings where business can make a positive difference.

The trade conflict between the US and China, all the problems for global businesses (as well as the people of the UK and Europe) arising out of Brexit and the potential disruption to global supply chains for companies as diverse as car manufacturers and financial services. Furthermore, environmental crises and disruptions come in various forms: economic recessions, disease outbreaks, as well as terrorist attacks – many of which cannot be easily predicted and impose numerous non-trivial costs on firms, particularly MNEs due to their multimarket exposures. At the same time, MNEs are accused of behaving irresponsibly in their quest for global market growth, which is likely to impose further costs on these firms. \nBy the end of the module, you will be able to dig deep into these news headlines and gain real insight into the issues in order to discuss how MNEs can build sustainable business models in today’s global business environment.\nAnyone who follows the news will immediately understand the importance of global business and how it has become central to decisions made by governments and their regulators.

Firstly, the subject has its origins in large-scale, complex operations. This means that a large proportion of the published theory concerns the planning and control aspects of the management of such processes. Secondly, most of the concepts were developed in the heyday of the 1960s, where a lot of activity was taking place in the aerospace, defence and construction sectors. This means that most of the basic literature is reasonably old and technically focused.\nIn the modern context, project management methods are now used for a much wider variety of applications including change management, Third World development programmes and IT-based projects. As a consequence, this module aims to span a range of sectors and be as multi-disciplinary as possible. The planning and control aspects of the module occupy only about 20% of the total time available.\nYou will:\n\nDevelop an understanding of current project and programme management approaches and to make comparisons with your own organisation\nDevelop sensitivity to different project environments and to make comparisons and conclusions about them\nIncrease your understanding of commercial and behavioural issues in the management of projects\nProvide experience of handling project management problems in a simulation setting.\nThere are two specific features about project management theory which make it a slightly different type of subject to most other academic modules.

the tuition fees for my course?\nTuition fees are payable for each year of your course at the start of the academic year, or at the start of your course, if later. For details on how to pay your fees, please see our Making Payments pages.\nPlease note future years’ tuition fees will be set via the University’s fee setting process in due course. The tuition fee payable for each subsequent year of your programme will increase annually by the relevant inflation, which has ranged 4% to 6% in the last few years. The University will, usually in October of each year, publish on this webpage the tuition fees for a further academic year. You are advised to check the website for further details of any increases in tuition fees. If you have any queries in relation to tuition fees for future years that are not listed on the webpage, please contact email studentfees at warwick dot ac dot uk in the first instance.\nSome courses will require a tuition fee deposit, see the Tuition Fee Deposit page for more information.\nFrom 2020-21 students from the Channel Isles or the Isle of Man are charged at the Home rate.\nHow to find
