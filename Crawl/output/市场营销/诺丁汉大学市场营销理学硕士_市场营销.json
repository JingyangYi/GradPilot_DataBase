The tuition fee deposit is offset against the tuition fee when you register on your MSc course.\nIf you require a Student Visa to study in the UK this tuition fee deposit is separate and in addition to your £3,000 CAS (Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies) deposit.\nSecuring funding for postgraduate study (Masters or Doctorate) can be a complicated and competitive process. Follow the link below to investigate your funding options. It is important that when you start your course you have sufficient funds, or an achievable plan in place to obtain funds, to cover both your tuition fees and living costs.\nFunding for postgraduate students\nNottingham University Business School is pleased to announce scholarship funding for high-performing Masters applicants due to start in September 2025. Reaching up to 30% of the total fee, our scholarships aim to attract the most talented students from a wide range of academic backgrounds.Please be aware that funding is limited, therefore we strongly encourage you to apply for your MSc programme as soon as possible. Once funding limits have been met, we cannot issue further scholarships.Please note there is no separate application process for Business School scholarships - all those who receive an offer and have a strong 2:1 equivalent grade will automatically be considered. We are unfortunately unable to inform unsuccessful candidates due to the high volume of applications.Find out more about additional scholarship opportunities, including regional international Masters scholarships.\nWe offer a £5,000 alumni tuition fee scholarship for applicants who hold, or are due to receive, a University of Nottingham degree. If you are expected to graduate with a strong 2:1 in your Bachelors degree, you will be assessed for the Alumni Scholarship following receipt of your MSc course offer. You do not need to apply separately for this scholarship.\nPlease be aware that funding is limited, therefore we strongly encourage you to apply for your MSc programme as soon as possible. Once our funding limits have been met, we will not be able to issue further scholarships.\nThe university offers a wide range of scholarships and studentships for postgraduate students.\nBrowser does not support script.\nJubilee CampusNottingham\nNG8 1BB\nConnect with the University of Nottingham through social media and our blogs.\nCampus maps | More contact information | Jobs\n• UK\n• China\n• Malaysia\n• University of Nottingham\n• Who we are\n• Study\n• Research\n• Collaborate\n• People\n• Print\n• Who we are\n• Executive Education\n• Study with us\n\nUG\nMasters\n\n\nMasters fees and funding\n\nMBAPhDTeaching and learningStudent supportCase studiesCompany based challengeDigital professional skills\n• UG\n• Masters\n\n\nMasters fees and funding\n• Masters fees and funding\n• MBA\n• PhD\n• Teaching and learning\n• Student support\n• Case studies\n• Company based challenge\n• Digital professional skills\n• Open days\n• Research\n• Collaborate\n• News\n• People\n• Careers and employability\n• Alumni\n• Events\n• Blog\n• Connect with us\n• UG\n• Masters\n\n\nMasters fees and funding\n• Masters fees and funding\n• MBA\n• PhD\n• Teaching and learning\n• Student support\n• Case studies\n• Company based challenge\n• Digital professional skills\n• Masters fees and funding\n• Copyright\n• Terms and conditions\n• Privacy\n• Posting rules\n• Accessibility\n• Freedom of information\n• Charity gateway\n• Cookie policy\n• Cookie Settings",
