You’ll combine your skills and expertise in biotechnology with business and enterprise skills, developing an entrepreneurial mindset that can be applied to real-life biotechnology concepts.\nWhether it’s scaling up the production of an innovative new fuel source, or making wearable devices than can detect disease, entrepreneurship in biotechnology combines science and business, bringing potentially life-changing products to a commercial market. Along with a core module in biotechnology, you’ll study specific modules giving you a practical and theoretical understanding of initiating, financing, and managing entrepreneurial ventures:\nYou'll also take a unit focussing on the wider challenges of global environmental sustainability, giving you the opportunity to develop and use skills in teaching, media and communication, or public engagement.\nAs a key part of the course, you'll undertake two research projects:\nYou’ll graduate with the specialist skills and knowledge desired by industry, ready for a career in research or roles outside of academia in bioscience, agriculture or environmental industries. You'll also be suited for careers in non-lab settings such as legal, educational or entrepreneurial roles. Our dedicated careers team is on hand to offer individual guidance and help you choose between employment and further study.\nRecent graduate roles include: bioanalytical scientist, data consultant and life science conference producer.\nFind out more on maximising your employability while at Bath.\nThis course is for you if you’ve graduated from any bioscience, medical, veterinary or related discipline and you’re interested in specialising in a career using biotechnology in business.\nWe also offer the course with the option to specialise in sustainable biotechnologies or healthcare technologies and we have an MSc in Molecular Biosciences with specialisms offered in microbiology, bioinformatics and medical biosciences.\nBefore you apply for a course, please check the website for the most recently published course detail. If you apply to the University of Bath, you will be advised of any significant changes to the advertised programme, in accordance with our Terms and Conditions.\nWe understand that you will want to know more about the shape of the academic year. We work hard and plan for different scenarios, to be able to welcome you to the University of Bath at the start of each semester.\nOccasionally we make changes to our programmes in response to, for example, feedback from students, developments in research and the field of studies, and the requirements of accrediting bodies. You will be advised of any significant changes to the advertised programme, in accordance with our Terms and Conditions.\nIn addition to the units studied during the course, you'll have access to online study materials two weeks before the start of semester 1, to help you prepare for study at Bath.\nThese lists are to give you an idea of some, but not all, of the learning and assessment methods used on this course. They are not exhaustive lists and methods are subject to change.\nYou should expect to spend approximately 35 to 40 hours a week studying on your course. These hours consist of structured activities and independent learning.\nYou will experience a mix of in person teaching, that will take place on campus, and structured online learning delivered through the University’s virtual learning environment.\nMSc programmes deliver taught unit/modules in the first and second semester, with the Summer dedicated to a dissertation. The second semester will have less structured learning as you will start to prepare for your dissertation. Both during the dissertation preparation and the dissertation, supervision will take place at times suitable to you and your supervisor.\nTypically, you can expect to spend between 20 to 25  hours on structured learning activities per teaching week, of which approximately 60 to 80% will be in timetabled sessions on campus, and the remainder online. The hours of structured time are dependent on the optional units you decide to take, with more practical subjects normally having more structured time than more theoretical ones.\nTimetabled sessions delivered in person on campus will be a mix of lectures, seminars, tutorials, and laboratories. Online activities may include following a recorded lecture, or other learning materials, or joining a timetabled live interactive session through Microsoft Teams or Zoom.\nThe remainder of your time outside these structured activities will be spent in independent learning which includes individual research, reading journal articles and books, working on individual and group projects, preparing coursework assignments, presentations, or revising for exams.\nTo support you in your studies you will be able to access, outside of timetabled learning, facilities on campus and in Bath such as study spaces, computers, and the Library.\nAs well as being recognised as a higher academic qualification, a number of our degrees are also accredited by professional bodies in the United Kingdom.

They are not exhaustive lists and methods are subject to change.\nLearning and teaching\nOverall workload\nYou should expect to spend approximately 35 to 40 hours a week studying on your course. These hours consist of structured activities and independent learning.\nYou will experience a mix of in person teaching, that will take place on campus, and structured online learning delivered through the University’s virtual learning environment. \nStructured learning activities\nMSc programmes deliver taught unit/modules in the first and second semester, with the Summer dedicated to a dissertation. The second semester will have less structured learning as you will start to prepare for your dissertation. Both during the dissertation preparation and the dissertation, supervision will take place at times suitable to you and your supervisor.\nTypically, you can expect to spend between 20 to 25  hours on structured learning activities per teaching week, of which approximately 60 to 80% will be in timetabled sessions on campus, and the remainder online. The hours of structured time are dependent on the optional units you decide to take, with more practical subjects normally having more structured time than more theoretical ones. \nIn-person teaching and online activities\nTimetabled sessions delivered in person on campus will be a mix of lectures, seminars, tutorials, and laboratories. Online activities may include following a recorded lecture, or other learning materials, or joining a timetabled live interactive session through Microsoft Teams or Zoom.\nIndependent learning\nThe remainder of your time outside these structured activities will be spent in independent learning which includes individual research, reading journal articles and books, working on individual and group projects, preparing coursework assignments, presentations, or revising for exams. \nTo support you in your studies you will be able to access, outside of timetabled learning, facilities on campus and in Bath such as study spaces, computers, and the Library.\nLearning and teaching\nOverall workload\nYou should expect to spend approximately 35 to 40 hours a week studying on your course.
