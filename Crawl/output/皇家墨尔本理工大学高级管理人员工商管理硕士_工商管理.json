Learn more from Azlan about why studying business as a mature-age student is valuable here.\n[Start transcript]\nI'm Azlan. I'm currently a student at the Executive MBA program in RMIT.\nI actually  graduated Bachelor of Science and  Finance, went on to healthcare,  then precision engineering, LPG distribution,  project development. So I identify myself as  a project manager. Finally  decided to take up my EMBA.\nThe Executive MBA is more tailored to persons  with experience. I was actually petrified at  the fact that after 30 years to have to relearn  everything. The current education system is for you to be independent. You have things like Canvas  to support you, you have your RMIT Connect, but  essentially you are supposed to be independent.  Having four classes is like having four jobs.\nYour brain is torn into four different  directions all the time. Three of my  classes were in the EMBA program, and one of my classes was in the MBA program. The MBA program,  I meet up with my classmates every  week. They're a bit on the younger side,  but they are the ones who actually taught me  how to adapt. I've learned how to partition,  I've learned how to deal with things as they go.\nMy MBA lecturer, Dr. Ninh Nguyen, who was  teaching me sustainable business models,  and he helped me understand the subject matter  in great detail. Associate Professor March,  who teaches design thinking, he simplified  everything to the point that, you know,  an old fellow like me can understand the  concepts of design thinking. Simply it’s just to revamp your thought processes, in order  for you to embrace the new way of thinking. When you come to RMIT is an eye opener.  We will have to embrace this ideology because the rest of the world will start  to embrace it. That's why I chose RMIT.\n[End transcript]\nEMBA students often begin this degree with pre-conceptions about their careers, their capabilities and the jobs that await them.\nAs they become immersed in their study, they are introduced to new ways of thinking. They explore innovative problem-solving techniques, discover the strength of collaboration and are encouraged to think deeply and analytically about the global future. They undergo a transformation: they begin to develop the approaches of a 21st century senior business leader.\nThey cover the business essentials, while taking advantage of RMIT’s unique real-world focus and deep industry connections — solving real challenges and building a network of sustainable business connections that can lead to some interesting choices. After completing the capstone executive consulting subject, they step into the world of senior business management with a fresh, novel perspective on the world, and on the opportunities that exist for them.\nThis is why, when discussing their careers, alumni often say things like, “I never thought I’d be doing this,” or “When I enrolled in this degree, I never imagined the opportunities.”\nAs an RMIT student, you will develop the tools to design your own future. You will come to see the breadth of possibilities that exist in the world of senior business, and you will discover the leader in yourself.\nCourse accreditation or membership offered by professional bodies signals to employers the quality and relevance of RMIT's courses and opens up career pathways and networks.\nProfessional bodies accredit or recognise courses as meeting professional and academic standards deemed to be essential for a new graduate entering into that profession. An accredited course will either enable the graduate to enter directly into a professional qualifications program or provide the graduate with exemptions or credit towards a post-university professional qualification.\nThis type of accreditation is where a statutory body must approve a course of study in order for a graduate to practise in that profession.\nProfessional bodies or associations are representative organisations of professions that provide membership and other career development support to its members. Many professional bodies offer membership opportunities for students and new graduates with benefits such as career advice, networking within the profession and access to resources not available through the university. The aim of these benefits is to assist with your transition from university into the profession.\nCurrent course accreditations and information about membership and development opportunities for students and graduates.\nThe Executive Master of Business Administration course satisfies the quality and content standards defined by the EFMD program accreditation system recognising quality MBA programs.

I'm currently a student at the Executive MBA program in RMIT.\nI actually  graduated Bachelor of Science and  Finance, went on to healthcare,  then precision engineering, LPG distribution,  project development. So I identify myself as  a project manager. Finally  decided to take up my EMBA.\nThe Executive MBA is more tailored to persons  with experience. I was actually petrified at  the fact that after 30 years to have to relearn  everything. The current education system is for you to be independent. You have things like Canvas  to support you, you have your RMIT Connect, but  essentially you are supposed to be independent.  Having four classes is like having four jobs.\nYour brain is torn into four different  directions all the time. Three of my  classes were in the EMBA program, and one of my classes was in the MBA program. The MBA program,  I meet up with my classmates every  week. They're a bit on the younger side,  but they are the ones who actually taught me  how to adapt. I've learned how to partition,  I've learned how to deal with things as they go.\nMy MBA lecturer, Dr. Ninh Nguyen, who was  teaching me sustainable business models,  and he helped me understand the subject matter  in great detail. Associate Professor March,  who teaches design thinking, he simplified  everything to the point that, you know,  an old fellow like me can understand the  concepts of design thinking. Simply it’s just to revamp your thought processes, in order  for you to embrace the new way of thinking. When you come to RMIT is an eye opener.  We will have to embrace this ideology because the rest of the world will start  to embrace it. That's why I chose RMIT.\n[End transcript]\n\n\n\nBack to Video\nExpand all sections\nProfessional recognition and accreditation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse accreditation or membership offered by professional bodies signals to employers the quality and relevance of RMIT's courses and opens up career pathways and networks.\nProfessional bodies accredit or recognise courses as meeting professional and academic standards deemed to be essential for a new graduate entering into that profession.

I'm currently a student at the Executive MBA program in RMIT.\nI actually  graduated Bachelor of Science and  Finance, went on to healthcare,  then precision engineering, LPG distribution,  project development. So I identify myself as  a project manager. Finally  decided to take up my EMBA.\nThe Executive MBA is more tailored to persons  with experience. I was actually petrified at  the fact that after 30 years to have to relearn  everything. The current education system is for you to be independent. You have things like Canvas  to support you, you have your RMIT Connect, but  essentially you are supposed to be independent.  Having four classes is like having four jobs.\nYour brain is torn into four different  directions all the time. Three of my  classes were in the EMBA program, and one of my classes was in the MBA program. The MBA program,  I meet up with my classmates every  week. They're a bit on the younger side,  but they are the ones who actually taught me  how to adapt. I've learned how to partition,  I've learned how to deal with things as they go.\nMy MBA lecturer, Dr. Ninh Nguyen, who was  teaching me sustainable business models,  and he helped me understand the subject matter  in great detail. Associate Professor March,  who teaches design thinking, he simplified  everything to the point that, you know,  an old fellow like me can understand the  concepts of design thinking. Simply it’s just to revamp your thought processes, in order  for you to embrace the new way of thinking. When you come to RMIT is an eye opener.  We will have to embrace this ideology because the rest of the world will start  to embrace it. That's why I chose RMIT.\n[End transcript]\n\n\n\nBack to Video\nExpand all sections\nProfessional recognition and accreditation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse accreditation or membership offered by professional bodies signals to employers the quality and relevance of RMIT's courses and opens up career pathways and networks.\nProfessional bodies accredit or recognise courses as meeting professional and academic standards deemed to be essential for a new graduate entering into that profession.

information for international students\n• Frequently asked questions\n• The program and fees information applies to students commencing programs between 1 January and 31 December of the selected academic year.\n• All fees are quoted in Australian dollars ($AUD) and apply to RMIT University’s Australian campuses only.\n• Fees are held constant for each calendar year.\n• RMIT University may adjust program tuition fees at the beginning of each calendar year.\n• RMIT may increase the fees by no more than 7.5% each calendar year (subject to rounding). For Higher Education fees, tuition fees are rounded up to the nearest $10.00 per credit point increment, and so the actual fee increase may exceed 7.5%. Similarly, for VET/TAFE students the program annual fees are rounded to the nearest $250, and so the actual fee increase may exceed 7.5%.\n• Because fee increases are applied at the beginning of each calendar year, students commencing later in the year will find that the total cost of their program will be slightly higher than if they had commenced earlier in the year.\n• RMIT University Pathways (RMIT UP) student's fees are charged at a weekly rate.\n• Foundation Studies and Victorian Certificate of Education students are charged a flat semester fee.\n• News\n• Events\n• Library\n• Maps\n•

In addition, you will have access to online and digital resources such as lecture notes, assessment tools, discussion boards and podcasts.\nAssessment is ongoing throughout the semester and includes examinations, essays, reports, presentations, group projects, research projects and practical assignments. While group assignments are an important component of every subject, the focus of the assessment is weighted towards individual performance.\nThe types of classes you have will depend on the course you’re studying. Classes are offered in various formats designed to provide meaningful engagement with staff, industry and peers and provide for access and use of spaces where learning can be applied and active, including an array of specialised equipment.\nMost RMIT courses do not include passive large-scale classes such as lectures, instead the content traditionally provided in lectures is made available online. This may be in the form of readings, videos or other on-demand learning materials. This content will also support the basis of interactive learning that takes place in on-campus classes.\nThe world is constantly changing, and there are universal skills that can help you adapt to the evolving nature of work and global engagement.\nAs part of your study experience at RMIT, we provide 6 future-focused RMIT Capabilities:\nRMIT Capabilities are built into your course as well as some of our extracurricular experiences. They inform the design and delivery of your learning activities and assessments, so by the time you graduate, you’ll be ready to apply these capabilities in your life and work.\nThis course runs a successful professional development series, which connects RMIT’s industry partners with alumni and current students.\nThe purpose of these forums is to provide stakeholders with an opportunity to strengthen their networks and engage with prominent industry leaders on issues of current relevance.\nThe knowledge and skills you will acquire throughout this degree and how they can be applied in your career are described in the learning outcomes.\nThe Graduate Certificate in Business Administration (Executive) comprises four core subjects.\nIn addition to further developed skills in leadership, you will also have the opportunity to explore design thinking, marketing, and accounting for business decisions.\nChoose a plan below to find out more about the subjects you will study and the course structure.\nInternational student visa holders can only study full-time.\nYou are encouraged to progress to the Executive Master of Business Administration.\nGraduates of the arts, business, engineering, health, IT and many other fields may choose to study the Graduate Certificate or Master degree to broaden their career options.\nCourse accreditation or membership offered by professional bodies signals to employers the quality and relevance of RMIT's courses and opens up career pathways and networks.\nProfessional bodies accredit or recognise courses as meeting professional and academic standards deemed to be essential for a new graduate entering into that profession. An accredited course will either enable the graduate to enter directly into a professional qualifications program or provide the graduate with exemptions or credit towards a post-university professional qualification.\nThis type of accreditation is where a statutory body must approve a course of study in order for a graduate to practise in that profession.\nProfessional bodies or associations are representative organisations of professions that provide membership and other career development support to its members. Many professional bodies offer membership opportunities for students and new graduates with benefits such as career advice, networking within the profession and access to resources not available through the university.

You will find programs in our Study with us section.\nA final assessment will also be made by RMIT on receipt of your application and full supporting documentation.\nPlease note that where you have achieved more than one form of English language proficiency only the most recent achievement will be considered in the admission decision.\nYou must also meet the minimum academic requirements of your preferred program.\nStudy abroad and exchange students coming to Melbourne have their own English language requirements they should review.\nIf you are a citizen or permanent resident of Australia, a Temporary Protection visa (TPV) holder or a New Zealand citizen please see the English language requirements for local students.\nDon't meet the entry requirements? There is more than one way to get your degree of choice at RMIT.\nAsk about your study options at RMIT\nRMIT University acknowledges the people of the Woi wurrung and Boon wurrung language groups of the eastern Kulin Nation on whose unceded lands we conduct the business of the University.

In addition, you will have access to online and digital resources such as lecture notes, assessment tools, discussion boards and podcasts.\nAssessment is ongoing throughout the semester and includes examinations, essays, reports, presentations, group projects, research projects and practical assignments. While group assignments are an important component of every subject, the focus of the assessment is weighted towards individual performance.\nThe types of classes you have will depend on the course you’re studying. Classes are offered in various formats designed to provide meaningful engagement with staff, industry and peers and provide for access and use of spaces where learning can be applied and active, including an array of specialised equipment.\nMost RMIT courses do not include passive large-scale classes such as lectures, instead the content traditionally provided in lectures is made available online. This may be in the form of readings, videos or other on-demand learning materials. This content will also support the basis of interactive learning that takes place in on-campus classes.\nThe world is constantly changing, and there are universal skills that can help you adapt to the evolving nature of work and global engagement.\nAs part of your study experience at RMIT, we provide 6 future-focused RMIT Capabilities:\nRMIT Capabilities are built into your course as well as some of our extracurricular experiences.

An accredited course will either enable the graduate to enter directly into a professional qualifications program or provide the graduate with exemptions or credit towards a post-university professional qualification.\nThis type of accreditation is where a statutory body must approve a course of study in order for a graduate to practise in that profession.\nProfessional bodies or associations are representative organisations of professions that provide membership and other career development support to its members. Many professional bodies offer membership opportunities for students and new graduates with benefits such as career advice, networking within the profession and access to resources not available through the university.

It has formal assessment and may provide credit towards an award qualification. Microcredentials are a fast, practical way to upskill or reskill in the shortest possible time.\nBoth microcredentials and short courses focus on a specific topic area or skill set and are designed to meet the needs of learners, employers and industry.\nA short course does not contribute credit towards an award qualification and is not recorded on an academic transcript. Students who complete a short course are provided with an RMIT Certificate of Completion.\nThere are two key reasons employers value microcredentials – they demonstrate initiative, and provide concrete evidence that you’ve developed specific, transferable skills and knowledge.\nMicrocredential courses are the ideal supplement to your professional skills, helping you to stay abreast of developments within your industry. They’re also a great way to branch out, expand your knowledge base or dip your toe into a new field.\nRMIT University acknowledges the people of the Woi wurrung and Boon wurrung language groups of the eastern Kulin Nation on whose unceded lands we conduct the business of the University.

Our team will be in contact with you to guide you through the process.\nA single course at RMIT University is a subject from an undergraduate or postgraduate degree program. A single course gives you an opportunity to experience the subject matter before committing to a degree, up-skill in a specific area and experience University culture. Single courses are offered during RMIT University's Semester 1, Semester 2, Spring and Summer semesters. Enrolments are accepted only during official enrolment periods. Participants are issued with an RMIT University Academic Transcript upon completion.\nRMIT single courses are open to everyone aged 16 or over, excluding current RMIT students, students looking to do cross-institutional study and international students with limited study rights. If this is you there are alternative study options available that you can explore here.\nSome single courses may require a certain level of knowledge or prior study, therefore check for prerequisites before enrolling. Postgraduate subjects require you to hold a prior tertiary qualification that you will be asked to provide when you apply.\nIf a single course requires University approval, this means that there is an extra step in the application process. A statement outlining how you satisfy the entry requirements must be provided during the enrolment process, confirming that you satisfy the criteria or prerequisites necessary to undertake that particular single course.\nFor single courses that require University approval, we will contact you to advise of the decision. A payment needs to be made once your application has been approved, and only then is your enrolment confirmed. You will be issued with a single course tax invoice, which doubles as confirmation of your  enrolment. Please check this to ensure all details are correct, including your name, as it will appear as is on your academic transcript.\nThe following discounts are applicable to most of our single courses:\nRMIT Staff 25%\nRMIT Alumni 15%\nPlease contact us to determine if you are eligible for a discount. Discounts may not apply to all single courses. Proof must be provided at time of enrolment for a discount to be applied.

RMIT’s postgraduate courses give you the skills and connections you need.\nIf you want to change your career direction, advance to a management role, build on your skill set or create a valuable network of industry connections, a graduate certificate, graduate diploma or masters degree will give you the tools you need to lead what’s next. Some of our masters degrees and graduate qualifications have part-time study options available, which provides you with further flexibility to meet other commitments in your life.\nRMIT Open Day will open your mind. Join us on campus this August to get hands-on and experience how we're getting you ready for what's next.\nRMIT is ranked in the top 10 universities in all of Australia and in the top 125 universities globally*.\nRMIT’s courses are created with input from industry professionals to prepare students for what’s next.\nPostgraduate qualifications have higher salary outcomes than undergraduate qualifications^.\n*QS World University Ranking 2026\n ^QILT Graduate Outcomes Survey - Longitudinal 2023\nA graduate certificate is a short, focused course of study that is designed to help you gain specialised knowledge and skills in a particular area. They typically take about six months to a year to complete, depending on whether you study full-time or part-time. This makes them a flexible option for working professionals looking to advance their careers or explore new opportunities.\nA graduate diploma is designed to provide you with advanced knowledge and skills in a specific field, making it a great option if you want to deepen your expertise or shift your career focus. It offers more in-depth study than a graduate certificate but is shorter than a master's degree. Typically, a graduate diploma takes about one year of full-time study to complete, though part-time options are also available.\nA masters degree is an advanced postgraduate qualification that provides advanced specialist or professional training in a particular discipline or interdisciplinary area and can lead to professional accreditation. Some masters degrees also offer pathways to doctorate specialisations. It typically takes one to two years of full-time study to complete, though part-time options are also available.\nA PhD, or Doctor of Philosophy, is the highest level of academic qualification you can achieve. It involves conducting original research that contributes new knowledge to your field of study. A PhD typically takes three to four years of full-time study to complete, though part-time options are also available and may take longer.\nLearn key dates for submitting your application to study with RMIT.\nDiscover how RMIT postgrad student Floyd manages his work-life balance and the tips he has for new postgraduate students.\nMy name is Floyd. I study the Juris Doctor at RMIT.\nInitially, I studied a Bachelor of Arts majoring in International Studies at RMIT. I loved that degree, but when I finished, I wanted to study something more and I always had an interested in the law and that’s why I came to the JD at RMIT.\nI received offers from other universities, but having done my undergraduate degree at RMIT I knew that there were great facilities, great teaching and really strong industry connections, which is what I want to tap in to.\nI was initially apprehensive to return to study, however, the way the program is structured means we have flexible learning arrangements with online lectures and face-to-face classes, which means that you’re still able to have a healthy work and study balance whilst also maintaining a healthy social life. Working full time, the JD is great because it allows you to go to classes after work, with most classes starting from 5:30, which means you can fit in your full-time workload and also study on the side as well.\nJust because you work full-time, and study part-time doesn’t mean that you can’t have a healthy social life.\nA typical day when I have class involves me walking from my office near Southern Cross through the CBD to the RMIT campus. I’ve met lots of great friends, we often study together. It’s definitely a challenge working full-time and studying part-time, but with weekend classes and after-hours classes means that you can always find time between your work and study balance.\nOutside of the degree, I love music, I play the drums, I also like playing social sport with my friends, whether that be soccer or AFL and I also enjoy spending time at the football with my dad as well.\nOne thing I’ve learnt throughout my studies is that the knowledge that you learn in the lectures and the tutorials is really beneficial to your full-time job and it gives you really great transferable skills that you can use in your work to make you a better worker and I think it builds a bit of mental resilience studying part time, also working full time.\nTaking on the challenge of postgraduate studies will mean that I will graduate soon and be able to practice in a field that I’ve wanted to work in my whole life.\nStudents who are studying at another university or institution can apply to study at RMIT and may be eligible to receive credit for your previous study.\nYou may be eligible for credit for prior study and experience, including skills gained through employment, training, or life experience.\nScholarships are available for both local and international students and can help with all kinds of study costs such as textbooks, fees, accommodation and living expenses.\nRMIT University acknowledges the people of the Woi wurrung and Boon wurrung language groups of the eastern Kulin Nation on whose unceded lands we conduct the business of the University.

I’ve met lots of great friends, we often study together. It’s definitely a challenge working full-time and studying part-time, but with weekend classes and after-hours classes means that you can always find time between your work and study balance.\nOutside of the degree, I love music, I play the drums, I also like playing social sport with my friends, whether that be soccer or AFL and I also enjoy spending time at the football with my dad as well.\nOne thing I’ve learnt throughout my studies is that the knowledge that you learn in the lectures and the tutorials is really beneficial to your full-time job and it gives you really great transferable skills that you can use in your work to make you a better worker and I think it builds a bit of mental resilience studying part time, also working full time.\nTaking on the challenge of postgraduate studies will mean that I will graduate soon and be able to practice in a field that I’ve wanted to work in my whole life.\n\n\n\nBack to Video\nHow to balance work, life and study\nDiscover how RMIT postgrad student Floyd manages his work-life balance and the tips he has for new postgraduate students.\nHow to balance work, life and study\nDiscover how RMIT postgrad student Floyd manages his work-life balance and the tips he has for new postgraduate students.\nHow to balance work, life and study | Floyd - Postgraduate Student | RMIT University\nDiscover how RMIT postgrad student Floyd manages his work-life balance and the tips he has for new postgraduate students. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Transcript\n                        \n\n\n\n\nMy name is Floyd.

Working full time, the JD is great because it allows you to go to classes after work, with most classes starting from 5:30, which means you can fit in your full-time workload and also study on the side as well.\nJust because you work full-time, and study part-time doesn’t mean that you can’t have a healthy social life.\nA typical day when I have class involves me walking from my office near Southern Cross through the CBD to the RMIT campus. I’ve met lots of great friends, we often study together. It’s definitely a challenge working full-time and studying part-time, but with weekend classes and after-hours classes means that you can always find time between your work and study balance.\nOutside of the degree, I love music, I play the drums, I also like playing social sport with my friends, whether that be soccer or AFL and I also enjoy spending time at the football with my dad as well.\nOne thing I’ve learnt throughout my studies is that the knowledge that you learn in the lectures and the tutorials is really beneficial to your full-time job and it gives you really great transferable skills that you can use in your work to make you a better worker and I think it builds a bit of mental resilience studying part time, also working full time.\nTaking on the challenge of postgraduate studies will mean that I will graduate soon and be able to practice in a field that I’ve wanted to work in my whole life.\n\n\n\nBack to Video\nHow to balance work, life and study\nDiscover how RMIT postgrad student Floyd manages his work-life balance and the tips he has for new postgraduate students.\nHow to balance work, life and study\nDiscover how RMIT postgrad student Floyd manages his work-life balance and the tips he has for new postgraduate students.\nHow to balance work, life and study | Floyd - Postgraduate Student | RMIT University\nDiscover how RMIT postgrad student Floyd manages his work-life balance and the tips he has for new postgraduate students. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Transcript\n                        \n\n\n\n\nMy name is Floyd.

For the last couple of years my independence has definitely increased and despite it being such a huge student population, there’s still very much the community aspect of RMIT. Whether that’s through your classes, through your clubs that you may join, through your friendship groups. It’s still very much a feeling of belonging.\nDuring school I was very sort of interested in the sciences and maths and I’ve always been a tinkerer at heart, pulling things apart and putting them back together, understanding how they work. So, for me civil engineering was the logical step.\nBeing on campus, some of the best spots I found were in Building 80. You’ve got outlooks over the city, Melbourne is very easily accessible, as is the city campus. Public transport and some of the things that I’ve become very accustomed to include, you know, coffee at the local café and a chocolate croissant or a banh mi at the local Vietnamese place. That’s something that I had never experienced before I got down to Melbourne.\nOne of my highlights was a steel class where we designed throughout the semester an I-beam varying a few of the different properties and dimensions of the I-beam before going out to the Bundoora campus and testing the beam and seeing if the load that it failed at was actually concurrent with our calculations, which I found to be a very hands on, real world application of what we were learning.\nI found the civil engineering course and associated clubs, CESA, being the Civil Engineering Students Association, to be very valuable in providing industry events. Regularly we would receive emails about job opportunities or networking opportunities. Currently I’m working for a company out on North East Link, one of the big tunnel projects in Melbourne as an undergraduate engineer and I’ve been offered a graduate engineering role there, which I will commence after I graduate. Some of the RMIT support services on offer that I used include RMIT Career Centre, which is where I found my current job advertised. I found a lot of civil engineering professors to be very dedicated to their students, always there to answer questions whether it’s after class or later in the evening as assignments are due.\nI’m very much looking forward to graduation day, with the graduation parade around the city campus in the morning. I’ve got family coming down from Wagga up in NSW to celebrate with me, so my mum, my dad, my aunty and uncle are going to come down. My partner’s going to come as well, so we will go out and celebrate after.\nThe main thing I’ve learned in my four years at RMIT is the importance of rounding out your education. Not just having good grades but getting amongst student clubs and getting an internship and using those industry connection has. In 10 years’ time I hope to be working on some major projects. With an RMIT Civil Engineering degree, I’m certain that it’ll hold me in good stead if I want to pursue engineering opportunities overseas or around Australia. It’s a very well recognised degree and I think the skills that I’ve gotten at RMIT and the skills I hope to gain in the workforce will hold me in good stead to achieve those things in 10 years’ time.\nSee our step-by-step guides and learn about important dates and any supporting documentation you may need for your application.\nRMIT’s applications are always open for international students - you can apply to RMIT as an international student any time of year.\nHaving second thoughts about where you are currently? Transfer to study at RMIT and you may be eligible to receive credit for your previous study.\nDon’t quite meet the entry requirements? Start with a certificate or diploma instead, then transfer into your dream degree.\nFind out everything you need to know about applying to RMIT as an international student, including entry requirements, pathways, scholarships and more.\nIs your teen preparing for their first year of uni? Here's everything you need to know about studying at RMIT.\nScholarships are available for both local and international students and can help with all kinds of study costs such as textbooks, fees, accommodation and living expenses.\nYou may be eligible for credit for prior study and experience, including skills gained through employment, training, or life experience.\nHave more questions?\nOur friendly staff at Study@RMIT are available five days a week to assist you.\nIf you are a current RMIT student, please contact RMIT Student Connect.\nRMIT University acknowledges the people of the Woi wurrung and Boon wurrung language groups of the eastern Kulin Nation on whose unceded lands we conduct the business of the University.

For the last couple of years my independence has definitely increased and despite it being such a huge student population, there’s still very much the community aspect of RMIT. Whether that’s through your classes, through your clubs that you may join, through your friendship groups. It’s still very much a feeling of belonging.\nDuring school I was very sort of interested in the sciences and maths and I’ve always been a tinkerer at heart, pulling things apart and putting them back together, understanding how they work. So, for me civil engineering was the logical step. \nBeing on campus, some of the best spots I found were in Building 80. You’ve got outlooks over the city, Melbourne is very easily accessible, as is the city campus. Public transport and some of the things that I’ve become very accustomed to include, you know, coffee at the local café and a chocolate croissant or a banh mi at the local Vietnamese place. That’s something that I had never experienced before I got down to Melbourne.\nOne of my highlights was a steel class where we designed throughout the semester an I-beam varying a few of the different properties and dimensions of the I-beam before going out to the Bundoora campus and testing the beam and seeing if the load that it failed at was actually concurrent with our calculations, which I found to be a very hands on, real world application of what we were learning.\nI found the civil engineering course and associated clubs, CESA, being the Civil Engineering Students Association, to be very valuable in providing industry events. Regularly we would receive emails about job opportunities or networking opportunities. Currently I’m working for a company out on North East Link, one of the big tunnel projects in Melbourne as an undergraduate engineer and I’ve been offered a graduate engineering role there, which I will commence after I graduate. Some of the RMIT support services on offer that I used include RMIT Career Centre, which is where I found my current job advertised. I found a lot of civil engineering professors to be very dedicated to their students, always there to answer questions whether it’s after class or later in the evening as assignments are due. \nI’m very much looking forward to graduation day, with the graduation parade around the city campus in the morning. I’ve got family coming down from Wagga up in NSW to celebrate with me, so my mum, my dad, my aunty and uncle are going to come down. My partner’s going to come as well, so we will go out and celebrate after. \nThe main thing I’ve learned in my four years at RMIT is the importance of rounding out your education. Not just having good grades but getting amongst student clubs and getting an internship and using those industry connection has. In 10 years’ time I hope to be working on some major projects. With an RMIT Civil Engineering degree, I’m certain that it’ll hold me in good stead if I want to pursue engineering opportunities overseas or around Australia. It’s a very well recognised degree and I think the skills that I’ve gotten at RMIT and the skills I hope to gain in the workforce will hold me in good stead to achieve those things in 10 years’ time. \n\n\n\nBack to Video\nFor domestic students\nSee our step-by-step guides and learn about important dates and any supporting documentation you may need for your application.\n\n\n\n\n                                            Learn more\nFor domestic students\nSee our step-by-step guides and learn about important dates and any supporting documentation you may need for your application.\n\n\n\n\n                                            Learn more\nSee our step-by-step guides and learn about important dates and any supporting documentation you may need for your application.\nFor international students\nRMIT’s applications are always open for international students - you can apply to RMIT as an international student any time of year.\n\n\n\n\n                                            Learn more\nFor international students\nRMIT’s applications are always open for international students - you can apply to RMIT as an international student any time of year.\n\n\n\n\n                                            Learn more\nRMIT’s applications are always open for international students - you can apply to RMIT as an international student any time of year.\nTransfers\nHaving second thoughts about where you are currently?
