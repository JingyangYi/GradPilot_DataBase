And how can we translate insights about neural systems into usable technologies?\nThese are key questions for the future success of medical sciences and for the development of artificial intelligent systems. Answering these questions requires expertise that extends across multiple academic disciplines.\nTo approach these questions, researchers must work at the interface between physics and medical sciences, engineering and cognitive sciences, mathematics and computer science.\n• Program\n• Admission\n• About\n• Goals\n• Research\n• FAQ",

Students may choose, in consultation with their mentor, a selection of elective core modules and elective modules to suit their backgrounds and goals. The Master’s thesis is mandatory and students have the option to reduce the duration of the thesis project in favor of two short research projects.\nThe core modules provide a common foundation for students with different educational backgrounds and are mandatory for all NSC students. The set of elective core modules cover the following:\nStudents must attend core modules from at least two of the three above listed disciplines (see Credit Point System).\nIn addition to theoretical courses, the core modules include a practical education in instrumentation, measurement, and data analysis relevant to neuroinformatics as well as an opportunity to study, discuss, and report on a list of foundational research papers in neuroscience and computation. In addition, a journal club, held with graduate students and INI staff, will provide a forum for the analysis and evaluation of recently published high-profile research. The journal club provides a state-of-art awareness of progress in the field.\nA learning agreement must be signed by both the student and his/her mentor at the start of the studies (first semester). This is mandatory for students who started in the Spring 2019 or later, and optional for those who started earlier. Please provide the NSC administration with the signed agreement in the first semester. The learning agreement form can be found under Documents.\nThe program is affiliated with the Faculty of Science (MNF) at the University of Zurich (UZH) and the Information Technology and Electrical Engineering Department (D-ITET) of the ETH Zurich.\nSince 2011, students are awarded a Joint Master Degree UZH/ETHZ. The leading house of this Joint Master is the University of Zurich, regulations are according to guidelines of the University of Zurich.\nCredit Point System\nCore Modules\nElective Core Modules\nElective Modules\nMSc Thesis and Exam\n• Systems Neurosciences\n• Neural Computation and Theoretical Neurosciences\n• Neurotechnologies and Neuromorphic Engineering\n• Credit Point System\n• Core Modules\n• Elective Core Modules\n• Elective Modules\n• MSc Thesis and Exam\n• Documents\n[CARD]\nSubpages of  Program\nSubpages of  Program\r\n          \n\n\n\nCredit Point System\r\n                               \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCore Modules\r\n                               \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElective Core Modules\r\n                               \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElective Modules\r\n                               \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMSc Thesis and Exam\r\n                               \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocuments",

      "content": "[HEADING] Admission\nWe offer a specialized full-time Master’s degree program to bachelor  students with a background in any of the following disciplines: neurosciences, information technology, electrical engineering, biology, physics, computer sciences, chemistry, mathematics, biomedicine, mechanical/chemical/control engineering, or similar subjects.\nWomen in particular are encouraged to apply.\nPlease follow the procedure below and take note of the following registration deadlines:\nFall Semester: By December 31st of the previous year\nSpring Semester: By July 31st of the previous year\nPlease note that these application deadlines are specific to the NSC Master’s program. They are different from the semester application dates for University of Zurich and ETH Zurich. Your application will only be evaluated after the respective deadline (Dec 31 or Jul 31) and it will take 2-3 months before you receive a response. No new applications after the deadline will be accepted. Due to the number of applications we are unable to provide any feedback about the chances to be accepted.\nNote that there is no formal language requirement necessary for the application. Your english skills will be evaluated during an interview, if your application makes it through the first round of selection. Note also that GRE scores or equivalent are not necessary. For financial information (tuition etc), see our FAQ (link below).\nTHE APPLICATION PROCESS INVOLVES THE FOLLOWING TWO STEPS:\n(1) Submit the electronic application form (below) which requires the following documents:\ncurriculum vitae (resume)\na max. one-page motivation letter stating the reasons for your interest in this program\nfull details about your Bachelor’s degree including the complete transcript of academic records\nfor non Swiss citizens: A short financial statement describing how you plan to cover your living expenses in Switzerland while enrolled in the program (no bank details needed)\nIn this application form you are required to provide the following information:\nNames of the preferred and second-preferred mentor from the list below (the role of the mentor is to help you plan a personal curriculum; you do not need to contact the mentors before submitting your application). Find more about the mentors here.\nTwo reference contacts; name, position, phone, e-mail. You do not need to submit reference letters, only the contact information. After a first selection process, we will contact the references of the students still being considered. This might happen up to 8-10 weeks after the application deadline. We will not answer queries concerning our communication with the references.\nFor further frequently asked questions please see our FAQ page.\n(2) The evaluation process will take about 2-3 months, starting with the respective application deadline (31 December or 31 July of the previous year). As soon as you will have received a positive recommendation for the University Zurich, the UZH admission office will get in touch with you for the formal part. Please note that the UZH admission office will ask you again for most of the documents. It is important to realize that the NSC program can only recommend you for admission. The final decision is taken by the UZH admission office. You are formally not officially accepted until you get the final decision from the admission office.\nStart application process\nAdditional Information\nAdmission is only possible with a Bachelor degree from a Swiss university, or from a foreign university having a world ranking within the top 1000.\nIf your Bachelor’s degree is from an University of Applied Sciences in relevant disciplines, or with a Bachelor’s degree in a non-relevant discipline (i.e. as listed above), an average grade within the top 20% of your university's scoring system is required. Admitted students may need to complete additional coursework in the fields of neuroscience, physics, computer science, engineering, or biology. This will be decided by the Dean's office and the admission committee on a case-by-case basis.  Applicants who already have an Msc degree in a related field (engineering, neurobiology, biomedicine etc) will not be accepted into this program.\nFinancial support for foreign students\nIt is your responsibility to secure your own financial support. There are currently no fellowships offered by the University or the Swiss State for foreign MSc students. You can find some information about fellowships offered by other countries for studies in Switzerland on our FAQ page.\nFind more information about financial support at University of Zurich Student Financial Aid Office.\n• Fall Semester: By December 31st of the previous year\n• Spring Semester: By July 31st of the previous year\n• curriculum vitae (resume)\n• a max. one-page motivation letter stating the reasons for your interest in this program\n• full details about your Bachelor’s degree including the complete transcript of academic records\n• for non Swiss citizens: A short financial statement describing how you plan to cover your living expenses in Switzerland while enrolled in the program (no bank details needed)\n• Names of the preferred and second-preferred mentor from the list below (the role of the mentor is to help you plan a personal curriculum; you do not need to contact the mentors before submitting your application).
