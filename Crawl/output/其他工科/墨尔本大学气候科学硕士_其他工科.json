The more we know, the better our solutions will be. But – do we understand how our climate system works?The Master of Climate Science is a science-focused degree and builds specialist knowledge in physical climate science, climate change science, climate modelling skills, climate model output analysis techniques, and climate policy. Understanding how the climate system works – and applying that knowledge to address climate change impacts – will allow you to shape how our cities, workplaces and lifestyles can adapt.\nYou’ll have the skills to work in the expanding fields of climate risk, environmental consulting, climate science, or transfer your climate knowledge towards new industries yet to be unearthed. Whether you want to be a part of the latest industry endeavours or research the next scientific breakthrough, this degree teaches you the necessary climate science knowledge to make a difference.\nWith a flexible approach to choosing your subjects, you can focus on climate policy or deepen your knowledge of physical climate science. Complete an internship subject and build your professional skills development alongside top climate scientists, including lead authors from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Or take your studies further with graduate research, delivering insights that will help inform climate change solutions for the coming century.\nThe Master of Climate Science is part of the Office for Environmental Programs (OEP), which has 20 years of excellence in environment and sustainability. You’ll be taught and mentored by world-leading academics in climate change science, connect with research projects across the university or network with our industry partners. There are opportunities both in Australia and abroad.\nContact-support \n    How can we help?\n• Arrow-right  \n          #24\n         \n          in the world for Environmental Sciences\n• Course code:\n         MC-CLIMSCI\n• Biological sciences\n• Conservation\n• Earth and environmental sciences\n• Environment\n• Environmental law, policy and sustainability\n• Science\n[GRID_TABLE]\nArrow-right  \n        How to apply\nArrow-right  \n        Enquire\nArrow-right  \n        Register for updates\n[GRID_TABLE]\nBiological sciences\nConservation\nEarth and environmental sciences\nEnvironment\nEnvironmental law, policy and sustainability\nScience\n[CARD]\nArrow-right  \n        Register for updates\n[CARD]\nArrow-right  \n        How to apply\n[CARD]\nArrow-right  \n        Enquire\n[CARD]\nBiological sciences\n[CARD]\nBiological sciences\n[CARD]\nConservation\n[CARD]\nConservation\n[CARD]\nEarth and environmental sciences\n[CARD]\nEnvironment\n[CARD]\nEnvironment\n[CARD]\nEnvironmental law, policy and sustainability\n[CARD]\nScience\n[CARD]\nScience",

Work as a climate scientist in the growing fields of climate risk and environmental consulting, or combine your learnings and apply climate knowledge to a broad range of occupations.\nWork in areas relevant to climate science is diverse. Here are some examples of roles you could find yourself employed in following graduation:\nYour future job title could include:\nThe Master of Climate Science and the University of Melbourne are connected with organisations such as:\nIf you’re looking for experience with research, you’ll be able to connect with research projects like:\n\"What drew me to this program was the perfect blend of my passion for the natural world and my analytical mindset. Climate science is such a dynamic field―it bridges environmental challenges with cutting-edge scientific research, and that’s exactly what I was looking for.\nOne of the best parts of studying at the University of Melbourne has been the access to world-class facilities and experts in the field. The lectures, especially in my master’s, are taught by leading researchers whose work is shaping global climate policies. Beyond academics, I’ve loved the connections I’ve made―both with fellow students, who bring diverse perspectives, and with professors who are always supportive and inspiring.\nWhat’s great about this program is that you don’t need a specific background in climate science to thrive. My cohort includes people from physics, geography, and even economics―each bringing unique skills to the table. My own background was in mathematics and environmental studies, and I’ve found that the program helps you build on your strengths while filling in the gaps.

This applies even if you're studying abroad or have dual Australian citizenship.\nTo be considered for entry into this course, you must have:\nDisciplines relevant to this course may include physics, chemistry, mathematics, computer science, engineering, environmental science, or equivalents.\nMeeting the published entry requirements for this course does not guarantee selection.\nWhere our admission criteria includes a minimum Weighted Average Mark (WAM) and/or specific subject criteria, these are based on University of Melbourne grades and subjects. If you've studied elsewhere, we'll assess your relevant prior studies and equivalent grades. Your final WAM may be adjusted depending on your previous institution's accreditation, subject grading, and pass marks.\nYou may have the option to enrol in specific single subjects through the University's Community Access Program, even if you are not enrolled in a course. Completing these prerequisite subjects may qualify you for entry into this course. This option is not available to student visa holders or applicants. Learn more about single subject study.\nYou can use our graduate coursework grade conversion eligibility calculator to get an indication of whether you are eligible for this course based on your previous studies and Weighted Average Mark (WAM).\nAll applicants to the University of Melbourne must satisfy the English language requirements. This may be achieved in a number of ways, including recognised previous study taught and assessed entirely in English or an approved English language test. If you are from a non-English speaking background, the required standard of English for this degree is one of the following English proficiency test scores:\nIf you need to undertake an English language test, you must meet one of the scores* below:\nWhen assessing applications, the Selection Committee will consider your previous studies and academic performance.\nThe Selection Committee may request additional information to clarify any aspect of an application, according to the University’s Academic Board rules regarding selection instruments.\nIf you do not meet the prerequisite subject requirements, you have the option to undertake an approved single subject via Coursera Online.\nThe below-listed course is approved to satisfy the prerequisite requirements for the Master of Climate Science.\nYou must undertake the course as Certificate Mode.\nMAST10005 Calculus 1:\nThese subjects may not be approved to meet the same prerequisite requirements for other courses at the University, please refer to the study page for information relevant to other courses.\nWe encourage domestic students to explore eligibility for Graduate Access Melbourne (GAM). GAM offers an opportunity for admission to this course even if your tertiary marks are below the standard entry requirements. GAM applicants may also be considered for financial bursaries and Commonwealth Supported Places (CSPs) where available.\nGAM categories include coming from a rural area, being an Indigenous Australian, experiencing financial hardship or personal difficulties, having refugee status, or living with a disability or medical condition. In assessing applications, we look to balance opportunity and your capacity to succeed.\nPrior studies may be credited towards your degree and potentially reduce the duration of your course.
