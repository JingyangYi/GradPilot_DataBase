After that the programme has no formal specialisations. This allows students to, in consultation with the study advisor, tailor their programme to fit their own interests, wishes and needs. They can do that that by:\nThe course work consists of several compulsory subjects, restricted optional subjects and optional subjects. As an optional subject you can choose any relevant master course offered at Wageningen University or another academic institution. The courses provide you with the knowledge and skills you need for your thesis research, academic internship and future career.\nRead more about the courses\nAt the end of the first year, you learn how to properly use GIS- and Remote Sensing concepts, methods and data when contributing to a geo-spatial project. In a team of 5 or 6 students with a multidisciplinary and multicultural background, you will execute a project in the geo-spatial domain for an external client. The project includes fieldwork, excursions, analysing and reporting, and requires synthesising knowledge from different disciplines. The project is evaluated in terms of process, applied research methods, synthesis of the compiled information, and the resulting advice to the client.\nYou end your personal Geo-information Science profile by completing a thesis research in one of the following fields:\nThe Geo-Information Science major thesis research consists of 26 credits of research conducted under supervision of a staff member of the Laboratory of Geo-Information Science and Remote Sensing (GRS group). It is also possible to complete the major thesis at another Wageningen University Chair Group,  an external institute or company.\nYou choose your research subject in consultation with the thesis coordinator. The subject usually originates from topics proposed by the GRS group, however the subject chosen must reflect your own research interest.\nDuring the research period you work on and write your thesis. This is graded by an examining committee including at least one independent internal or external examiner. You are also required to present your results during a seminar, the ‘colloquium’.\n• Content\n• Search box\n• Breadcrumb\n• selecting advanced geo-information and remote sensing courses;\n• selecting geo data science oriented courses;\n• selecting advanced courses in their original or new domains;\n• choosing specific topics in the academic consultancy training part of the Remote Sensing and GIS integration course; and\n• selecting specific thesis subjects and internship locations.\n• Sensing & Measuring\n• Modelling & Visualisation\n• Integrated Land Monitoring\n• Human-space Interaction\n• Empowering & Engaging Communities",

      "content": "[HEADING] Compare the programme in Wageningen\n[HEADING] Compare the programme with other students\nThe master's Geo-Information Science combines expertise in the domains of ICT, geo-sciences, environmental sciences and social sciences. The programme consists of courses based on GIS and remote sensing methods and techniques, as well as courses in geo-information processing. These include data gathering, data analysis and data presentation. You learn to use geo-information systems and remote sensing techniques to find solutions for spatial problems within relevant fields of the environmental sciences.\nYou can choose to include certain elements of the master's Geo-Information Science in other master's study programmes at Wageningen University. However, Geo-Information does not form an integral part of any other master's study programme which makes the master's Geo-Information Science unique within Wageningen University.\nThe master's Geographical Information Management and Applications (GIMA) is a cooperation between Utrecht University, Wageningen University, Delft University of Technology and the University of Twente. This is primarily a distance learning study programme, and can be followed part time. The programme's focus is on management and development of geo-information applications and projects. GIS can also be a part of study programmes like Human Geography, Earth Science, ICT, Environmental Sciences and Biology.\nThe master's Geomatics (Delft University of Technology) primarily focuses on technical applications in the built environment.\nThe master track Geoscience and remote sensing of the MSc Applied Earth Sciences (Delft University of Technology) combines the fields of earth sciences with GIS and remote sensing. This track includes courses on physics of the earth and atmosphere, geodesy and remote sensing, geo-data processing and analysis, and climate change.\nThe master Geo-information Science and Earth Observation (University of Twente) has also an interdisciplinary approach. This programme has a variety of specialisations covering several fields.\nThe Wageningen Geo-Information Science programme is broader in scope and allows you to focus on finding solutions to complex challenges in the green domain and in developing applications in areas like spatial planning, nature- and landscape management, sustainable agriculture and water management. The distinctive features of the Geo-Information Science master are the combination of aspects from different domains. Thus, you are offered a broad choice to deepen your knowledge of certain domains, depending on your background and interests.\nBy following the master Geo-Information Science you will gain skills and understanding in the field of GI, RS and data management; making you an expert with a bright future ahead.\n• Content\n• Search box\n• Breadcrumb",
