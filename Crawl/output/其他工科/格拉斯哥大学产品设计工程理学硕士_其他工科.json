Students have access to state-of-the-art product design engineering prototyping and manufacturing processes in the PDE workshops at GSA and University of Glasgow.There are increasing pressures, from both existing and emerging world marketplaces, for products which not only respond to the needs of function, user and society, but which can be brought to market ever more rapidly through state-of-the-art development and manufacturing processes. Industries which develop, manufacture and market today's products need high-caliber graduates equipped to handle these processes with management skill and creative drive, and this programme develops graduates with these skills.\nThe studio programme explores cultural, management, perceptual, process and psychological issues, offering a curriculum relevant to the needs of industry and an understanding of the role of the design engineer in society.\nThe MSc Product Design Engineering is accredited in the “Further Learning” category accredited the Institution of Engineering Designers (IED). This means that a student with an accredited BEng undergraduate degree can take the accredited \"Further Learning\" MSc to top-up their academic qualifications in order to meet the full academic requirements for conferral of the title of Chartered Engineer. This is an alternative route to the 5-year undergraduate MEng route.\nThe programme is accredited by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.\nThe University of Glasgow has been delivering world-class engineering education and research since 1840.\nThe School of Engineering has an Athena Swan Silver Award, demonstrating the school’s commitment to supporting women in scientific studies and careers, and to improving the working environment for all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgramme structure\nYou will attend lectures, seminars and tutorials and take part in lab, project, team and studio work, industrial visits, and workshops.\nCore courses\n\nMicroelectronics in Consumer Products 4\nAdvanced Manufacture\nCore Research Skills for Design\nPDE Introduction Project M\nGSA Elective M\nPDE Human Factors M\nIntegrated Engineering Design\n\nOptional courses\n\nAdvanced Programming and Software Engineering 3\nFault Detection, Isolation And Recovery\nInstrumentation and Data Systems 3\n\n\nProgramme alteration or discontinuationThe University of Glasgow endeavours \n                            to run all programmes as advertised.

Students have access to state-of-the-art product design engineering prototyping and manufacturing processes in the PDE workshops at GSA and University of Glasgow.There are increasing pressures, from both existing and emerging world marketplaces, for products which not only respond to the needs of function, user and society, but which can be brought to market ever more rapidly through state-of-the-art development and manufacturing processes. Industries which develop, manufacture and market today's products need high-caliber graduates equipped to handle these processes with management skill and creative drive, and this programme develops graduates with these skills.\nThe studio programme explores cultural, management, perceptual, process and psychological issues, offering a curriculum relevant to the needs of industry and an understanding of the role of the design engineer in society.\nThe MSc Product Design Engineering is accredited in the “Further Learning” category accredited the Institution of Engineering Designers (IED). This means that a student with an accredited BEng undergraduate degree can take the accredited \"Further Learning\" MSc to top-up their academic qualifications in order to meet the full academic requirements for conferral of the title of Chartered Engineer. This is an alternative route to the 5-year undergraduate MEng route.\nThe programme is accredited by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.\nThe University of Glasgow has been delivering world-class engineering education and research since 1840.\nThe School of Engineering has an Athena Swan Silver Award, demonstrating the school’s commitment to supporting women in scientific studies and careers, and to improving the working environment for all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgramme structure\nYou will attend lectures, seminars and tutorials and take part in lab, project, team and studio work, industrial visits, and workshops.\nCore courses\n\nMicroelectronics in Consumer Products 4\nAdvanced Manufacture\nCore Research Skills for Design\nPDE Introduction Project M\nGSA Elective M\nPDE Human Factors M\nIntegrated Engineering Design\n\nOptional courses\n\nAdvanced Programming and Software Engineering 3\nFault Detection, Isolation And Recovery\nInstrumentation and Data Systems 3\n\n\nProgramme alteration or discontinuationThe University of Glasgow endeavours \n                            to run all programmes as advertised.

Students have access to state-of-the-art product design engineering prototyping and manufacturing processes in the PDE workshops at GSA and University of Glasgow.There are increasing pressures, from both existing and emerging world marketplaces, for products which not only respond to the needs of function, user and society, but which can be brought to market ever more rapidly through state-of-the-art development and manufacturing processes. Industries which develop, manufacture and market today's products need high-caliber graduates equipped to handle these processes with management skill and creative drive, and this programme develops graduates with these skills.\nThe studio programme explores cultural, management, perceptual, process and psychological issues, offering a curriculum relevant to the needs of industry and an understanding of the role of the design engineer in society.\nThe MSc Product Design Engineering is accredited in the “Further Learning” category accredited the Institution of Engineering Designers (IED). This means that a student with an accredited BEng undergraduate degree can take the accredited \"Further Learning\" MSc to top-up their academic qualifications in order to meet the full academic requirements for conferral of the title of Chartered Engineer. This is an alternative route to the 5-year undergraduate MEng route.\nThe programme is accredited by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.\nThe University of Glasgow has been delivering world-class engineering education and research since 1840.\nThe School of Engineering has an Athena Swan Silver Award, demonstrating the school’s commitment to supporting women in scientific studies and careers, and to improving the working environment for all.\nProgramme structure\nYou will attend lectures, seminars and tutorials and take part in lab, project, team and studio work, industrial visits, and workshops.\nCore courses\n\nMicroelectronics in Consumer Products 4\nAdvanced Manufacture\nCore Research Skills for Design\nPDE Introduction Project M\nGSA Elective M\nPDE Human Factors M\nIntegrated Engineering Design\n\nOptional courses\n\nAdvanced Programming and Software Engineering 3\nFault Detection, Isolation And Recovery\nInstrumentation and Data Systems 3\n\n\nProgramme alteration or discontinuationThe University of Glasgow endeavours \n                            to run all programmes as advertised.
