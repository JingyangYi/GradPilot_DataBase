Funds could cover travel expenses, living expenses, or other expenses related to the summer experience.\nNote: Penn Engineering graduate students are strongly encouraged to apply, although preference will be given to undergraduates (rising sophomores, juniors, and seniors), you should still apply.\nFor more information: https://careerservices.upenn.edu/career-services-summer-funding-program/\nThe Trustees’ Council of Penn Women will offer grants to students who have special financial needs. Grants will be for sudden, compelling, and unanticipated need due to changed financial circumstances. Examples include the death or unemployment of a parent or illness. These students would be unable to continue their studies without special financial assistance. Students should demonstrate resourcefulness and self-reliance in their quest for a Penn education, and their qualities should identify them as role models for other University students.\nFor more information: https://www.alumni.upenn.edu/s/1587/gid2/16/interior.aspx?sid=1587&gid=2&pgid=1421\nUnexpected financial circumstances can cause undergraduate, graduate, and professional students stress and impact their ability to achieve and thrive. Penn’s Division of the Vice Provost for University Life (VPUL), Office of Student Financial Services (SFS), Penn First Plus (P1P), Student Intervention Services (SIS), and Alumni Relations work collaboratively to address pressing needs and, when appropriate, adjust the student’s cost of attendance to fund a relevant opportunity or remedy an urgent situation.\nEmergency or Opportunity Grants can range from $100 to $1,000 and can be used for demonstrated needs such as: academic technology/course materials; winter or professional clothing; medical expenses; academic advancement (such as graduate school exam fees); or personal/family emergencies.\nFor more information: https://pennvpul.wufoo.com/forms/emergency-and-opportunity-funding/\nThe Kleinman Center for Energy Policy provides student and research grants as well as summer fellowships four times per year in the spring, summer, fall, and winter, and are open to individual students as well as student groups.\nGrants provided by the Kleinman Center must be prospective and funding decisions are based on funding availability, student eligibility, energy policy relevance, and completeness of the application.\nFor more information:\n\nStudent Grants\nResearch Grants\nSummer Fellowships\nThe Penn Museum Assistantship Program offers paid semester-and year-long assistantship opportunities for Penn graduate students to work on projects within the Penn Museum. The program pairs Museum projects in need of research assistance with interested graduate students from related fields.\nFor more information: https://www.penn.museum/learn/penn-students/museum-assistantship-program\n[GRID_TABLE]\nMaster’s Program:\n\nDegrees + Options\n\nMEAM MSE Requirements\nMEAM MSE Program\nMEAM MSE Course-Specific Policies\nMEAM MSE Policies and Procedures\nMaster’s Handbook\n\n\nForms\nMEAM MSE Student Networks\nCareers\nAdmissions + Financial Aid\n\n\nStaff Contact:\nByron Lee, PhD\nGraduate Program Coordinator\n229 Towne Building\nPhone: 215-746-3686\nEmail: byronlee@upenn.edu\nDegrees + Options\n\nMEAM MSE Requirements\nMEAM MSE Program\nMEAM MSE Course-Specific Policies\nMEAM MSE Policies and Procedures\nMaster’s Handbook\nMEAM MSE Requirements\nMEAM MSE Course-Specific Policies\nMaster’s Handbook\nAdmissions + Financial Aid\n[GRID_TABLE]\nDegrees + Options\n\nMEAM MSE Requirements\nMEAM MSE Program\nMEAM MSE Course-Specific Policies\nMEAM MSE Policies and Procedures\nMaster’s Handbook\nMEAM MSE Requirements\nMEAM MSE Course-Specific Policies\nMaster’s Handbook\nAdmissions + Financial Aid",

Students may count EAS 8960: Professional Master’s Career Development once towards the MEAM Seminar Requirement.\nAny exceptions to the MEAM Seminar requirement will be handled by petition (this includes exceptions for students doing the MEAM MSE program part time). MEAM MSE students may submit a petition using the MEAM MSE Academic Program Request Form.\nMEAM 6990 recognizes students’ attendance at the MEAM Seminar Series. MEAM 6990 is a zero (0) credit course that does not count towards a student’s full-time status or the MEAM MSE program’s 10 CU requirement. There are no tuition or fees assessed for this course.\nMEAM 6990 is graded Satisfactory (S)/Unsatisfactory (U) and recorded on a student’s transcript. To earn an S grade, the student must attend at least 70% of the departmental seminars and complete mini-essays for at least three of those seminars. For example, in a term in which there are 12 seminars, the student will need to attend at least 9 seminars to obtain an S grade. The three mini-essays can be spread over the semester (approximately one a month). Students may select which seminars they write the mini-essays about.\nStudents may attend and count up to two seminars outside of MEAM’s Seminar Series. To be counted, a non-MEAM seminar must be part of an established Penn seminar series that is focused on engineering, science, mathematics, computation, or another technical discipline. Students may also count attendance at MEAM PhD and Master’s defenses towards MEAM 6990 with prior approval. A mini-essay must be completed for each non-MEAM seminar, and these may count towards the mini-essay requirement. There are no exams for this course.\nIndependent study courses (MEAM 5990) can accommodate special interests of the students that are not served through Penn Engineering’s regular course offerings. They create opportunities for research projects and mentoring relationships between students and faculty. The student needs to identify the faculty supervisor, topic, and project scope during the semester prior to the one in which they intend to take the independent study.\nMEAM 5990 may only count towards the General Elective requirement, and students may only take a maximum of two independent study courses towards their MEAM MSE degree. The faculty supervisor must be a primary member of MEAM’s faculty. If the faculty supervisor is not a primary member of MEAM’s faculty, the student may request to do an independent study in the supervisor’s primary department.\nPrior to the semester in which the student wants to take the independent study, the student and the faculty supervisor must develop a proposal:\nThe student must submit their independent study proposal with the approval form signed by their Independent Study Supervisor by three (3) weeks before the start of the semester in which the independent study will commence.\nThe following guidelines will help maintain the academic rigor of an independent study course:\nThe independent study will conclude after the faculty supervisor submits a final grade for the course. It is the student’s responsibility to make sure that these guidelines are followed. Failure to follow these guidelines may result in the student not receiving credit for the independent study course.\nWhile the majority of MSE students complete an entirely coursework-based degree, there is also an option to complete a thesis during the MSE degree program. This option is open only to top MSE students and is subject to the availability of advisors with suitable research projects. Students doing a thesis typically complete the MSE in 2 years. Objectives of an MSE thesis project can include the following:\nStudents may take MEAM 9990 for up to three semesters, although the typically suggested length is 2 semesters. MEAM 9990 can be counted towards up to two (2) of the MEAM Electives requirement. One, two, or three units of MEAM 9990 may be taken in sequence, not simultaneously. Students should expect to take at least two semesters for the project and thesis writing. MEAM 9990 is graded by the student’s thesis advisor.\nStudents may take MEAM 5990 (Independent Study) for one semester and then expand the project into a thesis by taking MEAM 9990 for a second semester of the project. Students taking this route must successfully complete MEAM 5990 and then submit a new proposal, for MEAM 9990, for approval by the MEAM MSE Program Chair and the MEAM Graduate Group Chair. The new proposal must clearly demonstrate how the Independent Study project will be expanded into a thesis, and how the same project will be expanded to demonstrate original research by the student. The thesis committee will evaluate the entire scope of the thesis, including the work completed during the Independent Study. Students hoping to extend their Independent Study project into a thesis are not guaranteed that their proposals will be approved. Students who choose to expand their independent study into a thesis, may petition to count MEAM 5990 towards their MEAM Electives requirement if their thesis proposal is approved.\nStudents may not combine two Independent Study courses and call them a thesis. Students doing a thesis cannot count independent study courses (MEAM 5990) as a part of their 10 course units requirement.\nStudents who choose to write a thesis must choose an advisor and a suitable thesis topic during their second semester of graduate study. The thesis advisor must be a member of the MEAM Graduate Group. If the identified thesis advisor is not the same as the student’s faculty advisor, the student may request the Master’s Program Chair (via the Master’s Program Coordinator) change their faculty advisor to their thesis advisor.\nThe MEAM MSE Thesis Committee will be made up of 2-3 Penn faculty members: The thesis advisor, the thesis committee chair, and a thesis committee member (optional). The thesis advisor and the thesis committee chair must be MEAM Graduate Group members. The thesis advisor may not become and serve as the thesis committee chair. The optional third thesis committee member may be any Penn faculty member, with approval from the thesis advisor and the Graduate Group Chair.\nThe student will work with their thesis advisor to produce a written thesis proposal. The proposal should contain,\nThe student and thesis advisor will identify a MEAM Graduate Group member to serve on the thesis committee. The student should contact that faculty member (cc’ing the thesis advisor) with a draft of their proposal and get an agreement from the faculty member to serve on the thesis committee. The student will revise their proposal based on thesis advisor’s and thesis committee member’s feedback. The thesis advisor will evaluate and approve the revised proposal.\nAfter the proposal is approved by the thesis advisor, the Graduate Program Coordinator will then forward the proposal to the Master’s Program Chair and the Graduate Group Chair for approval and formal thesis committee appointment. The student must obtain approval of the thesis proposal at least three (3) weeks before the start of the semester in which they will take MEAM 9990 and begin the Master’s Thesis research. Students should use the MEAM 5990 & 9990 Proposal Submission Form to submit the proposal to the department.\nThe student and thesis advisor may identify a Penn faculty member who is willing to serve as a third thesis committee member (optional). This faculty member will be appointed to the thesis committee by the Graduate Group Chair.\nThe thesis must be prepared and submitted following the general Penn Engineering and University of Pennsylvania guidelines. When the thesis has been approved by the thesis advisor, a copy of the thesis must be given to each member of the Thesis Committee for review. The student should allow for at least two weeks for the review. If the Committee feels that the thesis is suitable for presentation, the student may then proceed to the thesis defense. A public announcement of the presentation must be posted at least two weeks prior to the presentation.\nThe thesis defense is a public presentation of the work, after which the Thesis Committee will give final approval or disapproval. A typical thesis defense uses the following structure:\nAfter the student successfully defends their thesis and completes any requested revisions recommended by the Thesis Committee, the final thesis must be signed by the thesis advisor and the MEAM Graduate Group Chair. Formatting requirements for the thesis can be found in the Penn Engineering Graduate Student Handbook. Students may also use the MEAM MSE Thesis Cover Page Template. The finalized thesis must be submitted to the Office of Academic Services (OAS) and to the MEAM Graduate Program Coordinator by email. The thesis must be submitted by the University-specified date prior to commencement.

If the identified thesis advisor is not the same as the student’s faculty advisor, the student may request the Master’s Program Chair (via the Master’s Program Coordinator) change their faculty advisor to their thesis advisor. \nThe MEAM MSE Thesis Committee will be made up of 2-3 Penn faculty members: The thesis advisor, the thesis committee chair, and a thesis committee member (optional). The thesis advisor and the thesis committee chair must be MEAM Graduate Group members. The thesis advisor may not become and serve as the thesis committee chair. The optional third thesis committee member may be any Penn faculty member, with approval from the thesis advisor and the Graduate Group Chair.\nThe student will work with their thesis advisor to produce a written thesis proposal. The proposal should contain,\n\na statement of the objective of the work,\na literature review,\na description of the scope of the study,\nan outline of the proposed final document, and\na proposed timeline.\n\nThe student and thesis advisor will identify a MEAM Graduate Group member to serve on the thesis committee. The student should contact that faculty member (cc’ing the thesis advisor) with a draft of their proposal and get an agreement from the faculty member to serve on the thesis committee. The student will revise their proposal based on thesis advisor’s and thesis committee member’s feedback. The thesis advisor will evaluate and approve the revised proposal.\nAfter the proposal is approved by the thesis advisor, the Graduate Program Coordinator will then forward the proposal to the Master’s Program Chair and the Graduate Group Chair for approval and formal thesis committee appointment. The student must obtain approval of the thesis proposal at least three (3) weeks before the start of the semester in which they will take MEAM 9990 and begin the Master’s Thesis research. Students should use the MEAM 5990 & 9990 Proposal Submission Form to submit the proposal to the department.\nThe student and thesis advisor may identify a Penn faculty member who is willing to serve as a third thesis committee member (optional). This faculty member will be appointed to the thesis committee by the Graduate Group Chair.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Thesis and Defense\n\n\n\n\nThe thesis must be prepared and submitted following the general Penn Engineering and University of Pennsylvania guidelines. When the thesis has been approved by the thesis advisor, a copy of the thesis must be given to each member of the Thesis Committee for review. The student should allow for at least two weeks for the review. If the Committee feels that the thesis is suitable for presentation, the student may then proceed to the thesis defense. A public announcement of the presentation must be posted at least two weeks prior to the presentation.\nThe thesis defense is a public presentation of the work, after which the Thesis Committee will give final approval or disapproval. A typical thesis defense uses the following structure:\n\nThesis presentation\nPublic Q&A\nClosed-door Q&A with just the student and the Thesis Committee\nClosed-door deliberation by the Thesis Committee\nDiscussion and Decision between the student and the Thesis Committee\n\nAfter the student successfully defends their thesis and completes any requested revisions recommended by the Thesis Committee, the final thesis must be signed by the thesis advisor and the MEAM Graduate Group Chair. Formatting requirements for the thesis can be found in the Penn Engineering Graduate Student Handbook. Students may also use the MEAM MSE Thesis Cover Page Template. The finalized thesis must be submitted to the Office of Academic Services (OAS) and to the MEAM Graduate Program Coordinator by email. The thesis must be submitted by the University-specified date prior to commencement. Failure to follow the above schedule and requirements will result in a delay in awarding the student’s degree.\nMEAM MSE Course-Specific Policies\nMEAM Seminar Requirement\nFull-time MEAM MSE students and Accelerated Master’s students must attend two semesters of the MEAM Seminar Series. The MEAM department seminars help expand the scope and learning for MEAM MSE students:\n\nThe seminar provides an opportunity to learn about state-of-the-art research and issues in MEAM, including outside of students’ specific or direct research interests.\nThe seminar provides an opportunity for students to get acquainted with people from other institutions and companies.\nThe seminars are an excellent opportunity to get together as a department. Students can meet peers as well as faculty members.\n\nWe strongly recommend that students take MEAM 6990 at least once during their first year of study. Students may count EAS 8960: Professional Master’s Career Development once towards the MEAM Seminar Requirement.\nAny exceptions to the MEAM Seminar requirement will be handled by petition (this includes exceptions for students doing the MEAM MSE program part time). MEAM MSE students may submit a petition using the MEAM MSE Academic Program Request Form.\n\n\n\nMEAM 6990: MEAM Seminar\n\n\n\n\nMEAM 6990 recognizes students’ attendance at the MEAM Seminar Series. MEAM 6990 is a zero (0) credit course that does not count towards a student’s full-time status or the MEAM MSE program’s 10 CU requirement. There are no tuition or fees assessed for this course.\nMEAM 6990 is graded Satisfactory (S)/Unsatisfactory (U) and recorded on a student’s transcript. To earn an S grade, the student must attend at least 70% of the departmental seminars and complete mini-essays for at least three of those seminars. For example, in a term in which there are 12 seminars, the student will need to attend at least 9 seminars to obtain an S grade. The three mini-essays can be spread over the semester (approximately one a month). Students may select which seminars they write the mini-essays about.\nStudents may attend and count up to two seminars outside of MEAM’s Seminar Series. To be counted, a non-MEAM seminar must be part of an established Penn seminar series that is focused on engineering, science, mathematics, computation, or another technical discipline. Students may also count attendance at MEAM PhD and Master’s defenses towards MEAM 6990 with prior approval. A mini-essay must be completed for each non-MEAM seminar, and these may count towards the mini-essay requirement. There are no exams for this course.\nMEAM 6990 recognizes students’ attendance at the MEAM Seminar Series.

There are no exams for this course.\nIndependent Study\nIndependent study courses (MEAM 5990) can accommodate special interests of the students that are not served through Penn Engineering’s regular course offerings. They create opportunities for research projects and mentoring relationships between students and faculty. The student needs to identify the faculty supervisor, topic, and project scope during the semester prior to the one in which they intend to take the independent study. \n\n\n\nMEAM 5990: Independent Study\n\n\n\n\nMEAM 5990 may only count towards the General Elective requirement, and students may only take a maximum of two independent study courses towards their MEAM MSE degree. The faculty supervisor must be a primary member of MEAM’s faculty. If the faculty supervisor is not a primary member of MEAM’s faculty, the student may request to do an independent study in the supervisor’s primary department.\nPrior to the semester in which the student wants to take the independent study, the student and the faculty supervisor must develop a proposal:\n\nThe first section of the proposal should describe the objectives, scope, content, and schedule of the independent study.\nThe second section should state how the independent study will be evaluated and how the student will be graded.\nThe proposal should be signed by both the student and the faculty supervisor and then be submitted to the Graduate Program Coordinator, who will convey it to the Master’s Program Chair for approval. Students should use the MEAM 5990 & 9990 Proposal Submission Form to submit the proposal to the department.\n\nThe student must submit their independent study proposal with the approval form signed by their Independent Study Supervisor by three (3) weeks before the start of the semester in which the independent study will commence.\nThe following guidelines will help maintain the academic rigor of an independent study course:\n\nAn independent study course should require a comparable amount of work to that of a regular course, about 9 hours a week, or a total of 126 hours per semester.\nThe student and faculty supervisor should meet on a regular basis – we recommend at least once a week. It is the student’s responsibility to schedule these weekly meetings.\nAn independent study course’s schedule should require steady work, ideally by setting assignments or progress checks throughout the semester. The student should not expect to be able to cram a semester’s worth of work into a few days of intensive work at the end of the semester.\n\nThe independent study will conclude after the faculty supervisor submits a final grade for the course. It is the student’s responsibility to make sure that these guidelines are followed. Failure to follow these guidelines may result in the student not receiving credit for the independent study course.\nMEAM 5990 may only count towards the General Elective requirement, and students may only take a maximum of two independent study courses towards their MEAM MSE degree.

Failure to follow these guidelines may result in the student not receiving credit for the independent study course.\nMEAM MSE Thesis Option\nWhile the majority of MSE students complete an entirely coursework-based degree, there is also an option to complete a thesis during the MSE degree program. This option is open only to top MSE students and is subject to the availability of advisors with suitable research projects. Students doing a thesis typically complete the MSE in 2 years. Objectives of an MSE thesis project can include the following:\n\nTo advance the state-of-the-art in research.\nTo solve new problems with existing tools.\nTo develop a new instrument or measurement technique, or a computer program for analysis or advanced design.\n\n\n\n\nMEAM 9990: Master’s Thesis Research\n\n\n\n\nStudents may take MEAM 9990 for up to three semesters, although the typically suggested length is 2 semesters. MEAM 9990 can be counted towards up to two (2) of the MEAM Electives requirement. One, two, or three units of MEAM 9990 may be taken in sequence, not simultaneously. Students should expect to take at least two semesters for the project and thesis writing. MEAM 9990 is graded by the student’s thesis advisor. \nStudents may take MEAM 5990 (Independent Study) for one semester and then expand the project into a thesis by taking MEAM 9990 for a second semester of the project. Students taking this route must successfully complete MEAM 5990 and then submit a new proposal, for MEAM 9990, for approval by the MEAM MSE Program Chair and the MEAM Graduate Group Chair. The new proposal must clearly demonstrate how the Independent Study project will be expanded into a thesis, and how the same project will be expanded to demonstrate original research by the student. The thesis committee will evaluate the entire scope of the thesis, including the work completed during the Independent Study. Students hoping to extend their Independent Study project into a thesis are not guaranteed that their proposals will be approved. Students who choose to expand their independent study into a thesis, may petition to count MEAM 5990 towards their MEAM Electives requirement if their thesis proposal is approved. \nStudents may not combine two Independent Study courses and call them a thesis. Students doing a thesis cannot count independent study courses (MEAM 5990) as a part of their 10 course units requirement.\n\n\n\n\n\nMSE Thesis Proposal & Committee\n\n\n\n\nStudents who choose to write a thesis must choose an advisor and a suitable thesis topic during their second semester of graduate study. The thesis advisor must be a member of the MEAM Graduate Group. If the identified thesis advisor is not the same as the student’s faculty advisor, the student may request the Master’s Program Chair (via the Master’s Program Coordinator) change their faculty advisor to their thesis advisor. \nThe MEAM MSE Thesis Committee will be made up of 2-3 Penn faculty members: The thesis advisor, the thesis committee chair, and a thesis committee member (optional). The thesis advisor and the thesis committee chair must be MEAM Graduate Group members. The thesis advisor may not become and serve as the thesis committee chair. The optional third thesis committee member may be any Penn faculty member, with approval from the thesis advisor and the Graduate Group Chair.\nThe student will work with their thesis advisor to produce a written thesis proposal. The proposal should contain,\n\na statement of the objective of the work,\na literature review,\na description of the scope of the study,\nan outline of the proposed final document, and\na proposed timeline.\n\nThe student and thesis advisor will identify a MEAM Graduate Group member to serve on the thesis committee. The student should contact that faculty member (cc’ing the thesis advisor) with a draft of their proposal and get an agreement from the faculty member to serve on the thesis committee.

The thesis advisor will evaluate and approve the revised proposal.\nAfter the proposal is approved by the thesis advisor, the Graduate Program Coordinator will then forward the proposal to the Master’s Program Chair and the Graduate Group Chair for approval and formal thesis committee appointment. The student must obtain approval of the thesis proposal at least three (3) weeks before the start of the semester in which they will take MEAM 9990 and begin the Master’s Thesis research. Students should use the MEAM 5990 & 9990 Proposal Submission Form to submit the proposal to the department.\nThe student and thesis advisor may identify a Penn faculty member who is willing to serve as a third thesis committee member (optional). This faculty member will be appointed to the thesis committee by the Graduate Group Chair.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Thesis and Defense\n\n\n\n\nThe thesis must be prepared and submitted following the general Penn Engineering and University of Pennsylvania guidelines. When the thesis has been approved by the thesis advisor, a copy of the thesis must be given to each member of the Thesis Committee for review. The student should allow for at least two weeks for the review. If the Committee feels that the thesis is suitable for presentation, the student may then proceed to the thesis defense.

MEAM 6990 is a zero (0) credit course that does not count towards a student’s full-time status or the MEAM MSE program’s 10 CU requirement. There are no tuition or fees assessed for this course.\nMEAM 6990 is graded Satisfactory (S)/Unsatisfactory (U) and recorded on a student’s transcript. To earn an S grade, the student must attend at least 70% of the departmental seminars and complete mini-essays for at least three of those seminars. For example, in a term in which there are 12 seminars, the student will need to attend at least 9 seminars to obtain an S grade. The three mini-essays can be spread over the semester (approximately one a month). Students may select which seminars they write the mini-essays about.\nStudents may attend and count up to two seminars outside of MEAM’s Seminar Series. To be counted, a non-MEAM seminar must be part of an established Penn seminar series that is focused on engineering, science, mathematics, computation, or another technical discipline. Students may also count attendance at MEAM PhD and Master’s defenses towards MEAM 6990 with prior approval.

MEAM 9990 is graded by the student’s thesis advisor. \nStudents may take MEAM 5990 (Independent Study) for one semester and then expand the project into a thesis by taking MEAM 9990 for a second semester of the project. Students taking this route must successfully complete MEAM 5990 and then submit a new proposal, for MEAM 9990, for approval by the MEAM MSE Program Chair and the MEAM Graduate Group Chair. The new proposal must clearly demonstrate how the Independent Study project will be expanded into a thesis, and how the same project will be expanded to demonstrate original research by the student. The thesis committee will evaluate the entire scope of the thesis, including the work completed during the Independent Study. Students hoping to extend their Independent Study project into a thesis are not guaranteed that their proposals will be approved. Students who choose to expand their independent study into a thesis, may petition to count MEAM 5990 towards their MEAM Electives requirement if their thesis proposal is approved. \nStudents may not combine two Independent Study courses and call them a thesis. Students doing a thesis cannot count independent study courses (MEAM 5990) as a part of their 10 course units requirement.\n\n\n\n\n\nMSE Thesis Proposal & Committee\n\n\n\n\nStudents who choose to write a thesis must choose an advisor and a suitable thesis topic during their second semester of graduate study. The thesis advisor must be a member of the MEAM Graduate Group. If the identified thesis advisor is not the same as the student’s faculty advisor, the student may request the Master’s Program Chair (via the Master’s Program Coordinator) change their faculty advisor to their thesis advisor. \nThe MEAM MSE Thesis Committee will be made up of 2-3 Penn faculty members: The thesis advisor, the thesis committee chair, and a thesis committee member (optional). The thesis advisor and the thesis committee chair must be MEAM Graduate Group members. The thesis advisor may not become and serve as the thesis committee chair. The optional third thesis committee member may be any Penn faculty member, with approval from the thesis advisor and the Graduate Group Chair.\nThe student will work with their thesis advisor to produce a written thesis proposal. The proposal should contain,\n\na statement of the objective of the work,\na literature review,\na description of the scope of the study,\nan outline of the proposed final document, and\na proposed timeline.\n\nThe student and thesis advisor will identify a MEAM Graduate Group member to serve on the thesis committee. The student should contact that faculty member (cc’ing the thesis advisor) with a draft of their proposal and get an agreement from the faculty member to serve on the thesis committee. The student will revise their proposal based on thesis advisor’s and thesis committee member’s feedback. The thesis advisor will evaluate and approve the revised proposal.\nAfter the proposal is approved by the thesis advisor, the Graduate Program Coordinator will then forward the proposal to the Master’s Program Chair and the Graduate Group Chair for approval and formal thesis committee appointment. The student must obtain approval of the thesis proposal at least three (3) weeks before the start of the semester in which they will take MEAM 9990 and begin the Master’s Thesis research. Students should use the MEAM 5990 & 9990 Proposal Submission Form to submit the proposal to the department.\nThe student and thesis advisor may identify a Penn faculty member who is willing to serve as a third thesis committee member (optional). This faculty member will be appointed to the thesis committee by the Graduate Group Chair.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Thesis and Defense\n\n\n\n\nThe thesis must be prepared and submitted following the general Penn Engineering and University of Pennsylvania guidelines. When the thesis has been approved by the thesis advisor, a copy of the thesis must be given to each member of the Thesis Committee for review. The student should allow for at least two weeks for the review. If the Committee feels that the thesis is suitable for presentation, the student may then proceed to the thesis defense. A public announcement of the presentation must be posted at least two weeks prior to the presentation.\nThe thesis defense is a public presentation of the work, after which the Thesis Committee will give final approval or disapproval. A typical thesis defense uses the following structure:\n\nThesis presentation\nPublic Q&A\nClosed-door Q&A with just the student and the Thesis Committee\nClosed-door deliberation by the Thesis Committee\nDiscussion and Decision between the student and the Thesis Committee\n\nAfter the student successfully defends their thesis and completes any requested revisions recommended by the Thesis Committee, the final thesis must be signed by the thesis advisor and the MEAM Graduate Group Chair. Formatting requirements for the thesis can be found in the Penn Engineering Graduate Student Handbook. Students may also use the MEAM MSE Thesis Cover Page Template. The finalized thesis must be submitted to the Office of Academic Services (OAS) and to the MEAM Graduate Program Coordinator by email. The thesis must be submitted by the University-specified date prior to commencement.

The MEAM department seminars help expand the scope and learning for MEAM MSE students:\n\nThe seminar provides an opportunity to learn about state-of-the-art research and issues in MEAM, including outside of students’ specific or direct research interests.\nThe seminar provides an opportunity for students to get acquainted with people from other institutions and companies.\nThe seminars are an excellent opportunity to get together as a department. Students can meet peers as well as faculty members.\n\nWe strongly recommend that students take MEAM 6990 at least once during their first year of study. Students may count EAS 8960: Professional Master’s Career Development once towards the MEAM Seminar Requirement.\nAny exceptions to the MEAM Seminar requirement will be handled by petition (this includes exceptions for students doing the MEAM MSE program part time). MEAM MSE students may submit a petition using the MEAM MSE Academic Program Request Form.\n\n\n\nMEAM 6990: MEAM Seminar\n\n\n\n\nMEAM 6990 recognizes students’ attendance at the MEAM Seminar Series. MEAM 6990 is a zero (0) credit course that does not count towards a student’s full-time status or the MEAM MSE program’s 10 CU requirement. There are no tuition or fees assessed for this course.\nMEAM 6990 is graded Satisfactory (S)/Unsatisfactory (U) and recorded on a student’s transcript. To earn an S grade, the student must attend at least 70% of the departmental seminars and complete mini-essays for at least three of those seminars. For example, in a term in which there are 12 seminars, the student will need to attend at least 9 seminars to obtain an S grade. The three mini-essays can be spread over the semester (approximately one a month). Students may select which seminars they write the mini-essays about.\nStudents may attend and count up to two seminars outside of MEAM’s Seminar Series. To be counted, a non-MEAM seminar must be part of an established Penn seminar series that is focused on engineering, science, mathematics, computation, or another technical discipline. Students may also count attendance at MEAM PhD and Master’s defenses towards MEAM 6990 with prior approval. A mini-essay must be completed for each non-MEAM seminar, and these may count towards the mini-essay requirement. There are no exams for this course.\nMEAM 6990 recognizes students’ attendance at the MEAM Seminar Series.

They create opportunities for research projects and mentoring relationships between students and faculty. The student needs to identify the faculty supervisor, topic, and project scope during the semester prior to the one in which they intend to take the independent study. \n\n\n\nMEAM 5990: Independent Study\n\n\n\n\nMEAM 5990 may only count towards the General Elective requirement, and students may only take a maximum of two independent study courses towards their MEAM MSE degree. The faculty supervisor must be a primary member of MEAM’s faculty. If the faculty supervisor is not a primary member of MEAM’s faculty, the student may request to do an independent study in the supervisor’s primary department.\nPrior to the semester in which the student wants to take the independent study, the student and the faculty supervisor must develop a proposal:\n\nThe first section of the proposal should describe the objectives, scope, content, and schedule of the independent study.\nThe second section should state how the independent study will be evaluated and how the student will be graded.\nThe proposal should be signed by both the student and the faculty supervisor and then be submitted to the Graduate Program Coordinator, who will convey it to the Master’s Program Chair for approval. Students should use the MEAM 5990 & 9990 Proposal Submission Form to submit the proposal to the department.\n\nThe student must submit their independent study proposal with the approval form signed by their Independent Study Supervisor by three (3) weeks before the start of the semester in which the independent study will commence.\nThe following guidelines will help maintain the academic rigor of an independent study course:\n\nAn independent study course should require a comparable amount of work to that of a regular course, about 9 hours a week, or a total of 126 hours per semester.\nThe student and faculty supervisor should meet on a regular basis – we recommend at least once a week. It is the student’s responsibility to schedule these weekly meetings.\nAn independent study course’s schedule should require steady work, ideally by setting assignments or progress checks throughout the semester. The student should not expect to be able to cram a semester’s worth of work into a few days of intensive work at the end of the semester.\n\nThe independent study will conclude after the faculty supervisor submits a final grade for the course. It is the student’s responsibility to make sure that these guidelines are followed. Failure to follow these guidelines may result in the student not receiving credit for the independent study course.\nMEAM 5990 may only count towards the General Elective requirement, and students may only take a maximum of two independent study courses towards their MEAM MSE degree.

A typical thesis defense uses the following structure:\n\nThesis presentation\nPublic Q&A\nClosed-door Q&A with just the student and the Thesis Committee\nClosed-door deliberation by the Thesis Committee\nDiscussion and Decision between the student and the Thesis Committee\n\nAfter the student successfully defends their thesis and completes any requested revisions recommended by the Thesis Committee, the final thesis must be signed by the thesis advisor and the MEAM Graduate Group Chair. Formatting requirements for the thesis can be found in the Penn Engineering Graduate Student Handbook. Students may also use the MEAM MSE Thesis Cover Page Template. The finalized thesis must be submitted to the Office of Academic Services (OAS) and to the MEAM Graduate Program Coordinator by email. The thesis must be submitted by the University-specified date prior to commencement. Failure to follow the above schedule and requirements will result in a delay in awarding the student’s degree.\n[GRID_TABLE]\nMaster’s Program:\n\nDegrees + Options\n\nMEAM MSE Requirements\nMEAM MSE Program\nMEAM MSE Course-Specific Policies\nMEAM MSE Policies and Procedures\nMaster’s Handbook\n\n\nForms\nMEAM MSE Student Networks\nCareers\nAdmissions + Financial Aid\n\n\nStaff Contact:\nByron Lee, PhD\nGraduate Program Coordinator\n229 Towne Building\nPhone: 215-746-3686\nEmail: byronlee@upenn.edu\nDegrees + Options\n\nMEAM MSE Requirements\nMEAM MSE Program\nMEAM MSE Course-Specific Policies\nMEAM MSE Policies and Procedures\nMaster’s Handbook\nMEAM MSE Requirements\nMEAM MSE Course-Specific Policies\nMaster’s Handbook\nAdmissions + Financial Aid\n[GRID_TABLE]\nDegrees + Options\n\nMEAM MSE Requirements\nMEAM MSE Program\nMEAM MSE Course-Specific Policies\nMEAM MSE Policies and Procedures\nMaster’s Handbook\nMEAM MSE Requirements\nMEAM MSE Course-Specific Policies\nMaster’s Handbook\nAdmissions + Financial Aid",

The current members of the MEAM Graduate Group and their research areas can be viewed on the MEAM Graduate Group website.\nEach MEAM MSE student is assigned a faculty advisor who works with the student to develop a program of study. The faculty advisor is responsible for monitoring the student’s academic plan and, if applicable, thesis work. A student may request a change of advisor, if necessary, after the first semester which will be considered and approved by the Master’s Program Chair.\nAll graduate programs in Penn Engineering are administratively under the auspices of the Office of Academic Services (OAS).\nStudents are considered full time if they are enrolled in at least 3 CUs during a semester. Students are considered to be part time if they take only 2.99 or fewer CUs in a single semester.\nMEAM MSE students are required to be continuously registered during Fall and Spring semesters. Students are not expected to enroll in Summer semesters.\nEach semester, a registration hold is placed on all MEAM graduate student accounts before Advance Registration. Students are required to consult with their faculty advisors and go over their course registration plans to have their registration holds lifted.\nMost students complete the degree in four (4) semesters in two (2) years. MEAM courses are not regularly offered during the summer (with the exception of MEAM 6990), but other courses from Penn Engineering may be offered.\nThis is a basic course plan for full time students. The lighter course load in the final semester gives students time for job hunting, interviewing, and other activities in preparation for post-graduation.

The AFS is usually a continuation of a summer Curricular Practical Training (CPT) internship. Domestic students may follow Course Plan 3 by taking a Leave of Absence during their 3rd semester.\nSemester 1: Fall\n3 CUs + MEAM 6990\nStudents in the MEAM MSE program may take up to five courses in a semester if they are in excellent academic standing (with a GPA of 3.8 or better after at least 1 semester of full-time studies in the graduate program), with approval from their faculty advisor and the Master’s Program Chair. Part-time students may take one or two courses per semester.\nOutstanding undergraduate students at the University of Pennsylvania and participating schools may apply for an Accelerated Master’s (AM) in the MEAM MSE degree program. Students in the AM program can earn the MEAM MSE in up to one additional year of study (1 or 2 semesters) after earning their bachelor’s degrees. Undergraduate students at the University of Pennsylvania need to meet with both their Undergraduate Program Coordinator and the MEAM Master’s Program Coordinator before applying to the program.\nThe application for the AM program should be submitted during a student’s sophomore or junior year. Learn more and find the application here.\nMEAM accepts AM students from select external schools. Learn more about the program for non-Penn students here.\nAM students must complete their undergraduate degree(s) in 8 semesters, or 10 semesters for students in select dual-degree programs. Undergraduate students in uncoordinated dual degrees are ineligible for the AM program. AM students may double-count up to three graduate-level courses towards both their undergraduate and the graduate degrees. AM students may also take additional graduate-level courses (which cannot be counted towards the undergraduate degree) during their undergraduate program(s) to complete their MSE degrees in fewer than 2 additional semesters (after they graduate from their undergraduate program(s)). AM students may be enrolled in no more than 50% graduate-level courses during a single semester before they graduate from their undergraduate program(s).\nStudents will only be able to take up to 3 CUs of graduate level (5000+) courses, prior to matriculation into AM, to count towards the master’s degree. These courses must be used only as double counted courses, counting towards both the undergraduate and master’s degrees. Any additional graduate level (5000+) courses (beyond the 3 CUs) taken prior to matriculation into the AM program will not be eligible to count towards the master’s degree. These courses will remain only on the undergrad transcript. AM students can only count graduate courses taken at the University of Pennsylvania towards the master’s degree. No transfer credit, study abroad, or study away courses will be accepted.\nAM students completing their undergraduate degrees at the University of Pennsylvania must meet the prerequisite or recommended undergraduate course requirements for MEAM graduate-level courses.

Part-time students may take one or two courses per semester.\n \nAccelerated Master’s Program\nOutstanding undergraduate students at the University of Pennsylvania and participating schools may apply for an Accelerated Master’s (AM) in the MEAM MSE degree program. Students in the AM program can earn the MEAM MSE in up to one additional year of study (1 or 2 semesters) after earning their bachelor’s degrees. Undergraduate students at the University of Pennsylvania need to meet with both their Undergraduate Program Coordinator and the MEAM Master’s Program Coordinator before applying to the program.\nThe application for the AM program should be submitted during a student’s sophomore or junior year.

AM students may also take additional graduate-level courses (which cannot be counted towards the undergraduate degree) during their undergraduate program(s) to complete their MSE degrees in fewer than 2 additional semesters (after they graduate from their undergraduate program(s)). AM students may be enrolled in no more than 50% graduate-level courses during a single semester before they graduate from their undergraduate program(s).\nStudents will only be able to take up to 3 CUs of graduate level (5000+) courses, prior to matriculation into AM, to count towards the master’s degree. These courses must be used only as double counted courses, counting towards both the undergraduate and master’s degrees. Any additional graduate level (5000+) courses (beyond the 3 CUs) taken prior to matriculation into the AM program will not be eligible to count towards the master’s degree. These courses will remain only on the undergrad transcript. AM students can only count graduate courses taken at the University of Pennsylvania towards the master’s degree.

The current members of the MEAM Graduate Group and their research areas can be viewed on the MEAM Graduate Group website.\nEach MEAM MSE student is assigned a faculty advisor who works with the student to develop a program of study. The faculty advisor is responsible for monitoring the student’s academic plan and, if applicable, thesis work. A student may request a change of advisor, if necessary, after the first semester which will be considered and approved by the Master’s Program Chair.\nAll graduate programs in Penn Engineering are administratively under the auspices of the Office of Academic Services (OAS).\n \nFull and Part Time Study\nStudents are considered full time if they are enrolled in at least 3 CUs during a semester. Students are considered to be part time if they take only 2.99 or fewer CUs in a single semester. \nMEAM MSE students are required to be continuously registered during Fall and Spring semesters. Students are not expected to enroll in Summer semesters.\n \nCourse Curriculum Planning\nEach semester, a registration hold is placed on all MEAM graduate student accounts before Advance Registration. Students are required to consult with their faculty advisors and go over their course registration plans to have their registration holds lifted.\nMost students complete the degree in four (4) semesters in two (2) years. MEAM courses are not regularly offered during the summer (with the exception of MEAM 6990), but other courses from Penn Engineering may be offered.\n\n\n\nCourse Plan 1\n\n\n\n\nThis is a basic course plan for full time students.

In response to these demands companies have been exploring new methods to decrease costs, increase productivity, and create innovative products. In keeping with the needs of local industry the graduate courses below prepare students for careers in Product Design and Manufacturing. Students in the program will study topics such as mechatronics, CAD, computer graphics, industrial design, product design, materials engineering, manufacturing processes, assembly, tolerances, design analysis, plant/process modeling and design, robotics, electrical systems, mechanical systems, controls, intellectual property, and management skills. Graduates of the program will be prepared to be leaders in the global manufacturing environment. Much of our work involves collaborations with, among others, the Departments of Computer and Information Science, Electrical and Systems Engineering as well as the School of Design and the Wharton School of Business Administration.\nAerospace engineering, materials fabrication and manufacturing, cooling of microelectronic equipment, energy conversion and power generation, and thermal control and treatment of living organisms are critically important in today’s economy. Our program in heat transfer, fluid mechanics, and energy is designed to provide the basic tools for dealing with these and other problems of current and future technological interest. The program maintains close collaboration with the departments of Chemical Engineering, Bioengineering, Electrical and Systems Engineering, and Materials Science.\nThe development of new technologies often depends critically on the availability of materials systems capable of withstanding extreme thermomechanical loading conditions. Current examples are provided by the development of advanced engines in the aerospace industry and the design of microchips that are resistant to thermal cycling in the microelectronics industry. In addition, new technologies, such as biomedical technologies, often require the development and understanding of completely new classes of materials systems. The Penn MEAM MSE in Mechanics of Materials is designed to provide the fundamental tools needed to tackle these and other problems of current and future technological interest. These include basic courses in continuum mechanics, elasticity, and plasticity, as well as more advanced ones in fracture, composite materials, biomechanics, and atomistic modeling of materials. The program maintains close collaborations with the Material Science Department and with the bio-medical community.\nOngoing effort in mechanical systems focuses on modeling and controlling dynamical systems, especially as applied to mechatronic and robotic systems. The graduate courses provide students with a firm theoretical foundation and the interdisciplinary experimental skills that are necessary for dealing with modern-day complex systems. Much of our work involves collaborations with Computer and Information Science and Electrical and Systems Engineering, as well as the Wharton School of Business Administration.\nMicro/Nano systems is a broad field encompassing the design, development, and fabrication of devices and systems that derive unique functionality due to the small size of key components within them. Examples of such systems include microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), nanoelectronic devices, and microfluidics. Mechanical Engineering plays a central role in all of these systems, such as the mechanical design of MEMS-based sensors and the understanding of heat transfer in nanoelectronics. The graduate courses in this area of concentration provide students with a solid theoretical foundation, knowledge of micro/nano-fabrication techniques, and skills to design micro/nano systems.\nMEAM MSE students must officially declare their concentrations before they graduate. Students must themselves declare their concentrations – MEAM staff and faculty cannot do this for students.\nCurriculum Change Request\nAny exceptions from the rules described above will be handled by petition.

Current examples are provided by the development of advanced engines in the aerospace industry and the design of microchips that are resistant to thermal cycling in the microelectronics industry. In addition, new technologies, such as biomedical technologies, often require the development and understanding of completely new classes of materials systems. The Penn MEAM MSE in Mechanics of Materials is designed to provide the fundamental tools needed to tackle these and other problems of current and future technological interest. These include basic courses in continuum mechanics, elasticity, and plasticity, as well as more advanced ones in fracture, composite materials, biomechanics, and atomistic modeling of materials. The program maintains close collaborations with the Material Science Department and with the bio-medical community.\n\n\n\n\n\nMechatronic and Robotic Systems\n\n\n\n\nOngoing effort in mechanical systems focuses on modeling and controlling dynamical systems, especially as applied to mechatronic and robotic systems. The graduate courses provide students with a firm theoretical foundation and the interdisciplinary experimental skills that are necessary for dealing with modern-day complex systems. Much of our work involves collaborations with Computer and Information Science and Electrical and Systems Engineering, as well as the Wharton School of Business Administration.\n\n\n\n\n\nMicro/Nano Systems\n\n\n\n\nMicro/Nano systems is a broad field encompassing the design, development, and fabrication of devices and systems that derive unique functionality due to the small size of key components within them. Examples of such systems include microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), nanoelectronic devices, and microfluidics. Mechanical Engineering plays a central role in all of these systems, such as the mechanical design of MEMS-based sensors and the understanding of heat transfer in nanoelectronics. The graduate courses in this area of concentration provide students with a solid theoretical foundation, knowledge of micro/nano-fabrication techniques, and skills to design micro/nano systems.\nGlobal business trends have created a demand for companies to rapidly develop new products at lower costs.
