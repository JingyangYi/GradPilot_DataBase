It is a dynamic industry that requires forward planning to execute a seamless event.This major will give you practical, vocational workplace skills and the theoretical knowledge necessary to operate effectively in a business context.This qualification provides a pathway to work in events in a range of industries including tourism and travel, hospitality, sport, cultural, and community sectors. After graduating with a Bachelor of Business and a TAFE Advanced Diploma of Event Management, you could work in event management companies, event venues or organisations that run their own events.The first year of the degree is a combination of TAFE and University study while the remaining two years of the degree are University only. Within the Bachelor of Business component of the degree, you can major in human resource management, management, marketing or public relations to complement your TAFE Advanced Diploma of Event Management.From marketing, budgeting, time management and scheduling to production, sponsorship and technical operations, you will graduate with the skills and knowledge required in the events industry. You will have the opportunity to plan and deliver a minimum of one live event. This includes all aspects of the event including concept, budgeting, registration and ticketing, marketing and social media, sponsorship, venue management, talent liaison, and production.You will also undertake a final-year capstone subject, plus, you have the option of applying for an internship to gain valuable experience whilst receiving credit towards your degree.See the course handbook for more information.  \nYou can specialise in a major by choosing from the following: Major Campus Availability Human Resource Management Wollongong (On Campus) Management Wollongong (On Campus) Marketing Wollongong (On Campus) Public Relations Wollongong (On Campus) Sport Marketing and Management Wollongong (On Campus) For enquiries on the TAFE component of this degree, please contact TAFE NSW.  \n\nSee more\n[GRID_TABLE]\nCareers\nCommunity Development OfficerCommunity Event ManagerConference PlannerEvents CoordinatorFestival OrganiserSponsorship ManagerVenue Manager \nSee more\n[GRID_TABLE]\nSearch all courses\nSearch all courses\n[CARD]\nFor personalised assistance with UOW courses, please reach out to our Future Students Team:Phone: 1300 367 869 (within Australia) or +61 2 4221 3218 (overseas)Email: future-students@uow.edu.auEnquiry Form: Submit an enquiryOur team is available during Australian business hours, 9 am to 5 pm.For other UOW contact details, click here.\nFor personalised assistance with UOW courses, please reach out to our Future Students Team:Phone: +61 2 4221 3218Email: future-students@uow.edu.auEnquiry Form: Submit an enquiryOur team is available during Australian business hours, 9 am to 5 pm.For other UOW contact details, click here.\n[CARD]\nIf you’re planning to study at UOW immediately after finishing your HSC, International Baccalaureate (IB), or an interstate equivalent, you can apply for Early Admission to this course.
