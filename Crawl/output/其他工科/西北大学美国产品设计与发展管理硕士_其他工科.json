I learned new ways to understand the world and the complicated, interconnected nature of how humans interact with each other and their environments.\nI was a bit of the stereotypical millennial job-hopper, jumping from startup to startup, stuck in this elevator that would only go up or down. I needed a Wonkavator, something that could allow me to go sideways, slantways, longways, backways, squareways, roundways and any other ways you can think of. I felt mpd² offered that.\nA professor would say something in a class, and suddenly I’d understand something I’d been pondering at work. Or someone at work would bring up a topic, and I could share a piece of relevant learning from a recent class. I found it really rewarding.\nUnique Program Features\nOur faculty, alumni, and current students come from some of the most innovative companies in the world.

We look for applicants with diverse backgrounds who are eager to enhance their design thinking, leadership, and strategic management skills. Our program values both your professional experience and your potential for future success, so we welcome candidates who demonstrate creativity, collaboration, and a passion for bringing new products to life.\nOn this page, you’ll find important information about our admissions requirements, deadlines, and application process, as well as details on how we evaluate candidates. Get started on your path to becoming a leader in product development today.\nWe admit new students annually during the fall quarter. The application opens one year before classes start in early September and closes the following August 1st. We review applications as we receive them until all seats are filled in the cohort. Our cohorts are small, with 20-30 students admitted every year.\nRound One: March 15th\nWe recommend Round One for any candidates for whom mpd² is their top choice graduate program.\nRound Two: June 15th\nRound Two is the final application review round for international applicants requiring a student visa.\nRound Three: August 1st\nRound Three is the final application review round. Please note that the application closes after this round concludes, so submitting your application before the August 1st deadline is crucial.\nApplications are accepted and reviewed on an ongoing basis starting in September for acceptance to the next class.\nApplicants to mpd² complete an online application, which will require them to provide some personal information and upload the following materials:\nmpd² does not require official transcripts for the application review process. You can upload an unofficial copy to your application form. However, we do ask admitted students to submit official copies of their transcripts as part of their enrollment and new student onboarding.\nWe ask that applicants submit a personal statement that, in 750 words or less, addresses the following questions:\nWhy are you applying specifically to the mpd² program at Northwestern University?\nHow do you hope to add value to the experience of your classmates?\nWhat are your career aspirations upon completing the program, and how will mpd² help you reach these goals?\nWe also ask that applicants submit a series of short answer responses that, in 150 words or less per question, address the following questions:\nApplicants are asked to submit a recent version of their resume or CV. We encourage applicants to keep their submissions between one and three pages long.\n(Optional for Application Submission, Required for Admission)\nApplicants must provide contact information for at least one recommendation letter writer before submitting their application. After you save their contact information in your application form, recommenders are emailed a link to a brief recommendation form confirming their name, current organization, phone number, and how long they have known you. They can then upload their letter as an attachment.\nWhile many applicants ask their direct supervisors for a letter, they can also come from peers, clients, or colleagues. Recommendations can be from any professional reference who knows you well and can speak to the quality of your work and your abilities, especially in a team setting.\nRecommendations can be processed before or after you submit your application form, but we must have received at least one for you to be eligible for admission.\n(Optional for Application Submission, Required for Interview)\nThe mpd² program focuses on innovative thinking and practical problem-solving. As part of our holistic admissions process, we encourage applicants to submit examples of past work that demonstrate their skills and approach to problem-solving. These examples help us understand your experience, creativity, and potential fit for the mpd² program. Your work samples allow us to understand better how you approach real-world challenges and bring ideas to life.\nExamples can come from your professional career, academic projects, or personal interests. We welcome a variety of formats, such as:\nYour examples need not be polished or perfect—they should simply give us a window into your thinking and how you tackle challenges. This part of the application is optional at the time of submission, but please note that it will be required before scheduling an interview. We recommend submitting them simultaneously, if possible, as having these ready significantly speeds up the scheduling process if you’re invited to an interview.\nIf you're unsure what to submit or how to format your examples, please get in touch with us. We're here to help!\nSome applicants are invited to complete an admissions interview with Program Director Jim Wicks or another member of the mpd² team.\nThe admissions interview is an opportunity for us to get to know you better, for you to walk us through the examples of past work you provided, and for you to ask us more in-depth questions about the program’s curriculum, culture, and community in a one-on-one environment.\nApplicants must submit examples of their past work before they can schedule and complete their admissions interview.\nYou must have earned a bachelor's degree (or the international equivalent) to be eligible to apply for admission.\nWe want our students to draw from real-world experiences when contributing to class discussions and project work. Therefore, we require a minimum of three years of full-time, post-undergraduate experience to be eligible for admission.\nForeign nationals are required to demonstrate English proficiency as part of their application in one of two ways:\nNorthwestern Student Finance publishes the current tuition and fee rates, and Northwestern’s Evanston Office of Graduate Financial Aid provides detailed estimates of the total cost of attendance.\nPlease see Financial Aid.\nDiscuss the mpd² program with director Jim Wicks, faculty, students, and alumni.\nThe mpd² program office will email an acknowledgment once it has received your application form. We will then contact you to schedule your interview at which time you are to bring your product design and development or technical portfolio.\nNorthwestern University does not make decisions related to admissions, including but not limited to financial aid and scholarships, based upon any category protected by the law. The University is committed to complying with all applicable laws.

Each of the courses run five weeks, and the capstone is completed during the final three quarters. Courses are designed for and attended exclusively by mpd² students, and the students progress through the curriculum together as a cohort.\nThe courses range from a wide array of subjects typical of both a) a professional design and development curriculum (product management, understanding through design, obtaining meaning from data, protecting intellectual property, creativity, leading design sprints, design research, and managing innovation), and b) a business curriculum (marketing, finance, accounting, organizational behavior, leadership, negotiation, decision making, and business modeling).The mpd² curriculum incorporates a final Capstone project during the last three quarters of the program. Students research a topic of interest and design a product or service that addresses a customer’s need. This project serves as a practical application of their learning, demonstrating their proficiency through a formal presentation to faculty, venture capitalists and industry experts. Students work with industry mentors and our consumer research platforms on these projects to gain real-world experience and valuable networking opportunities. This hands-on project reinforces the concepts learned throughout the program and gives the students an opportunity to produce a tangible outcome that can have impact on their area of focus.\nSee the 2025-2026 class schedule here.\nAttend an info session / open house\n*Course supports the Capstone requirement.\nUnderstanding the overall process of the design and development of products and services from opportunity identification to realization.\nCommunication within the corporate environment: public speaking, live presentations, reports, and emails.
