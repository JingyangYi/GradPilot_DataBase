Can I study a course online or part-time? Is transferring between courses or universities an option? Associate Professor Amanda White OAM tackles these questions and more, exploring study options, career pathways and some of the opportunities on offer at university.\nhi curious people I'm Dr Amanda white associate professor in accounting at UTS and I'm here to answer your curious questions about studying at University this is uni curious I've got a bunch of questions from our UTS Community about studying at University let's dive in what are the deadlines for accepting an offer or applying for a course this is a really complicated question and so when it comes to applying for a course make sure that you look at the U guide if you're an undergraduate student or the University website for the deadlines around applying for the course that you've interested in when it comes to accepting an offer firstly congratulations secondly make sure you read the offer information really carefully CU that will have all the information you need about deadlines for acception is it possible to study a course online or part-time most of our courses at UTS are designed to be on campus experiences and they have very limited online classes however we do have some ability to study part-time and for postgraduate programs you might want to check out specific courses to see if they're slightly more flexible in terms of online offerings can I get feedback on my application or portfolio unfortunately we don't provide feedback on indiv idual applications or portfolios instead look to your peers friends and family to get feedback on your application just be sure to make sure you remember the application criteria that the university has set to make sure that you're answering all the questions that they are can I defer my offer or course absolutely when you receive an offer you can choose to accept your offer or defer for a period of 12 months unfortunately you can't defer a degree for only 6 months it has to be 12 can I transfer courses or universities transferring courses within UTS or from another institution will generally require you to apply through UA can I change my major or add a second major yes it's always possible to make a change to your study plan the key is to talk to the university you can do so by going to the university in person to a student center or by sending an e- request if you're looking to to add another major will depend on the size and the duration of your degree and how many credit points you've already completed the best thing to do is to go to a student center to get advice from one of our student advisers if you pick a second major does it mean that your course is extended from 3 to 5 years courses that allow a second major will have that built into their structure so you need to make sure that you check your course handbook for the exact information about the structure of your particular course course it will say whether you get to choose one major two majors sub Majors or electives and if you're confused you can always pop in to a student center to make sure that you get the right advice but the handbook is your best bet for questions related to changing your major or the structure of your major you can't simply add another major and extend your time in a course it has a very specific set number of credit points that you're going to need to study can I take accounting electives if I'm studying engineering I love this question because I teach introductory accounting and I love having students from all across the university if your program does allow electives and those electives can be sourced from across the entirety of UTS then you certainly can come and study an accounting elective if you're an engineering student this might also be the case if you're studying science if you're into Health uh design anywhere that you have a free elective that can be studied from across the university you can pick something from any any other faculty do you have any advice for internships I highly recommend internships they're a great way to get experience and to figure out if something that you're interested in is a possible future career path and conversely it's a great way to know that something definitely isn't for you and when it comes to University make sure that you connect with your University career service because they'll have lots of advice on how to get internships where to look for them how to develop your resume and your link LinkedIn profile to give you the best chance also make sure you connect with your clubs and societies on campus Because often information about internships finding out and hearing from other students about their experiences can often happen through different clubs and Society events as well but I'd highly recommend everyone do at least one internship during their university studies and you can find out lots more from your University career service what are the career Pathways available after you study an accounting degree the traditional view is that if you studied an accounting degree you'd go off and become an accountant and there are lots of different accounting Pathways auditing tax working with private clients working in commercial organizations any industry that you can think of they definitely need accountants but you can take accounting information and your accounting degree which is the foundation of business all around the world and use that in software development in Consulting in a creative business our accounting graduates end up in all sorts of different places from being CEOs of publicly listed companies to Tik Tok Superstars there's no limit to what an accounting degree can do for you so that was all the questions for today I hope that you learned something new from our conversation until

But before I do, I should also mention that in the bachelor of communication 2 of their courses are also getting a name change\nThe bachelor of communication and writing and publishing is changing to creative writing, and our strategic communication course is being rebranded as public relations and advertising.\nWhat can I say? We are engaged in teaching students about communications. So for us, words really do matter and mean something.\nSo why the changes? Well, I'm glad you asked\nAt UTS we regularly review and update our courses to ensure that we are offering the best education that we can.\nIt's our goal to ensure that what we teach our students is up to date and future focused.\nWe also want to make sure that we are maximizing your future employment opportunities by teaching you skills that you'll need when you enter the workforce. We want you to be prepared for the opportunities and challenges of tomorrow, such as new and emerging technologies like GENAI.\nThe world is changing fast. So we're changing with it.\nBy revising and rebranding our courses in media arts, animation and music and sound design. We are bringing together our creative production courses under one roof for the 1st time.\nWhile the foundations of each of these degrees will remain largely the same. Offering these courses as a suite allows us to really enhance your education through a more integrated approach\nIn the new bachelor of creative production students will benefit from 3 new common core subjects that they will take together on topics tailored to their collective needs.\nIn this new structure, we will be offering our students the chance to take up to 2 sub majors from the other creative production disciplines or from our friends over in Comms.\nIf you're a media arts student, for example, you might wish to take a sub major in animation, but also one in media business. If you're in music and sound design. You might want a sub major in media arts.\nSubmajors are a chance to acquire another specialization and add a set of complementary skills to your degree.\nFinally, the newly revised courses have been designed to maximise opportunities for our creative production students to work together on each other's projects, and this will culminate in the opportunity to work even more closely together in our specially designed creative production honours year.\nWe've also taken this opportunity to refresh and enhance and embed our already strong connections to industry, and make the most of our location in the heart of Sydney's creative precinct.\nOf course, during this process we have not forgotten about our friends over in Comms.\nOur highly successful and sought after Comms degrees have also undergone a vigorous review, resulting in a new and streamlined structure, a set of refreshed common core subjects and a strengthened commitment to their industry connections. Through our work, integrated learning, framework.\nCreative production students will still get access to communications, subjects, and vice versa. And our students, no matter what course they're in, will get the benefit of our school's broad range of general electives taught by our world-class academics.\nHave you already applied via UAC for one of our current courses for 2026?\nIf so, do not worry. You will not have to reapply. All of our recently reaccredited courses are being updated with UAC and our course codes remain the same\nUpdated course listings with new names and so forth, will be appearing on the UAC website shortly, and also, of course, on our own UTS website very soon.\nIn the meantime, to learn more about these exciting changes to our 2026 course offerings and the careers that they can lead to. There are 2 upcoming opportunities you should be aware of.\nFirstly UTS is holding its annual open day on Saturday, August 30th\nThis is an opportunity to come to UTS to meet current students and the academics who are teaching these courses and ask them the questions that you may have\nOn open day. We will also have, course, info sessions, career panel sessions, where we will be talking about the upcoming changes in more detail.\nSecondly, if you can't make it to open day because you don't live in Sydney, or you just want a little more information before you decide we will be hosting a sneak peek Webinar. On August 21.\nYou can register for open day, and for this special sneak peek Webinar, by visiting the UTS website.\nFor now, though, thank you for listening, we look forward to seeing you at UTS very soon.\nThis video showcases exciting study areas in the new Bachelor of Creative Production, including Music and Sound Design, Media Arts, and Animation. It also features our refreshed Bachelor of Communication degree designed to equip you with the skills and knowledge needed for today’s evolving media and communication landscape.\nBy exploring these degrees, you’ll discover how UTS nurtures creativity and innovation, providing hands-on learning experiences and industry connections that prepare you for success. This is your first step toward unlocking a diverse range of exciting career opportunities — and it all begins at UTS.",

She's also teaching the Industry Aligned Publishing Workshop subject in the graduate certificate program.\nWelcome, Jane. Thank you so much for coming to us tonight. And finally, we are joined by Amanda Esnaola-Kluthke.\nWith over seven years of experience in business strategy and project management, Amanda is currently serving as the co-founder and product manager at Perpetual Hire. Additionally, she is one of the current students in the UTS Writing, Editing and Publishing program. Hello and welcome, Amanda.\nWith our introductions complete, let us delve into the exciting world of writing, editing and publishing. To kick things off, I would like to hear some of your insights on the Australian publishing industry and the current landscapes for writers and editors. Delia, would you mind expanding on that? Well, I think to quote Dickens, it's the best of times and it's the worst of times for publishing at the moment.\nCertainly, people I've been speaking to in publishing are saying it is quite tough at the moment because of rises in production costs and rises in the cost of living, and that is what it is. But on the other hand, I can't remember the Australian writing scene being quite so dynamic, so diverse, so exciting as I've, you know, in my 20-something years of being in the writing world. It's really, there's lots of experimentation.\nThere's lots of hybrid, exciting books and works being written. Non-fiction is booming. Our literature is being noticed overseas.\nWe have an Australian writer on the Booker Prize shortlist at the moment. If you've been looking at the prize lists, Australia's Indigenous writers are, you know, sort of hitting it out of the park at the moment. So, we have, you know, this great energy and people who stay in the industry, you know, really stay in because they love it, because it's a really dynamic and exciting industry to be in.\nThe message that I have had from industry people about writing is that, and about working in the industry, is what they're looking for is flexibility. So, you know, the traditional roles used to have the differentiation between, you know, a publicist and a, you know, publisher and an editor and so on, those roles are getting increasingly blurred. So, you know, they look for candidates who can bring a lot of life skills and a lot of work skills to the table and bring a lot of enthusiasm.\nSo, flexibility, I think, is the way, path forward in publishing and editing and writing at the moment. Brilliant. Jane, it's lovely to have you here this evening and thank you so much for coming out.\nWith a well-rounded experience in the industry, could you share your story about how you transitioned from writing to being a formative editor and into publishing? And do you think it's rewarding for those looking to enter these fields to develop skills across different areas as well? I often feel as though my career has been a series of happy and unhappy accidents, honestly. I wouldn't say I've had a clear career strategy that I've followed. One thing's led to another thing.\nI've had a lot of good luck and a lot of bad luck along the way, as everybody does. I feel very fortunate that I've had such diverse experience across the industry. I've, you know, I've been a writer, I've been a publisher, I've led a major writing organisation, I've been a literary judge, as you said.\nI've worked as an editor and as a translator as well. All of those things have taught me skills that have been useful in all of the others, you know, they've all been enriched by the other things that I've done. That said, I don't think it's necessary for people to work in every aspect of the industry.\nYou know, if you want to be a writer and that's really what you want, you don't have to work as a publisher. What I do think you need to do, though, if you want to build a career as a writer, is you need to really understand the publishing industry. It is, as Delia said, an incredibly dynamic, exciting, creative industry, but it is also a very low margin industry, particularly in Australia where our population is small.\nSo, our readership is therefore small. It is really tough to make a book viable financially in our market, and publishers often say that 20% of the books that they publish support the other 80%, because it's pretty hard. It's pretty tough out there, and salaries in publishing are low as well, and I think probably everybody knows that writers, generally speaking, don't make much money either.\nSo, financially, it's a very difficult and constrained field to be in, but there are many, many other rewards that come with it. Would you say that the flexibility that Delia mentioned, is that something that we can definitely leverage to enhance this industry, especially in Australia where it does seem to be struggling a little bit, but is that an advantage that we can definitely leverage for? Yeah, definitely. Definitely, it is.\nI mean, roles in every industry are changing, and new jobs are emerging all the time. It used to be in publishing that publicity and marketing were very separate fields, and that's no longer always the case, and obviously there are new marketing platforms emerging all the time. BookTok is now a really significant contributor to book sales in Australia, and that's been quite a rapid increase in quite a short time.\nI think if you want to work in publishing, there's lots of advice I could give, but one piece of advice would be not to be too fixated on the job that you want in the end. So, you might want to be a publisher, but you might start out as the receptionist, the admin assistant, or writing publicity material, or whatever it might be. But if you can get into a publishing house, and you're good at your job and you work hard, opportunities will come to you.\nSo, not to be too concerned about what you do, but develop as many skills as you can that are relevant, and be prepared to be very flexible about what you do. Yes, fantastic advice, and I think it's a great segue into the next question would be for Dr. Andrew. Can you tell us about the diverse career opportunities available for graduates in the writing, editing, and publishing program? There are pockets of expansion in the Australian publishing industry at the moment.\nSo, for example, Simon & Schuster, one of the major multinational publishing houses in Australia, have established a new press called Summit Press, and they've acquired a small press firm with the project of expansion. So, there's some good news around as well. UTS graduates have found work at publishing houses in editorial, marketing, publicity.\nSomeone in the marketing department at my publisher, Pan Macmillan, is a UTS graduate. I can think of UTS graduates working at literary agencies, Curtis Brown and the recently established A4 Literary Agency. We don't specialize in script writing, but nevertheless, UTS graduates have written for soaps like Home and Away or dramas such as Mystery Road, and of course, UTS is known for graduates who are novelists.\nWe'll talk about some of those publishing successes later on. I think I would like to definitely expand on that and go towards Amanda now. You've studied our program and I believe that you're currently still in the graduate certificate program now.\nCould you tell us about your experiences so far and what do you enjoy most about the course? Yeah, so I'm on the home stretch now. I have two assignments that I need to hand in this week, so that's exciting. And I'm really sad actually that it's ending.\nI've really enjoyed it. I wasn't sure what to expect coming into it, but I think one of my favorite things about it was just being around a bunch of different people that are all sort of working towards the same thing. You have this baseline shared interest, which is typically writing or maybe it's editing.\nAnd so coming together in some of the writing subjects and doing something called workshopping, which was a foreign concept to me at the time. Basically, you hand in a written draft and then everyone reads your work and then you come back and you get feedback from everyone and your lecturer. And I think that was a very insightful experience, not just from the perspective of receiving feedback, but also giving feedback and listening to the feedback that other people were giving.\nAnd I think just as well, I think we forget our lecturers are published authors. And so being able to speak to these people and get their advice and guidance and encouragement was wonderful. With your assignments, how would you describe your assignments? Are they more practical based focus or are they more theory based? Yeah, that's a good question.\nI think the majority felt very practical. A lot of it was, for me, a lot of my assignments were actually just doing the thing and writing. And then the professional editing subject that I did was very practical.\nWe did one assignment was a copy edit and then another assignment was a structural edit. And that was a fantastic experience. Yeah, so it was mostly practical, I would say.\nFantastic. Now, I understand that the program itself is co-designed with industry partners, allowing students to gain practical learning experience. And this is really the focus and one of the perks of this degree is the fact that there is a lot of practicality in it.\nCould you kindly share how this collaboration happened and how it impacts on student experiences, learning and career outcomes? That question for me. Well, let's not forget that we're all industry people as well. And that is where we have a distinct difference from many other degrees where you might have one or disciplines where you might have one or two people who are publishing.\nOur greatest asset, I think, is our people and our connections to industry. We're business people as well. We have active, busy, successful writing lives across many genres and areas.\nAnd so, part of that set of connections that we have has been the ability to when we… So, we've reaccredited this course last year, which means that we gave it a full sort of, you know, fitness test and a whole set of tweaks. And we were able to call on people in industry. So, the head publisher of Penguin Random House, the CEO of a company that turns books into films, a senior publicist, a couple of other publishers.\nSo, we spoke to them to see what their needs were in industry. And that was very much where we received the… And so, we have those sort of people that we can always call on. We can call on them to come in and visit classes as well.\nSo, we have that very strong industry connection. And the message from them was very much this message about, you know, we really value students who come out of programs like yours because they can think and they can… You know, they have the kind of… It's a people industry. So, they have the cultural knowledge and the cultural skills, you know, that we are looking for as well.\nSo, one of the things that we did as part of that industry advice and connection was to… Well, we already have subjects. We have something called authentic assessment. So, authentic assessment is where we design our subjects so that the end product is as close to something that you would send out into the publishing world anyway.\nSo, for example, in the non-fiction subject that I take, the assignments are designed so that students can just send them out. We've had over 50 students in that subject. We get major publications in major literary magazines, newspapers, and so on.\nSo, that's sort of part of it. But what we did was also retweak the publishing course which Jane has been teaching for us where we made that as close to an intern-like experience as possible. So, students… I'm sure Jane will speak about this, but students are getting industry people in and they are to speak to them and we've partnered with Ultimo Press who are in our precinct.\nSo, they actually hear from a publisher about their list and they deliver a pitch to that publisher and perform other activities that they would and tasks that they would undertake in a publishing company, including the teamwork aspect because it is very much a business of building relationships. Even as a writer, your relationships are super important. That's fantastic.\nSo, essentially, you'll be creating a portfolio through the graduate certificate as well. Jane, would you like to just continue on with the publishing? Yeah, sure. So, in Publishing Workshop, the students have been working in groups to put together a publishing proposal for a particular book.\nAs part of that, they've needed to prepare a marketing pitch for their colleagues in the publishing house to persuade them that this book should be published. They've needed to identify the audience, how many copies they think they can sell, what the price should be. They've done a brief for a cover designer, what the cover should look like.\nThey've done an editorial brief on the manuscript and what changes might be made there or if there are any issues that the manuscript poses. So, they've prepared this whole document in the way that a publisher would do within a publishing house to go to an acquisitions meeting and persuade their colleagues that this book is viable and worth publishing. So, it's been a very practical, hands-on experience for them.\nAnd as Delia said, they've had a number of industry guests coming in across the semester to learn from. So, at the beginning of the semester, they were all looking a bit shell-shocked and saying, but how do we do this? But by the end of the semester, they all felt pretty confident that they knew how you would approach doing something like that. I think something that's very important to know is that as students, we tend to have this mindset that everything needs to be theoretical.\nBut the fact is that, you know, the skills that we learn, those are the real things that we actually need to apply later on in life. And the fact is that the Graduate Certificate Program is designed to be as realistic as possible. It's just absolutely fantastic.\nAmanda, would you like to continue? Yeah, actually, that got me thinking. I'm doing a subject at the moment which has been really insightful in the sense from the industry perspective. So, we've had a lot of online Zoom classes, but meeting industry professionals from, you know, different states as well.\nAnd doing my final assignment at the moment, it's been a really reflective process because we've got to think about, we've got a project that we are working on and we've got to think about where we could get that published and what publisher might want, might suit, might want to publish that kind of story and why. And also thinking about our career as writers more broadly. As it's been discussed, it's not easy to make it as a writer.\nAnd so, you kind of got to think creatively, which I guess that's one thing that we can already do. And yeah, find some other ways around. So, it's been very good to go through that.\nAnd I remember before I had applied to come to UTS, I was looking at other courses available. And, you know, I saw there was one subject at a university that I won't mention. And it was like the writing life, how to be a writer.\nAnd there was a lot of what seemed to be theoretical subjects. And the thing that drew me to UTS was the practicality of everything. So, yeah, it definitely lived up to that from my experience.\nFantastic. Now, I'm going to stick with you, Amanda. Would you mind telling us about the UTS Anthology? What is that? And I've heard that you've done some work with it as well.\nYes. So, we had the book launch last night. So, the UTS Annual Writers Anthology is a collection of short stories, a mixture of fiction, nonfiction, poetry, and sometimes scripts written by UTS students.\nAnd yeah, so, at the end of last year, I applied to be on the committee, not knowing what I was going to get myself into. And thank goodness for that. But yeah, it was last night we had the book launch at the State Library.\nAnd it was flawless. And Delia, I have to say thank you so much for thanking us. We didn't want to make the event about us.\nBut for you to recognize like all the craziness and to see it come out so flawlessly, I'm like this feels like a lie, you know. But it was great. And yeah, you guys can, if you're interested, you can buy, I think you get a copy in your gift bags or something of last year's anthology.\nSo, you'll get a feel for it. But yeah, it was an amazing experience to work as a part of that editorial team. We all worked as editors with our own authors.\nAnd then we all had some other roles to fulfill as well, like organizing the launch. And it was just really amazing exposure to the end-to-end editing and publishing process. And just really nice to be able to work with an author on their own work.\nSo, yeah. Sounds very exciting. Delia, would you mind just building up on Amanda's point about the UTF anthology? Are there any other features of the graduate certificate that contribute to the success of the graduates? And how do we evaluate this? Well, to go back to last night's event, which was just joyous, it was fantastic.\nPart of what students get out of the degree is they make connections not only with industry people, but with each other. And you, as the editorial team, you will have that team of people that you have worked with well, and that you trust, and that knowledge that you carry forward. And you've got a whole cohort that you all carry forward.\nWe have such loyal alumni from over 40 years of this program running, that in the audience was a well-known Australian writer who was in the very first edition, edition 43. And she was there in the audience to support us. And we had students from other, many who have quite high profiles as a result of this degree, who also came to that event.\nAnd it was an event that was attended by the head of writing from Creative Australia, which is the new name for the old Australia Council. And I guess that actually just another positive thing about the writing situation at the moment that I didn't mention is that we actually have, the government has come up with a cultural policy, Commonwealth Government, called Revive. And they are going to be creating a writing Australia board.\nAnd so, some of those issues that the writing community is looking at are hopefully going to be sort of resolved. So, we had a representative, we had the head of writing from there, we had the head of one of the major publishing houses. So, I think that there's what you see on the page and in the brochure, and then there are those intangibles.\nAnd I think that it's those sort of networks and connections that are probably, in some ways, the jewel in the crown of our writing programs. I mean, writing is such a solitary activity, obviously. Creating community is really important, people that you can talk to about a problem that you've got in a story or something you just read, story ideas, people who can read some of your manuscripts.\nAnd that's one of the things that students do at UTS, they build community. Can I add to that? I talked about the workshopping experience earlier. And I think in almost every instance, I would go into that session, hating what I'd written.\nAnd then all it takes is kinder eyes that are not yours, to offer you a different perspective, and then reinvigorate the writing process for you. So, yeah. For those who, just building up on your point, for those who feel perhaps a little bit intimidated with even starting to write, do you have any advice? And I'd like all the panelists to contribute to this.\nPeople who are intimidated to start to write? If it's something you really want to do, then you kind of need to do it. And not worry too much about how good it is at first, you're really just working on your craft. And you shouldn't be thinking at the start, you shouldn't be thinking about, how good is this? When am I going to get a publishing deal? Should I quit? You should just be thinking about ways that you can improve as a writer.\nAnd I should say, we do get that. We've been teaching writing for quite a while, we do understand that it is intimidating. It's hard.\nLook, it's hard for those of us who are writing professionally, sometimes when you're faced with a big project to get started. So, our writing subjects are designed around often, you won't be asked to just here, produce this big, produce a novel for us. You might work your way up to that.\nSo, part of your class would involve writing exercises, and it might be just coming up with lists or coming up with response to particular exercises. So, we give students a lot of what I would call five-finger exercises to practice the skills, and even simulate in some of the more unusual genres. There's an end of creative non-fiction, which is my specialty, that kind of is like a combination of the short story and an essay.\nIt's called Lyric, the Lyric essay. And I give students exercises where they practice some of those kind of poetic elements before they start to put them together. So, we really sort of scaffold the learning with that understanding that writing can be daunting, even for those of us who are four books in, it can be quite daunting.\nI mean, writing is an iterative process, and in these subjects, we take you through some of those early stages in writing a story or an essay. So, now that we've heard from our panellists, I think what we really want to hear now is what is the Graduate Certificate Program? So, the Graduate Certificate is really mainly for two types of people, people who want to publish their own work or people who want to publish the work of others. So, maybe you find it's time to get serious about your writing, you'd like to study it formally, you'd like to learn some narrative strategies, maybe you have a project ultimately in mind, then this is a good degree to start off with.\nOr perhaps you want to change careers, work in publishing and editing or marketing or publicity. So, in the Graduate Certificate, you're developing skills in writing and editing and publishing. So, no matter where you want to end up ultimately within those three coordinates, it helps to know about the other practices and Jane mentioned that briefly.\nSo, if you want to be a writer, knowing something about editing is going to be essential because that's a key process in the production process of a book. You need to understand editing, you need to know that revision is how you make a piece of writing good and you need to know about the publishing process too. Publishing can be an opaque industry and there's so many things that I wish I knew about the industry before I started publishing.\nSo, the more you know as a writer about how the publishing world works, the better you can navigate the industry. For people in editorial and publishing, people who want to work in those areas, it's really good, it's important to understand narrative strategies and traditions. So, an insight into writing craft will make you a better editor or agent or publisher.\nUltimately, everyone in publishing is in the business of storytelling. And then why UTS? Well, you're studying in one of the oldest writing disciplines in Australia. We're always updating our subjects but we're also drawing on a long, long tradition of writing at UTS and our writing degrees have been successful.\nEvery year, two or three novels or works of narrative non-fiction are published in Australia by writers who began those manuscripts during their time in one of our subjects at UTS. And of course, more graduates are publishing their books every year. So, this is a snapshot of the graduate certificate.\nThe degree is designed to be studied in one year. So, one year comprises two sessions. Autumn and spring at UTS we call semesters sessions.\nSo, there'll be more detail on the individual subjects in a later slide. In autumn, you study professional editing in which you're trained as an editor and narrative and creative practices. Another writing subject which delves into narrative techniques for, say, creating good characterization, plot, point of view, among other elements of storytelling.\nIn spring, you study publishing workshop and creative non-fiction workshop. Publishing workshop explores the publishing process and creative non-fiction is a writing subject that guides students through the many forms of non-fiction that are popular today. I'll also mention that we have some Commonwealth-supported places available which means you don't pay course fees.\nSo, please do apply for those Commonwealth-supported places. Yes. So, I think Andrew's given a good explanation of the subjects but creative non-fiction workshop is the subject that I teach at the moment and it's really exciting to teach because creative non-fiction is booming and it is just, it is such a varied field, you know, everything from sort of, you know, fine personal essays through to, you know, quite out there writing and that is actually, commercially, there is, we're seeing that same sort of variety of writing that is, you know, there's been some quite popular hits in terms of creative non-fiction that have been, that aren't, you know, very traditional at all, that are really quite, you know, quite unconventional that are making big sales at the moment.\nNarrative and creative practices is designed around an understanding of storytelling process and professional editing practice is taught, has been taught this year by my colleague Claire Corbett who is the, she's the fiction editor at Overland which is one of the major Australian journals and she takes students through the nitty-gritty of the editing process which is also not just about, you know, sort of marking up errors in someone's work but actually really talking about what the golden vision of, you know, of someone's work is and it's very much about sort of relationships, so students are also learning, you know, how to write a letter to, you know, to an author, how to communicate and exchange knowledge with an author as well and publishing workshop, well you've heard from Jane about how that runs and that's been, I've been hearing fantastic word of mouth from the students in that class. So what can you expect from this course? So in the two writing subjects you will learn techniques from other writers, not just your tutor but the authors of readings as you unpack their craft and read as writers do. So we use a mix of classic and contemporary readings to demonstrate how writers of fiction deploy certain strategies and the exercises and assessments in these two writing subjects are designed to train students in essential strategies for writing dialogue, for managing narrative time, for establishing setting, so and the exercises and assignments mean that you also acquire a writing portfolio if you're not already building one.\nIn the editing and publishing subjects you gain practical experience that trains you in authentic skills that you need in the field. In publishing workshop, Jane mentioned the publishing proposal. So those publishing and editing subjects are designed with current professional practice in mind, including the juggling of many roles that publishing professionals do, say marketing and publicity.\nSo publishing jobs, it seems to me, especially in editorial, require a wide range of skills which you develop in courses such as this one. This is the anthology which we spoke about earlier. How long has the anthology been running, Delia? We have published our 43rd issue this year and for the 40th anniversary a few years ago we published a big bumper edition of the writing that had been published across those anthologies, including writing by authors like Beth Yap or the late Gillian Mears who was one of our very revered Australian novelists who was nominated for the Miles Franklin for her last book, Foal's Bread.\nGillian was a canonical writer who studied here in the late 80s, early 90s? Yes. She was very, very shy and she said she hid for a lot of her degree but nevertheless got her great start. So even great writers again can be intimidated by the process to begin with and I always laugh at that story because, you know, there she was as such a major Australian writer and, you know, she said that she sort of hid a lot of the time for the first year of her degree.\nAnd this year's anthology was absolutely brilliant. I read the whole thing. So well done, Amanda, and the whole editorial committee.\nPlease pick it up and have a read. We also have a Writer-in-Residence program every year. So this year's Writer-in-Residence is Vivian Pham, a novelist.\nPreviously we've had Nadi Simpson, Christopher Rajah, Brie Lee, Christine Piper. So Christine Piper, she was an alumni of UTS and she won the, many of you will know that the Australian Vogel's Literary Award is the best first novel by a young author. It used to be under 35, I think it's maybe under 40 now.\nAnd so, yes, so Christine wrote a beautiful novel, After Darkness, that won that award and she ended up coming back and being a Writer-in-Residence. And Vivian Pham had astonishing success. I think she published her first novel at 21, Coconut Children.\nSo, and the Writers-in-Residence, you know, come and this is a great project where we have a copyright agency sponsorship and, you know, we contribute to the writing community in that way, in that we host a writer with an office and, you know, university resources to work on that notoriously difficult second or third book. And at the same time, they, part of their contract is to be available for student consultations and to come in and make guest visits to classes as well. So we are hoping that that, we've been funded every year, so we're hoping that that continues again.\nBut yeah, and Nadi Simpson's book that she wrote, Bell Bird, has just, you know, has just come out and she's had, you know, blinding success as an author, you know, in the year that she was with us and also since, you know, and this new novel, Bell Bird, I think is going to be very big as well. And the UTS staff. So here we are.\nGraeme Egghurst's, you know, he sits across CAKE, which is the Centre for Advancement of Indigenous Knowledges and Writing, and his young adult novel has just, he's been, he's been to, you know, disappearing to various writers' festivals as a very popular guest all over the country. He's about to go to Singapore with this novel, which is why a, meets fantasy, meets what he calls Indigenous realism, you know, meets, you know, critique of fracking. And so it's a wild ride.\nIt's a fantastic novel. Sarah is a widely published poet. As I said, Claire's, you know, on retreat at the moment.\nShe's been very successful. She's on study leave, coming back next year, and is a board member of Aruna, the Writers' House, which is a residential writers' centre in Katoomba, New South Wales, which runs a huge number of programs for younger writers as well. So we have that lovely connection there.\nGraeme's also on the board of Aruna. There's me, and there's Andrew, and we've spoken about our work as well. Enough, I think, for tonight.\nSome recently published student works. Yes. So am I speaking to this one, or are you? You can speak to this one.\nSo the Calibre Essay Prize is the biggest essay prize in Australia. In fact, people enter internationally. It's run by the Australian Book Review.\nI think they have something like 800 entries. It's huge. And Tracey Ellis, who's a graduate, began her essay, and I said, I think this is one for the Calibre Essay Prize.\nI think you should enter it at some point. And then a couple of years later, she entered it and won. She also took out the Australian Book Review Calibre Short Story Prize in the last few years as well, which is the biggest short story prize in Australia.\nCameron Stewart's novel, White Horses Run, has just come out. Who's the publisher of that one, Andrew? Alan and Andrew. I remember seeing the early chapters of that novel in a class at UTS.\nSydney Khoo's novel, Sydney also started their novel Spider and Her Demons here. That just won the Queensland Literary Awards YA category. And Nadine Cohen's book Everyone and Everything, which she also began in the degree, which is set at the MacLeivers Women's Baths, was Booktopia's, so our major online booksellers, book of the year of fiction or non-fiction debut of the year.\nAnd Brendan Atkins' book, The Naturalist, was a history of the very charismatic and very interesting man who used to head the Australian Museum, was published by New South Press. So, you know, fiction and non-fiction successes. And, you know, there'd probably be, you know, maybe two to three books that come out a year as well as out of the programs, as well as, you know, sort of the many shorter pieces that students have been publishing.\nSo, we're very, very proud of our students here. Admission requirements. So, the application deadlines for Commonwealth supported places.\nThe first round is Sunday, 24th of November, and round two, Sunday, 12th of January next year. So, applicants must have completed a UTS recognised bachelor's degree or an equivalent higher qualification or above. If you don't have a higher education qualification, you can still apply with verifiable professional creative experience in the field, an updated CV, a personal statement, and a writing portfolio of no more than 3,000 words.\nAnd those are the fees. Thank you so much for that detailed overview of the subjects. And I think, correct me if I'm wrong, but the UTS anthology has gone for 40 years now, which, if my maths is correct, is older than the university itself.\nSo, there's really been such a rich and long history of talented writers coming in and out to the universities over the past 44 decades, really. So, thank you to all our guest speakers for sharing their insights with us so far. We're going to open the session now for the audience Q&A.\nSo, and also for all the online attendees, please send your questions through the Q&A function and we'll start taking questions now. What interested me the most is the feedback from people like you. So, will I be writing and you will be, and people, experts will be checking that writing and giving feedback? You would be bringing work in, you would be doing writing exercises in class and getting feedback on those.\nYou would be bringing work in for workshops for the process that Amanda's explained. So, you know, sometimes that can just be a few lines and sometimes that's, you know, that's more substantial work. And you would be getting feedback from your classmates as well as from your teacher.\nAnd that's really important because part of the writing process is critiquing others' work is actually, you know, sometimes the most, you know, the most effective way of learning how to write yourself. So, and then you would, each of these subjects has two assignments and you'd be getting the teacher's feedback on the assignment as well. Now, question from our online audience.\nGiven the, my impression is that there is going to be a lot of change over the next couple of years in the publishing and writing industry. What are some of the emerging skills do you think will be essential for graduates in writing, editing and publishing? That's a hard question. We're definitely, I mean, we're seeing changes across all aspects of the publishing industry.\nAnd it's a little bit hard to predict where some of those changes are going to take us. I mean, obviously at the moment, everybody is talking about AI and what the impact of that might be on the industry. I don't personally think we're at a stage where AI is good enough to make fundamental changes to the industry, but who knows in 18 months, you know.\nI think, you know, publicity always changes. It's constantly changing. That's probably the most rapidly changing part of the industry because there are always new platforms.\nThere are always new ways to reach an audience. Apart from, I mean, some of the skills stay the same, you know, like the fundamental, I mean, we use different technologies for editing, but the fundamentals of good editing haven't really changed. You know, styles change and what the readership has an appetite for changes.\nAnd obviously editing then has to change in response to that. But the techniques of the editor are more or less a constant. So, I think the main thing is just to be learning all the time if you want to work in the industry.\nAnd it's hard to predict. Do you know that the area of publishing that boomed during COVID was audio books? I recorded my book with a small producer during lockdown and they said they could not keep up with the demand. So, you know, the thing is to be, to have that industry interface where you are, you know, in the mix, where you're flexible and you are connected to industry.\nSo, you can kind of, you know, you can be, you know, you can understand changes and be on top of those changes as they come along. The other thing I'd say as a writer is that it's not going to change that writers need to be able to articulate what we do, you know, increasingly well, whether that is, you know, a large, a significant part of writers incomes these days is actually talking at writers festivals or children's authors, you know, often make a really large part of their living by, you know, visiting schools and so on. So, you know, and we need to advocate for ourselves as writers as well within the business.\nSo, having the ability, part of what the workshopping process does and the learning experience here and the classroom experience is that you have to, you know, be able to respond to feedback, to be able to articulate what your vision of your work is and to be able to talk about yourself and about work and others work within the industry. That is probably the most fundamental skill that I think you can take out into the industry. That's such a good point about audiobooks, because some estimates say they're now 15% of the market, which is phenomenal, you know.\nAnd, you know, there's work producing audiobooks. You know, my producer was fantastic. I thought that's actually a really, that's a really interesting job I hadn't even thought of in the publishing industry.\nIn terms of like going into industry, potentially in more publishing editorial side of things straight after the course or kind of as a graduate, what roles are people looking at? Like editorial assistant roles? Is production a big thing in Australia? I mean, like physical book production. And as you were saying at the beginning, with the kind of job market in Australian publishing and the number of graduates kind of thing, I feel like maybe that's a concern coming out. So, I just wondered if you had any advice or insight into kind of approaching that? Yes, I do volunteer, volunteer and volunteer.\nSo, we have had some of our students who've been successful going into industry have volunteered for the Sydney Writers Festival. They've volunteered for the Rose Scott Women's Writers Festival, which we have good connections with. And those sort of, those making sure that they are, you know, they're volunteered for or become part of the editorial collective for Voiceworks, which is the magazine for writers under 25.\nAnd all, so it's, they're the graduates that I have to say are the ones who most get the foothold or they've become really good at, you know, sort of other skills like spreadsheets or, you know, design. So, because the publishers that we spoke to said, look, you know, the more multi-skilled someone is, so don't, you know, the more interesting they are to us and we really value their writing and reading skills. But I think that the more you can get yourself out there, you know, even be communicating, be part of the conversation on social media, all those things are the things that are giving people a step up and, yeah, where we're seeing people, you know, succeed most.\nI would agree with everything Delia just said, but also think about related jobs, like working in a bookshop. If you work in a bookshop, you get a really good sense of what readers buy and why they buy it. And that's an incredibly useful bit of knowledge to bring into a publishing house.\nGot a question over here. It wasn't really a question, it was going to be a comment, because I'm also a student who's about to finish, but I did want to say that Delia and the staff are really good at letting students know when there are opportunities to volunteer. So, that's something to keep in mind as well, because it's not just them saying you should do this, but they actually help you with opportunities.\nWell, after the whole discussion, I think what I gathered is practical things are very, kind of, taken care of in the course. But I would like to ask somebody who has done an undergraduation in English literature, how will this course be still, you know, useful to that person if she's really thinking of, you know, going forward with her writing, or it'll be some kind of a necessary, or it will add on to somebody in the course, because she's already done the course, she's already been exposed to various literature and, you know, writing. So, how this is going to be adding on to her thing and help her as an author? We, look, I think that generally I would say about education is that we're always learning.\nAnd, you know, the sort of, the more I have studied and, you know, I have a PhD in cultural studies, the more I know that I don't know. And knowing what you don't know is actually, and unlearning some things you think you know, are big parts of, you know, I think the central core, fundamental aspects of education. But the connections, again, the connections that you would make with other students who love writing and love talking about writing, a lot of our students, you know, continue to have writing groups that extend beyond the university.\nAnd also, I suppose the thing that we didn't say is very much is that we read a lot as well. So, and that's fundamental to, you know, to writing. And, you know, we encourage students to read part of our, you know, part of each week would be responding to, you know, the, we try to give students diversity in terms of authors and in terms of subject matter and generic approaches.\nBut we also try to give students as much as we can a sort of a depth, a historical depth. So, that's the aim with the sort of the reading we teach you. And the idea is that, you know, that we model that and then students can take again that understanding of, there's always something more to learn, there's always something more to read, but to be able to understand what that is and set yourself, you know, sort of to set goals for yourself and to keep learning is actually what we hope you go away with.\nSometimes every new piece of writing requires new skills as well. As Delia says, you're always learning as a writer. It's perhaps there's some level of mastery that you reach after, you know, eight, nine, ten books.\nBut as a student writer, you know, you really, there's a lot to learn about making a character come alive, managing time in a piece of narrative. I've got another online question and this one's for Amanda actually. I think something that we might all be curious about before entering is what is the workload like and how do you manage the balance between work and study? Well, I think the workload is what you would expect it to be going into a university degree.\nSo yeah, it's a lot of work and I struggled a little bit in my first semester. It had been 10 years since I'd been at uni. I think the best thing that I did that I had to learn over the first couple of semesters was start early.\nStart earlier than you think you need to start and then maybe even a little bit earlier than that. The thing about the course and I guess life in general is you get out what you put in and I don't mean just with time, but like the attention and care that you put into what you're doing. And so I think Andrew and Delia were just talking about the weekly readings.\nSo it's very easy to, you know, if you get inundated and you're running behind on work, you can quite easily skip those. But I would say that would be, that's to your detriment because that's where you learn the most and you bring your own insights and you listen to the insights of others. And if you haven't read the reading, then you don't know what's going on.\nSo yeah, I think just like start early and just really pour yourself into it. We have a question from our online crowd. Again, I'll follow up to the last one.\nGive a ballpark answer. How much time would you dedicate to the degree each week for your studies? Yeah, that's a really hard question to answer. I think I tend to be a slower writer.\nI've had many days where I've looked at a screen and my word count's gone down after three hours. If I had to pick a number off the top of my head, it could be like 15 hours in total maybe. Again, it really depends on how much time you want to spend writing or reading because it's not really, there's no clear end point a lot of the time.\nYou decide that. So I think it's pretty flexible as well. Fantastic.\nWe're onto our last question. We've already discussed the most significant transformations currently occurring in writing, editing and publishing in Australia. Do you guys have one final advice and keep it in one sentence? Keep going.\nKeep reading and support Australian books. I was going to say read too because whether you want to be a writer or a publisher, you've got to be a reader. But I would also say be a good literary citizen, whether you want to be a writer or a publisher.\nBehave decently with other people. Read other people's work. Support other people's work.\nIf you can't afford to buy books, borrow them from the library. If you're on social media, talk about other people's writing as well as your own and you will be rejected. Everybody is.\nTake that gracefully. One sentence. Don't rush.\nWriting is a long game. Footnote. Publishing is a great industry.\nThank you so much for that. That actually comes to the conclusion of tonight's event. Thank you so much to our guest speakers for coming in, the time out and giving us your insights.\nIt's honestly truly been such an insightful event tonight. And thank you to everyone here that came out as well. I'm sure this is something that you're all very passionate about.\nAnd so I actually welcome you all to stay behind to partake with the complimentary refreshments and to network a little bit with our guests as well. For everyone on the online, sorry, unfortunately you can't join us today, but thank you again for attending with us. And again, I just want to remind everyone that the applications are open for the graduate certificate program for this February 17th intake.\nYou can also get more information through the QR code if I can get it up. And we'd also like to get your feedback as well. Sorry, the submissions are through the UTS student portal.\nSo if you're a current student as well, you can also have a one-on-one consultation as well. That's all through the QR code. So thank you again for coming and we hope you enjoy the rest of your evening.\nThank you so much.\nBecome a professional wordsmith and build the skills to launch a captivating creative career.\nCity campus\nCB04 Building 4, Science\nArea 337, Level 6, \n745 Harris Street Ultimo\nNSW 2007\nFree admission\nFree admission\nUTS Tower - Building 1 Foyer\nFree admission\nFree admission\nFree admission\nFree admission\nUTS Tower - Building 1 Foyer\nFree admission\nFree admission\n[GRID_TABLE]\nRead more arrow_forward\nRead more arrow_forward\nRead more arrow_forward\n[CARD]\nAll right.

Before we start the session,\nI would like to acknowledge the Gadigal people of the Eora nation, upon whose ancestral lands our UTS City Broadway campus now stands.\nI’d also like to pay respect to the elders both past and present, acknowledging them as the traditional custodians of knowledge for this land.\nAll right. As we allow more time for the attendees to join us online, I'm going to run through some couple of tips\nfor you to enhance your experience for this webinar. So participants, cameras and microphones have been muted\nto maximize the webinar experience. However, please feel free to ask us any questions\nyou might have throughout the whole entire session. Via the Q&A function at the bottom of your toolbar\nwill also answer your questions at the end of your session. Please note we also have started recording this webinar for educational purposes\nand we'll also share the recording to those registered for this session as well. Thank you very much.\nAll righty. To those who just joined us for the Strategic Communication\nPostgraduate Showcase, my name is Lucas from the domestic recruitment team at UTS.\nSo in this session you will gain valuable insights into industry trends and lucrative career opportunities.\nYou'll also be inspired by personal success stories from accomplished alumni and current students.\nYou will also discover exceptional industry connection and hands on approach.\nAnd last but not least, you will also be able to explore our innovative programs, structured and exciting highlights.\nAnd also we get your answer question, your question answered by our guest speakers as well.\nTo kick us off with this session, I'm delighted to introduce our guests. So we have Dr. Suzanne Kim.\nShe is our senior lecturer and our postgraduate coordinator in the Strategic Communication Program of researchers explores\nhow people's thoughts and feelings impacts their actions in contexts like consumer brand, employee organization\nand citizen governments relationships before academia. She works as a communication consultant at firms like Edelman,\nand then she led and brought up policy as well.\nWe also have JB Van de Casa, so he is our distinguished alumni of the Master\nof Strategic Communication Program at UTS. We have a proven track record in the field.\nHe currently serves as the Communication Engagement Manager at Whitehaven Coal.\nLast but not least, we also have Gabriela Ibarra, so she is our current master of Strategic Communication students\nwho has been cultivating a career in communication and marketing departments both in Australia and internationally.\nPresently she serves as the marketing coordinator for Stark Medical.\nThank you and welcome everyone. So with our introductions completes,\nlet's dive into our exciting world of strategic communication. So hello everyone,\nwhich you guys would like to use the of. So yeah, maybe our staffers.\nYeah. So as I'm being introduced, my name's student Kim. I've been a UTS since 2018\nand I'm currently working as a senior lecturer and coordinator for the Discipline of Strategic Communication and\nas for teaching, I coordinate in P to three subject and I oversee all matters related to our post-crash studies\nwithin our discipline, like the mission study plan, etc.. So if you have an inquiry within our discipline and a duty inquiry\ncoming to me. Let's welcome it. So let's go of Javon.\nYeah. Hi folks. My name's Jason Dekeyser. Yes, ex-student of UW with UTSA.\nSorry and UW. Say I completed my my postgraduate student that is at UTS in Master of Strategic Communications in 2021.\nI've been in the communications field now for about 1314 years, something like that, across a wide cross-sections of little parts of that, from pure\npublic relations to more stakeholder engagement now as well, and currently working up in regional New South Wales for Whitehaven Coal.\nAnd it's a great pleasure to catch up with some UTS people again tonight.\nWelcome and thank you very much. Let's go with you, Debbie. Well, hi everyone, My name is Mark,\nand I studied strategic communication at UBS. Actually, just as a random fact, I graduated\ntwo days ago, so I'm really excited and happy to be here and I started my career at UTC last year in January.\nIt was amazing and I'm very, very happy to be here with you all today.\nPerfect. Welcome, everyone. So let's go with Dr. SIGINT. What is strategic communication and what this program is for\nand like who this firm was as well? Well, there are too many definition\nof a strategic communication dependance culture problem. I was just going to take maybe one definition,\none of the leading scholars in the strategic communication\nProfessor Gans Gardner first and his colleagues. So they suggested strategic communication.\nIs that encompass all communication that is substantial for the survival and success of any entity.\nSo entity could include organization from corporation government and not for propagation\nof social movement and non individuals in the public sphere. So but I guess so in general, maybe if we just say quickly, then provide\nthat communication is understood that proposed poor use of communication via an entity to engage in a conversation with their public and stakeholders\nusing all means from public relation or the marketing branding,\nsocial media and all kind of concept, including campaign and program. Also maybe looking at all kinds of mode, like listening the road\ndialog messaging, arguing, persuading, etc.. So maybe in the past when people maybe\ninterchangeably use the term as maybe integrated a communication.\nThank you very much. Senator James is your alumni\nyou need filled already as well. So in terms of let me have more questions have been like\none of the most intense challenges for communication brand managers, advertising and public relations specialists.\nHow do you see the evolving media landscape impacting the strategies and practices in our field, and what type of strategies\nhave you found effective in adapting to these disruptions?\nYeah, I think it's a great question. And part of the key, the question there is that dissemination of media has really changed.\nI think even it's been very pronounced over the last ten years or so.\nAnd in response to that, that dissemination of media or how media travels Now,\nI think that proponents, I think in the past proponents\nhad far greater control over the narrative. I think\nproponents now say that they have a reduced amount of control over the narrative. They've got to become part of the narrative, and now also consumers\nof products of that of external stakeholders.\nThey now expect a higher degree of engagement from the proponent as well.\nSo I think I remember very early on in my career, it sounds strange even talking about, you know, that I'm years ago, but\nthe default position was we could control the narrative, we'd write a media release\nif we wanted to disseminate a story or create that ad idea. We write a media release and we publish it.\nAnd then we owned the story and it was there was a relatively strong position that that we believed we could control the narrative pretty easily that way.\nBut the reality is very different now, I think, to the greater part Are we as an icon?\nYou know, we're kind of in the work that I do. We see our narrative, our ownership of the narrative as having declined.\nAnd to be honest, I think that's a healthy thing. I think it's healthy for all of society.\nNot to say that we don't want to have ownership of that portion of the narrative, but generally I think we accept that we're part of a bigger narrative now.\nAnd whether that's an ESG narrative, a power narrative, a good versus evil narrative, etc., there are bunch of narratives out there.\nIf you choose to do study at UTS, you'll discover more about narratives and how they shape the world that we're in.\nBut I think proponents now accept that they're part of these narratives. So the question becomes now not how do we control the narrative,\nbut how do we operate within that narrative? Have we got a worthwhile proposition within there? And it's important to remember that, you know, I'm not talking in whole terms.\nThere's areas of grain between total ownership of the narrative and total surrender to the narrative. I think we're somewhere in between those extremes.\nWe've got the opportunity to shape it along along the way as we go. So I guess what have I seen?\nWell, in response to the changing media landscape, there are several tools that that I use that that we've had to adapt.\nAnd that will we'll have to we'll have to keep on adapting. I think we'll have to give more to people.\nBut for me, in response to owning less of the narrative means that I have to do a lot more footwork.\nI actually have to get out there and talk to people more. So I've worked on on industry and megaprojects for the last decade,\nand I think you can really see across Sydney that I'm builders and government have realized that they need to talk to a lot of people.\nSo there's a there's a common theme out there all across New South Wales that I would call a triple, say a community consultative committee\nwhere where companies are willing to take on board feedback from the community and to hear from the community.\nCompanies are now expected to have things like open days where you can involve invite the public to come.\nAnd a lot of what's happening there is it's a response. Well, it's an attempt to get on the front foot before social media captures an event to be\nto be engaging on social media as well as a huge part of what happens so that you can start to get your positive stories out there\nwhen whether that be with your open day or your consultative committee, invite, involve, involve people and engage on social media.\nI think has even changed in the last two years where we're seeing a lot more kind of humorous content happening.\nPeople are being willing to be vulnerable. You know, you see corporations starting to have a personal side. They're as well.\nAnd one I guess one last thing that I'd say that we've found really helpful is to develop advocates in a changing media landscape,\nbecoming part of the narrative means you don't want to be saying your position all the time. You might have other people to help.\nYou have your position also. So if you can develop advocates there, so I've done this on\nprevious projects that we worked really hard to get, say, a business community or community leader onside with us so that when an announcement comes out,\nthey are the person posting on LinkedIn or Facebook or whatever it might be, so that it's not necessarily just our brand. So\nyeah, but some of my thoughts on that. But yeah, happy to keep on discussing through the through the evening as well.\nEarth, I thank you very much, Debbie. Liz, you just graduated two days ago.\nFirst of all, congratulations. And then right now you are one step closer to Joe and Phil.\nAnd then like as you're working in what the sector is in terms of you as like the most recent students\nhere on his share a little bit about your experience with the M.A. degree in Strategic Communication and how that degree\nhas contributed towards your career journey. Yeah, well, first of all,\nI want to tell you a little bit about what I was doing before I came here, and this study was strategic communication because I think it's quite interesting.\nSo I studied graphic design. It's, you know, it's a different area.\nAnd when I was studying, I realized that I really liked to see and understand people.\nSo to talk to people, to understand what I was going to tell, to tell them and everything.\nAnd through that process and my creative process is always multiple people, right?\nSo after a while, I discovered that I really like the part of the communication from all of that.\nAnd just after my bachelor's degree, I started working in internal communications,\nwhich was my first door to the communications world. And after some years of working there, I realized that I really,\nreally, really liked to understand people, to communicate with them, and then to understand a little bit about what we were discussing before.\nSo that's why I decided to study strategic communication.\nAnd well, it's been it was actually great. I think it was something that gave me a lot of skills.\nRight now I'm working it. I'm working in marketing so as you can see, it's a little bit of a change for me as well.\nBut it opened the doors to see how I was able to integrate all the activity that I was building and that I built through the\nthrough the years before. And then with the career of strategic communication, I was able to integrate that into understanding public engagement\nand many other things that are now useful for me in my career.\nSo it was actually great. We had not to say a lot of spoilers, but we had a lot\nof courses that opened my mind, a lot into understanding different kinds of publics, for example, and\nalso into theories which are really important and now I use and also I had a one course that it's been helping me\nin my workplace right now, which is to understand publics to\ndo everything from research to how to create an interview or a survey, and then how to take\nthat information and create strategy days and everything. So the skills that you gain from strategic communication are skills\nthat you're going to use in the future in whatever field you pick\nand whatever you want to do later on, which can be marketing public relations, it can be anything.\nThe yeah, the sky's the limit. Amazing. And like I can see that you are also very excited for like everything as well.\nYeah. In terms of like how can academia and industry collaborate together to ensure that the education and training\nindustry needs and like looked at can students and professional gain from such collaboration less?\nYeah. Does this again what do you think about that.\nI will actually probably see to within I know what's happening behind the scene\nlike when we exited the curriculum the actor who takes a couple of years, but in general when we design put good program and we actually have to conduct\nboth external and in Congress stakeholder consultation. So for example, as a postgraduate coordinator,\nI'm in charge of our program accreditation internally or externally.\nSo so I usually would invite industry\nexpert to review our program and then I Kondo, you know, views and then to understand and the what kind of expectation they had\nfor our master level data and then what kind of skill set.\nAnd nowadays they're actually looking into our actually graduate\nso they actually ready to work so and I was I actually\nconduct internal stakeholder interviews with the alumnae and also for CEOs.\nI couldn't see you doing that well. And I try to understand what students expectations are, their needs or their concern.\nAnd then based on both internal and stakeholder consultation as a discipline, then our faculty member actually brainstorm\nand how we can actually address all needs from internal and external stakeholders,\nyou know, needs. And so there is kind of a beginning process, but then\nI guess so we also continue to work with the industry partners.\nSo sometimes just sometimes to informally or sometimes formally, just a networking\ninitiative. And so we actually also try to understand and how we can actually bridge the gap.\nBut any control is a process and our aim is that our student\nshould be trained to meet industry expectation and so that when they graduate, they are ready to demonstrate their\nnot only industry level skillset, but also theoretically informed\nthe knowledge that might be helpful for their next journey.\nSo it could be, you know, suitable for maybe only career starter,\nlike a like a gave you, for example, like Uber and you know the job is in that probably communication lady but\nyou actually wanted to change your career and you have passion for communication and also you could have actually made a career\nprofessional and if you actually want to specialize in certain area or want to move up to the next level for example,\nor even like a some senior level, like, you know, they already quite experience in their career, but they probably wanted to start up their own\narea, like, for example, or even open their own consultancy, etc.. So our program actually has been really,\nyeah, a meeting of the diverse student body so far. And then I think I have to say that\nwe have been addressing different needs of different student body.\nBut thank, thank you very much. And we also often to talk about like career pathway and like whether Gabby\nwould follow the same pathway or a different pathways. So Gabby, what career pathways and roles\nthey like are emerging in the field right now and like, how can current students and like newcomers\nprepared in some ways to excel in these role, in your opinion? Well, in my opinion,\nso more than New, new careers or roles I'm going to talk about.\nSo one thing that I actually was cared about before I came into strategic communication, which was to start looking at A.I.\nfor example, or other digital things that are now like you know, ruling the world.\nSo as Devin was mentioning before, everything evolves so fast\nand that means that you have to be learning constantly and leaving these these fears just behind and just keep\nkeep walking and keep learning from from these new things that are happening. So in that sense, I think that career was great because it\nopened my eyes a lot into the new things that were going on right now. And we had a couple of projects, for example, where we had to integrate A.I.\nin our communication strategies and that exercise of learning and reading and, you know, like talking\nto people who are in these digital areas in the industry really helped me to understand where we were going.\nAnd also if I wanted to be part of, you know, this digital\nworld that we are living right now, and I think that's quite, quite interesting and quite important for us just to keep,\nkeep learning and yeah. Thank you, Gabby.\nDevin, do you have anything to add as you are writing up in the industry? And then like the experts in this field as well,\nI can't hear you driving.\nI know. Let's maybe try again.\nOr what about those messaging? Like, let's just come back to you later. Can Yeah.\nDo you have anything else to add in from Abby Agaves? Maybe.\nI would just say like because in general, some sorry to my ask lockdown rules actually\nwe are going to get after graduation from UTS, for example. And I would say,\nyes, I would I would love to talk more about like emerging roles and jobs, etc.\nSo even JP needed doing community engagement.\nSo I would say like since pandemic employer communication engagement became more important than before.\nAnd I also think maybe all Oaklanders\nare becoming very popular in the job market. So who can understand, you know, be doing landscaping,\nSyria and social media technology and etc.. So and then I guess\nalso for the community engagement becoming really important\nregardless of the industry, like whether it could be, you know, big corporation like orchestral or it could be a government agency, etc..\nSo looks like based on the consultation, I had with the industry expert and again,\nI keep talking about how we can actually engage with the specific engage\nthose communities like a vulnerable communities and then how we can actually nail those. And but industry experts are kept talking about like there are certain\nfundamental skills and they actually looking into our youth graduate. So for example good skill and understanding and finding the insight\nand how to use data and how to how to formulate a strategy and action\nplan based on the data inside, etc.. So that is quite important.\nSo many industry experts kept highlighting those area, but I personally, just as a scholar and a teacher,\nI to to highlight that our seed on this would need to understand that communication is not just to create something fancy image or impression of your organization.\nYou're working for a client. So I guess more importantly, it's actually all communication strategy\nshould be based on understanding your audiences, stakeholder and publics, and then those sorts of insights should inform\nyour organization's decision making and strategy formulation.\nSo I think that's what we actually tried to cover in this program and now hoping\nwhen our student graduate from our post-grad degree and then so\nI hope that they actually get this understanding on the same page and then so they actually can reflect those in their noodle or see in the future.\nYeah. And like doesn't the academic staff have things to work on as well for JB?\nAnd I think, you know, Mike Face, can you hear me right now? I can hear you. Can you hear me? Perfect. Yes, I can hear that.\nAll right. So I would just redirect back to you as you are the experts and this notice.\nWell, yeah, anything else that like we can actually work on so that like new students, the current students or like newcomers,\ncan prepare themselves to excel in these roles. For sure.\nI think one of the big things that I look for now when I'm hiring is so there's something that's really stuck with me\nfrom my postgraduate studies, actually, that communicates and is dialogic. It's two ways\nto communicate. You actually have to be really good at listening as well. You have to be able to take on board. So when I ask people about how they communicate\nand what their underlying strategies about how they communicate now, often my eyes prick up when somebody says that their first step is to listen.\nThat's always really exciting to me to to hear somebody say that. So I'm always on the on the hunt for people who are good at listening.\nAnd then and then the flip side of that is to to to send the signal well, as well to do the communication well.\nSo I'm always looking for people who are able to distill complex ideas down into easy to understand and yet true statements and writing.\nSo definitely what Sujan was mentioning there about writing skills is key to be able\nto express complex ideas in a way that lots of people can understand very easily, is a vital skill in communications, are always looking\nfor those kind of roles. I mean, it's fascinating as well in terms of career pathways from here.\nI mean, 10 to 15 years ago, corporate communications and stakeholder engagement and community engagement,\nI think we might have lost JB in here. Yeah, we'll move on to next parts.\nSo being on to like what we discuss about the communication industry, I would like to you introduce Dr.\nSurgeon and invite you to illustrates how our programs at yes respond to industry demands and prepare aspirating strategy\nas strategic communication professionals see this for success.\nSo I just share a screen right hand over to you, Dr.\nCision. Yeah, actually, I also see some questions that are waiting for us, and so\nwe are going to answer the question later after I briefly introduce our program.\nSo our postgraduate program is delivered by a combination of senior academic researchers.\nAnd I would say many of us are award winning teachers and we also have\na leading industry professional attitude us and then many our teaching team members have\nalso rich industry experience, including me and I also would like to say\nthat many of us are actually global scholars at the same time. So, for example, distinguished Professor Jim McNamara is a leading scholar\nin evaluation, measurement and organizational listening. He is the author of several books\nand I also like to say that in general, our approach to learning\ncombines practical knowledge and the experience with the theory\nand the critical thinking, and that that you can identify best practices and problems\nto help you raise and address important question issues and such. And recently, one of the issues that we have to pay\nattention to is like ethics and sustainability, diversity, inclusion, and also innovation and creativity and communication\npractices and stakeholder engagement, culture and size. So you can name and one and there were so like digital\nmedia and technology, etc.. So I think when we did the interview and then many people said like,\nwhat is the, you know, the carbon mind image of beauty as it's actually a practical and innovation.\nAnd so so I can highlight that\nwhen you come to UTSA, pursue a program you will enjoy today, industry insight and that talking opportunity.\nSo in general we actually collaborate with collaborating with industry experts.\nSo coming from like a guest lecture and the panel discussion or industry project, so in general, that's what we do.\nAnd probably I maybe in this fire probe, I may mention that like even though\nlike when we start redesigning our program,\nso probably may take a few years. But thing is that as a discipline and we're still considering\nthe nature of the communication and then the nature of our industry in general and everything changes so quickly and that we actually try to keep,\nyou know, update our teaching materials and lectures and so on. So if that yeah, because our passion then that's easily like a text\nthat is actually easily you can identify actually what went wrong.\nAnd so I, I'm actually proud to say that our teaching team actually\ndoing their best to provide up to date their industry trend for our student\nbut I guess so for that but\nI think at the Cabi or the maybe Gabe mentioned on the air, then I go, we need to keep up to the all the industry trends and so on.\nBut I would say, like Lani said, call on experience. So we actually see our SAB as a positive leader\nand then so we actually work together and then to try to understand\nlike what's the meaning and implication of those industry trends inside for our connected practices\nand then to try to actually foster care, critical, critical thinking instead of\nwe actually feeding the knowledge in a one way\nteaching process to our student? Next slide.\nAnd so I would like to you to consider our push good program, and I'm pretty sure you're going to enjoy your new career journey.\nSo there are many ways that you can actually maximize your own campus experience at UTSA from pure collaboration\nand networking opportunity to and interacting with your teachers. And we also closely working with industry professionals and clients.\nThere are sort of many opportunities. So for example,\nin subject that I coordinate, for example, and the be in pipeline to give us the brief and probably maybe\nexpressed that last semester. So clients are happy to give our live brief and\nyou don't need to respond to a client preparedness. Literally, you are brand new and just a recent issue\nthat actually they are actively working on, they really wanted to hear our seed and insight and then so by working together\nand actually see it and actually enjoy the whole experience of addressing client challenges, but actually kind of feel the benefit\nof working together with UTC then and probably J.B. may maybe they later, maybe they're doing that.\nAnd in general, when you have a UTSA post-grad degree and it actually adds a strong impact on your CV\nand you also feel that our faculty members really care about you and that we are creating invaluable experience for you.\nSo probably later other panels maybe adding that thought and next piece.\nYeah, so let me put it. We talk about our postgraduate program, so we have a master\nof strategy communication. It takes a one going five years at full time. But if you fill Loredo by your what come in\nand balance with your study and you can also consider part time. So it could be up to a two year, five year and so on.\nI have seen some had some student taking to subject only and others taking one, etc.\nSo then obviously if you take the last subject and it may take a little bit longer and the we have a total of six core subjects.\nSo each subject takes a creative point. And so we\nour core subject are important, important foundation for the course.\nAnd then so probably I would be we don't have time to explain or\ncore subject, but I probably named just to mention like some of the fundamental theory,\nsomething called exploring human communication. And we also have\nunderstanding and engaging audiences and, and then we have influence in the digital world.\nAnd so we here probably we are looking at wide ranging impact with these to come to technology\nand the video focus how how various industry practices\nor institution have been significantly transformed by those challenges.\nAnd then our student will analyze the most compelling\nand challenging phenomenon in contemporary communication\npractices and the reasoning recently. Maybe I am like a meaning\nof communication practices and the ethics and the impact of social media influence, etc..\nSo yeah, just a few I could imagine. And as I mentioned earlier, so with the other subject\ncalled Managing Public Communication, we're actually doing long ethical frameworks and then they also have cash to create\ncorporate social responsibility and sustainable sustainability proposal and to respond to clients who live brief\nso that just to name a few and but that we have actual full information or our handbook\npage and next page. But and so\nif you you are not sure like if you're not ready to commit go so probably maybe you just start with these\nactually create a diploma in strict communication it's a total\n48 credit points. So it takes a one year free time or you can still aptitude to do part time.\nSo you may take a 1.5 to 3 years or so, again, depending on how many subject you are going to take.\nAnd again, core structure is where you are going to take six subjects.\nYeah, multiply by a point that will make a 48. So you are going to take a four course object and a two elective subject\nprobably here before moving on. Probably some of you guys may wonder like\nthen if we have a core and the what an active subject. And so probably I just would like to keep just so maybe one or two example\nand one of them was a popular elective subject. It and crisis communication.\nAnd as an expert the role of effectively communication in relation to issue in crisis.\nAnd you know for organization, survival or sustainability.\nSo see to examine case studies and or the best and the worst practice to\nto understand and how issue can go into crisis\nand then what the strategic communication do in resolving\nand the crisis, how to manage the reputation of organization, etc.\nand what is maybe the other subject\nmaybe I want to introduce here is creativity and innovation in communication. So here the seed on our\nyeah, going to be introduced to high level creative and conceptual\nthinking and innovation and probably could be very challenging subject, but\nI think many see it on later come to me that actually there was actually quite\nhow crazy it does it quite interesting subject that where you can actually learn\nmulti disciplinary really multidisciplinary theoretical lenses to solve a communication problem.\nSo in general when we say communication, communication is quite broad and but thing is actually then means actually there are many issues\nand that we actually can approach using communication perspective. And so so here probably we are expecting feet\nas a problem solving skills and critical thinking and how to. Yeah\nhow to generate solution for like a kind of without problem.\nSo that is one of quite popular interesting elective subject as well.\nAnd of course we also have a stakeholder engagement, I'm pretty sure many, many process to see you tonight to interesting\nhow we can actually understand and apply the concept of stakeholder engagement into many practices.\nAnd then maybe also we try to\nmaybe explore the some of the key concept. And obviously when we talk about engagement,\nthen we also need to think about this engagement and the non engagement and then as if the some stakeholders\nnot to decide not to engage and then what to behind. And so we need to look at like a publics motivation\nand initiative and trust toward the government or cooperation etc..\nSo the problem with that is yeah, my description for that subject.\nBut anyway, so, but there was kind of a background information beyond this massive program and great diploma in strict communication.\nNext. Yes. Thank you very much. Dot decision. In terms of emission requirements, we have two options.\nAs I mentioned within the Strategic Communication Postgraduate study that you can choose from.\nWe have the Master of Strategic Communication and the Graduate Diploma in Strategic Communication.\nPlease note applicants must have completed a UTS recognized bachelor's degree\nor an equivalence high qualification or above. So for the master of STRATCOM, please note the bachelor's\ndegree must be in the AEC said field of Education management or Commerce\nSociety in Culture and Creative Arts. However, if the Bachelor degree is not in one of those specific fields,\napplicants must also submits a personal statements and a CV for applicants with a master graduate\ndiploma or graduate certificate of qualification. The qualification can also be in any other fields\nin terms of graduate diploma in Strategic communication, your bachelor's degree can be in any fields of the study.\nIf you haven't completed any higher the qualification, you can still apply but with a personal statement and his CV that highlights why\nyou want to pursue this course and the capacity of undertaking this higher education and qualification\nin terms of our intake for autumn 24 is actually open, so classes will be commencing on the February 19th\nand here are some of the key dates that you can see. So for domestic students, the 28th of June\nwould be your deadline for international students. If you are out of Australia, it would be 30th of November\nif you are in South Australia but you also are international students, then the deadline for your application would be the 15th of December.\nWe also recognize prior learning as well. So all of the recognition of prior learning would be reviewed by case\nby case basis after each applicants submit their application. We also have financial support options that meets\nthis available for Australian citizens. These in special category visa holders\nand humanitarian visa permanent residence as well. In terms of if your duty as alumni, you can also enjoy a 10% discount\nfor these for non CSP fee paying courses. We also have scholarship unavailable for both domestic\nand international students and to assist with educational expenses as well.\nSo that's a thank you very much to everyone. So that also bring us to our question and answer session.\nSo we are now open for any questions, if you have any, and you can just check in the queue in a box in the bottom of your toolbar on the Zoom interface\nand then we'll get starts with a question to you. Dr. Cision.\nOkay. So what sort of industry experts of this post-graduate course,\nlike did you consult for this designing course and you need to consult them in how to update your teaching material.\nIn that case? So I think, yes, some of the questions from Q&A.\nSo I think, as you know, if you actually ask the same question for how to update our curriculum, etc.,\nin general as a subject coordinator. So, you know, we are expected to update every session.\nSo we actually have to go through and make sure the our content are up to date.\nSo when I talk about rehabilitation or occupation and curriculum redesign takes off a year\nthat is actually looking at macro level, the edge, micro level. So at a subject level and we don't need to subject you,\nit's actually responsibility to update their learning materials per session.\nPerfect. In terms of have you got any recent examples of interesting projects that you have been engaged with?\nAnd then do you have like a broader discussion of STRATCOM in this industry?\nYeah. Dr. Sajjan Yes, I'm muted here and probably I would like to mention a few projects\ndone by our discipline members rather than mine. So maybe I would like to start with\nour distinguished professor Jim and Nomura. So Jim McNamara specialized in,\nas I mentioned earlier, in measurement evaluation that we're going to show this name.\nAnd since pandemics are only 2020 and, the he had led actually World Health\nOrganization, W.H.O., so COVID 19 communication effectiveness. So he had taken that global approach.\nAnd then yet I think still the project is going on.\nAnd then he also has been working with multiple Australian government bodies and also for\nthe global level. So he I believe that he's working with the OECD.\nSo we're going to Asian for Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\nSo open government you need for public communication. So because he's leading research in that area,\nhe actually did write a book and the many are partly to publication. It was a part of our actually\nreading material. So it could be mandatory, could be recommended depending on the subject requirement.\nAnd another example is actually Dr. Kadir Most, our current head of discipline.\nSo she is an expert and risk issue and crisis communication. And recently she was invited by NSW Premier Department, NSW\nto present her research findings about the social impact.\nAnd now it was actually about the volunteering, you know, during the disaster,\nduring the crisis, like for example, like a bushfire and other digest. So we acted based and then so looking into community resilience\nand then so our project recommendations are going to be included in open inquiry for, for NSW Government\nand especially focused on disaster management. And then so that that kind of finding\nis going to be linked to her subject. We dive into issue and crisis communication.\nAnd maybe lastly, Dr. Flora, that's okay.\nShe's another global level, a renowned scholar in the area of corporate social responsibility\nand stakeholder engagement and communication. And she does.\nShe also has been actively working with agencies and organizations,\nEdelman Public relations worldwide and in some of the research findings, yeah, it can be also used in our\nclassroom setting and for example, for, I imagine, public communication.\nAnd then when we call BER corporate social responsibility and sustainability, and sometimes it appears\nthat part of the most recent research funding of Kuala Lumpur and quite informative for our student learning.\nOkay, perfect. Thank you. I would just us a quick question to Gaby first\nand share a bit of your experience in terms of your job placements and career growth and any unique opportunities\nthat came in your way up to like right now graduating from the program? Oh yeah. Recently.\nYeah, I want to I'm one of you 100% honest with you now.\nAnd the thing is fact that I'm an international student, I thought it was going to be very difficult for me to find a job\nand it wasn't. So the reason it wasn't it was because of all the skills that I've learned through these career.\nAnd this is like me being 100% honest. And that loss, of course, some skills that I had before,\nBut it was actually a really good experience for me. When I was looking for a job, I could find a job in\ninternal communications first, which I really enjoyed, and that opened me the doors to the medical industry, the health industry here in Australia\nand now I'm in in a job where I'm the marketing coordinator\nfor a company that sells medical devices and instruments.\nSo that is an industry that is not as easy to get in as other industries.\nAnd for me it was actually a very good experience. All the opportunities\nof speaking to different professors, academics and classmates and everyone who was around me\nactually gave me a lot of perspective on how should I, you know, approach career growth and job hunting.\nAnd it was it was very good. Well, perfect.\nAnd then like, what's your like support system at UTS during your time studying all that resources or maybe mentoring opportunities\nthat you found the most beneficial during your time at studying this program?\nWell, I look at some things really simple as going to study on campus was great for me.\nThe resource of having the the small rooms, the computer, or all the spaces that I needed.\nI really like to concentrate fully when I'm studying, so I rather go and do it at university.\nAnd that was a great resource to have. Then from my internship opportunities\nfirst mentors program in UCAS, where you can look for a mentor and you basically put your profile there and then you read the\nthe mentors profiles and then you can find yourself a mentor, which is great that someone in the industry.\nAnd then something that worked really well for me was as well to\ntalk to the professors. I really enjoyed that. That was one of my favorite things. And I had one professor whom I really, really enjoyed talking to.\nI felt like she really helped me to understand better what I wanted to do, like in the long term.\nAnd I think, yeah, that, that relationships that you build through your career are really, really important.\nProfessors, classmates, people, university academics,\nand as well as people in the industry who sometimes you meet through a class.\nYeah. Yeah, perfect. Thank you very much. And with that last question, we'll\ngo and bring this session into your close. I would like to extend grants you to our guest speakers,\nGabby, Javed and also Dr. Sajan, for sharing in oppressive insights into every single involving trends\nwithin the Australian communication industry, as well as the call to opportunities offered by the Strategic Communication Program.\nAnd it's for our audience here.
