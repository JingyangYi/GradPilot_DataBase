The University is also able to accept UKVI approved Secure English Language Tests (SELT) but we do not require a specific UKVI SELT for degree level programmes. We therefore still accept any of the English tests listed for admission to this programme.\nPre-sessional courses\nThe University of Glasgow accepts evidence of the required language level from the English for Academic Study Unit Pre-sessional courses. We would strongly encourage you to consider the pre-sessional courses at the University of Glasgow's English for Academic Study (EAS) Unit. Our Pre-sessional courses are the best way to bring your English up to entry level for University study. Our courses give you:\n\ndirect entry to your University programme for successful students (no need to take IELTS)\nessential academic skills to help you study effectively at University\nflexible entry dates so you can join the right course for your level.\n\nFor more detail on our pre-sessional courses please see:\n\nPre-sessional courses\n\nWe can also consider the pre-sessional courses accredited by the below BALEAP approved institutions to meet the language requirements for admission to our postgraduate taught degrees:\n\nHeriot Watt\nKingston Upon Thames\nMiddlesex University\nManchester University\nReading University\nEdinburgh University\nST Andrews University\nUCL\nDurham.\n\n \nFor further information about English language requirements, please contact the Recruitment and International Office using our enquiry form\n[CARD]\nBiological & Biomedical Sciences\nAnimal Nutrition [MSc/PgDip/PgCert/CPD: Online distance learning]Animal Welfare Science, Ethics & Law [MSc]Applied Conservation Science [MSc]Applied Neuropsychology [MSc(MedSci)/PgDip]Bioinformatics [MSc/PgDip/PgCert]more related Biological & Biomedical Sciences programmes\n[CARD]\nBiomedical Engineering\nBiomedical Engineering [MSc]Clinical Trials [MSc/PgDip/PgCert]Industrial Biotechnology [MSc]Medical Devices Engineering [MSc]more related Biomedical Engineering programmes\n[CARD]\nMolecular Biosciences\nBiomedical Sciences [MSc]Biomedical Sciences [MRes]Biotechnology [MSc]Biotechnology & Management [MSc/PgDip]Cancer Pathology and Advanced Technologies [MSc]more related Molecular Biosciences programmes\n[CARD]\nPharmacology\nClinical Pharmacology [MSc(MedSci)]Industrial Biotechnology [MSc]Precision Medicine [MSc]Science Communications [MSc]\n[CARD]\nRelated links\nTaught degree programmes A‑ZHow to apply for a postgraduate taught degreePostgraduate research opportunities A-ZHow to apply for a postgraduate research degreeFees and funding\n[CARD]\nPostgraduate events\n\nOpen Days, information sessions, campus tours, events near you\n[CARD]\nKeep in touch\n\nSign up for latest information",
