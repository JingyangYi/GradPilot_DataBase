EDI students are engineers who like to create new things, are comfortable with problems that are hard to pin down, and care about culture and contemporary context. At EDI, we introduce you to design thinking, a process of user observation, visualization, rapid prototyping, and iteration. Learn more\nRequest Info How to apply\nFrom design consultancy to healthcare to technology, EDI alumni are creating change across industries. As engineers who deeply understand design innovation, they are ready to make a difference upon graduation.\nOur unique curriculum has a laser focus on the integrated design process. You’ll blend analytical skills and creative thinking to develop whole-brain practical solutions for real problems.\nOur emphasis on team-based projects fosters interdisciplinary collaboration within the EDI program. As an EDI student, you’ll benefit from our strong ties to design innovators at Northwestern, in Chicago, and beyond.\nOur faculty, advisers, alumni, and current students hail from some of the top companies in the United States. Learn more about the leaders and innovators affiliated with our program.\nMeet our people\nEDI empowered me to shift my focus from physical product design into a broader view of the entire user experience. As a result, I'm a more well-rounded experience designer and am able to have more positive impact on our users.\nEDI taught me the crucial factor of designing a product: put people first and fulfill their needs. After EDI, I am confident that I have become an empathetic product designer.\nI learned how to separate feelings of failure from the valuable lessons that failures teach. During my time in EDI, I developed the confidence and drive to welcome unexpected results and continue to grow as a person and designer.\nThe EDI program was characterized by 15 months surrounded by the most talented, bright, driven, and inspiring individuals I have ever met. Solving countless problems with innovative solutions has provided my peers and I with the tools and strategies to live a successful personal and professional life.\nThe EDI program gave me the tools to reimagine the design process as an exploration of humans needs. Not only am I a better engineer, but I am now confident in my ability to change the world.\nDuring my time in the EDI program, I was encouraged to explore, experiment, and build at the intersection of human-centered design, engineering, and business strategy. The people, methods, and tools I worked with cultivated my entrepreneurial spirit and aptitude for connecting disciplines to create better human experiences and services.\nBeing a part of EDI allowed me to try out different careers, like being a product designer or an interaction designer, to better understand what aspect of design I wanted to pursue.\nI want to bring design straight to the hands of patients and clinicians in the world of healthcare in a dynamic way that these people deserve. EDI has given me the skill set and determination to unapologetically work towards this goal.\n​Shortly before the fall term begins, all new EDI students gather on campus for a two-week-long orientation called Camp EDI. Camp EDI is an immersive program that includes intensive training and relationship building. Students leave the camp knowing how to use the tools needed to succeed in EDI, with new friendships formed, and excited for the work that lies ahead!Learn more about Camp EDI\nSee all news\nFrom EDI to the prestigious Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, Euiyoung Kim (EDI ‘11) applies a human-centered approach to mobility.\nLearn more about the culminating projects EDI students came up with and the problems they tried to solve.\nAudey Shen (EDI '25) shares how her internship focused on sustainability at HP reinforced key lessons she learned in Northwestern's Master of Science in Engineering Design Innovation (EDI) program.\nHoused within the\nWe educate the creative explorers of the future, focusing on the interconnectedness of technology, humans, and the natural world.

We look for a demonstrated interest in design and the human-centered design process. Be sure to highlight such interest in your portfolio examples, work experience, design innovation prompt and academic statement.\nWe admit applicants with a variety of academic degrees across disciplines in STEM, humanities, and the arts.  One of the strengths of our cohort model is the diversity of expertise our students have across various fields.\nThe EDI program considers BS/MS applications from students requiring 4 or fewer courses toward BS degree requirements entering the Fall of their final undergraduate year. Applications should be submitted by January 15 and will be considered on the same cycle as all other applications to the cohort. While you must have at least a 3.00 GPA to be considered, there are no automatic admits to the EDI program. Please submit your application through CollegeNet. Include your BS/MS plan of study, two recommenders, and the rest of the application requirements. If requested prior to submission of your application, a fee waiver code can be provided to BS/MS applicants.\nNo. Students may matriculate only in the fall term.\nNo. We do not have a policy of automatic admission for any student.\nNo. All applications completed and submitted by January 15 will be provided with an admissions decision on or about March 15.\nTypically the EDI cohort is filled from the applications received by January 15. If necessary, additional applications may be considered on a rolling basis.\nWe generally follow The Graduate School's guidelines on minimum GPA and test scores:\nSo long as the material you submit effectively conveys your interests, past experiences, and your approach to problem framing/solving you are on the right track. Take care in communicating the purpose for each project sample submitted.\nGenerally, applicants submit two to six projects, depending on each project’s scale and the amount of descriptive information required.  Projects may be academic, professional, or personal interest based.\nIf you received an undergraduate or graduate degree from an accredited institution where the language of instruction is English, you do not need to take the TOEFL or IELTS.\nIf you have taken the TOEFL/IELTS within the last two years, you may request to have those scores sent from ETS.\nUnder no other circumstances can the requirement be waived if your native language is not English.\nCamp EDI normally begins in early September, approximately two to three weeks before regular classes begin.\nCamp EDI is a two-three week, pre-term orientation workshop designed to familiarize new students with the people, resources, tools, and activities that will define the EDI experience while helping students build relationships with EDI faculty, staff, alumni, and peers.\nThe workshop consists of a set of intensive training sessions that provide students the opportunity to strengthen their skills in selected tools of the design trade, including 2D visualization and communication, 3D modeling, Solidworks, mechatronics, and equipment in the prototyping and fabrication shop.\nStudents work on a project that allows them to practice their newly acquired skills. Sessions are primarily devoted to instruction, and students are expected to work on their own time to complete the project.\nNew student registration opens in September. During Camp EDI, second-year EDI students will be able to field questions about elective courses and the registration process.\nUse these resources to help during the registration process:CAESAR: Student Information Portal LoginCAESAR FAQsEDI Curriculum BreakdownSegal Course Catalogue\nPlease refer to The Graduate School website for detailed information about the cost of tuition.\nStudents take it upon themselves to get involved in a variety of extracurricular activities. Examples include outreach-based activities such as mentoring student teams or volunteering with local elementary schools; cohort-based activities like the EDI volleyball team; and activities just for fun such as pottery classes.\nLearn more about student groups offered through the Segal Design Institute.\nVisit the Northwestern Student Affairs website.\nOur EDI classes tend to be split down the middle — about half of our students live in Evanston and another half live in Chicago. Students who live in Chicago usually live near the Purple Line CTA train, which operates express trains to Evanston. Students also live near the Red and Brown Line trains, which easily connect to the Purple Line.  All EDI classes are held on Northwestern's Evanston campus.\nLearn more about housing at:Northwestern’s Off-Campus How To GuideChicago Neighborhoods GuideChicago Transit Authority (CTA) Maps\nNorthwestern University's Off-Campus Life (OCL) serves as the first point of contact for all students moving and living off-campus.
