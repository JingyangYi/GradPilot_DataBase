Moreover, governments must make difficult decisions regarding how to distribute increasingly limited resources while balancing the interests of a wide range of stakeholders.Thus, the MIT Certificate Program in Science, Technology and Policy (STP) seeks to complement the outstanding academic experience MIT currently provides to its science and engineering PhD students with a rigorous introduction to the social and policy contexts in which their research is embedded. The required curriculum provides a coherent, rigorous introduction to the STP arena that can be reasonably integrated with the traditional PhD workload.Requirements \nCommon core\n\nOne full core course to introduce STP and the fundamental tools and methods for policy analysis.\n\n17.310 / IDS.412: Science, Technology & Public Policy (Spring)\n\n\nSPI Science Policy Bootcamp to introduce policymaking in action as applied to real-world issues in science and technology. Bootcamp is a one-week, 3-credit IAP course taught by former MIT Washington Office Director Bill Bonvillian and organized by the MIT Science Policy Initiative (SPI).\n\nElective requirements\n\nOne full approved elective course to deepen the core skill set and/or to apply it to a specific policy area.

Research assistantships are the most common means of support among TPP students, though some students receive support through fellowships (e.g. from US or international government funding agencies).\nTPP does not expect students to take out loans or use family resources or personal savings to support graduate studies.\nA certain amount of flexibility is highly desirable in terms of topic of specific research interest to help secure funding.\nApplication fee waiver: Waivers of the $90 application fee can be requested from MIT’s Office of Graduate Education (OGE) for applicants who are US citizens, US permanent residents, or international applicants attending US colleges and universities. Additional criteria for the waiver are outlined on OGE’s website.\nTalk to current students: Prospective students can fill out this form to ask current students about their experiences in the TPP program.

      "content": "[HEADING] Academics\n[HEADING] Apply\n[HEADING] What does the TPP Admissions team look for in an application?\n[HEADING] Academic Excellence\n[HEADING] Interest in Technology Policy\n[HEADING] Capacity for Technology Policy Leadership\n[HEADING] Collaboration, Culture, and Community\nThe MIT Technology and Policy Program strives to recruit a cohort of students  from a broad range of backgrounds and perspectives that exhibits academic excellence and a commitment to studying the societal impacts of technology through the integration of rigorous technical expertise and evidence-based policy analysis.\nThe program prepares graduates for professional careers at the interface of science, technology, and policy, including in industry, government, academia, regulatory agencies or consulting. Graduates also leave the program prepared for PhD work, such as the IDSS PhD in Social and Engineering Systems.\nApplicants to the Technology and Policy Program are expected to have the background to excel in graduate-level subjects in engineering, data analysis, statistics, economics, political science, and management, as well as to complete a research thesis that contributes to the field of technology policy. In addition to an appropriate academic background most successful candidates also have acquired one or more years of work experience following completion of their undergraduate degree. Again, these elements are not required for admission, but are common skills and experiences for most admitted students.\nWe evaluate each applicant individually, consider the opportunities that each prospective student has had to demonstrate their intellectual capabilities. In this context, we consider university coursework, research experience, and standardized test scores such as the Graduate Record Examination (GRE). (NOTE: For the 2025 Admissions Cycle, the GRE General Test is optional.) We pay particular attention to recent evidence of academic performance and achievements in areas directly relevant to technology and policy.\nWe evaluate prospective students’ interest in technology and policy through their prior experience and their statement of objectives. Practical experience in understanding how technology issues are approached in real-world contexts is important to students’ success in the program. Generally, successful applicants have previous work or internship experience in government, nonprofit, or industry sectors. We are particularly interested in hearing about the goals and career plans of applicants through their statement of objectives, and how TPP will fulfill their objectives.\nWe seek students who are prepared to work for the good of a larger community. Leadership experience is interpreted broadly – we would like to hear through your statement of objectives how you have influenced and inspired the people around you. We are especially interested in candidates who can be effective in motivating concern about issues, catalyzing coalitions to effect change, and managing implementation of new policies.\nTPP is committed to providing our students “with an education that combines rigorous academic study and the excitement of discovery with the support and intellectual stimulation of a diverse campus community” (MIT Mission). TPP students originate from all over the nation and the world and bring with them a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, interests, and experiences, which is critical to the educational objectives of TPP. TPP promotes team-centered learning to leverage these differences in fostering learning, critical thinking, intellectual growth, creativity, and innovation.\nOur students’ success improves with their exposure to many viewpoints and their ability to trust peers to provide both support and critique. Moreover, the experience of studying and working in a broad, heterogeneous cohort at MIT prepares our students to work effectively in the world outside MIT: it opens their minds and attunes them both to the variety of strengths and the variety of concerns of others.\nWe aim for all students to feel connected, engaged, and to come into contact with peers of differing backgrounds and to experience them as colleagues with valuable ideas and insights.\nIt is through this experience of the richness and heterogeneity of interests, strengths, viewpoints and concerns of their fellow students that our students become open-minded intellectuals and innovators, primed to pursue the MIT mission of the betterment of humankind.\nMIT Technology and Policy Program \nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n      77 Massachusetts Avenue\n      Cambridge, MA 02139-4307\n      617-253-7693\nAccessibility\n• About\n\nAbout TPP\n\nPeople\n\nFaculty Advisory Network\n\nResources\n\nJobs\n• About TPP\n• People\n• Faculty Advisory Network\n• Resources\n• Jobs\n• Academics\n\nAcademics\n\nCurriculum\n\nResearch Assistantships and Financial Support\n\nApply\n\nSTP Certificate Program\n• Academics\n• Curriculum\n• Research Assistantships and Financial Support\n• Apply\n• STP Certificate Program\n• Research\n\nResearch\n\nTheses\n\nResearch to Policy Engagement Initiative\n• Research\n• Theses\n• Research to Policy Engagement Initiative\n• News & Events\n\nNews\n\nEvents\n• News\n• Events\n• Contact\n• Subscribe\n• Support Us\n• About TPP\n• People\n• Faculty Advisory Network\n• Resources\n• Jobs\n• Academics\n• Curriculum\n• Research Assistantships and Financial Support\n• Apply\n• STP Certificate Program\n• Research\n• Theses\n• Research to Policy Engagement Initiative\n• News\n• Events\n• About▼About TPPPeopleFaculty Advisory NetworkResourcesJobs\n• About TPP\n• People\n• Faculty Advisory Network\n• Resources\n• Jobs\n• Academics▲AcademicsCurriculumResearch Assistantships and Financial SupportApply▼Application ProcessAdmissions FAQSTP Certificate Program▼Sample Elective Subjects for STPSTP Certificate Sample Capstone Project Publication Options\n• Academics\n• Curriculum\n• Research Assistantships and Financial Support\n• Apply▼Application ProcessAdmissions FAQ\n• Application Process\n• Admissions FAQ\n• STP Certificate Program▼Sample Elective Subjects for STPSTP Certificate Sample Capstone Project Publication Options\n• Sample Elective Subjects for STP\n• STP Certificate Sample Capstone Project Publication Options\n• Research▼ResearchTheses▼2016201720182019202020212022202320242025Research to Policy Engagement Initiative\n• Research\n• Theses▼2016201720182019202020212022202320242025\n• 2016\n• 2017\n• 2018\n• 2019\n• 2020\n• 2021\n• 2022\n• 2023\n• 2024\n• 2025\n• Research to Policy Engagement Initiative\n• News & Events▼NewsEvents\n• News\n• Events\n• Contact\n• Subscribe\n• Support Us\n• Academics\n• Curriculum\n• Research Assistantships and Financial Support\n• Apply▼Application ProcessAdmissions FAQ\n• Application Process\n• Admissions FAQ\n• STP Certificate Program▼Sample Elective Subjects for STPSTP Certificate Sample Capstone Project Publication Options\n• Sample Elective Subjects for STP\n• STP Certificate Sample Capstone Project Publication Options\n• Application Process\n• Admissions FAQ\n• Sample Elective Subjects for STP\n• STP Certificate Sample Capstone Project Publication Options\n• Research\n• Theses▼2016201720182019202020212022202320242025\n• 2016\n• 2017\n• 2018\n• 2019\n• 2020\n• 2021\n• 2022\n• 2023\n• 2024\n• 2025\n• Research to Policy Engagement Initiative\n• 2016\n• 2017\n• 2018\n• 2019\n• 2020\n• 2021\n• 2022\n• 2023\n• 2024\n• 2025\n• News\n• Events",

The TPP curriculum was designed for completion over the course of two years. Thesis research and writing must count for at least 24 units of the student’s final-year course load. This requirement makes graduating in less than two years very difficult, unless a student has already started thesis research through an MIT program that might be applicable to TPP.\nThe following sections give brief descriptions of the distinctive elements of the TPP curriculum. Additional details can be found through the MIT Course Bulletin.\nThe TPP thesis is a major professional work that builds upon the student’s technical concentration. It integrates the technology and policy of an issue, placing the technical problem in context and providing leadership regarding what can and ought to be done.\nThe majority of thesis work typically spans the two semesters of a student’s final year. The student prepares a thesis proposal in the first semester, submitting it for review by the TPP Thesis Committee no later than the start of the student’s final semester at MIT, during which the student does intensive work on their thesis.\nThe core restricted elective provides an opportunity both to deepen policy knowledge and to gain exposure to perspectives outside one’s own research area. Students will select a course from a list of pre-approved subjects that emphasizes the study and analysis of policy outside of a student’s main research domain.\nEach student is required to take a coherent sequence of three graduate-level subjects in technology and policy/social sciences. Student concentration areas can range from typical engineering disciplines such as Telecom Networks, Transportation and the Environment, and Materials Engineering to more creative and unique concentration areas such as Electric Energy in Developing Nations, Biotechnology, and Technology Education.\nThe technical concentration is highly flexible and allows students to choose relevant courses that align with their interests and research. Furthermore, TPP students are able to cross-register and take courses at Harvard’s graduate schools. A student’s technical concentration requires approval from both the student’s research supervisor and the TPP administration.\nTPP holds a weekly research seminar that is open to the TPP community. Every student is required to make at least one seminar presentation while enrolled in TPP with scheduling preference given to continuing students or any student expecting to graduate during the current academic year.\nDuring the academic year, TPP will offer short class modules in leadership and communication, which all students must have completed before graduation. The timing of these modules will be announced during the Fall term. TPP strongly recommends that all students set aside the last week of the January intersession, Independent Activities Period (IAP), when TPP typically arranges for these modules to be held.\nComplete degree requirement information can be found through the MIT Course Bulletin.\nMIT Technology and Policy Program \nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n      77 Massachusetts Avenue\n      Cambridge, MA 02139-4307\n      617-253-7693\nAccessibility\n• About\n\nAbout TPP\n\nPeople\n\nFaculty Advisory Network\n\nResources\n\nJobs\n• About TPP\n• People\n• Faculty Advisory Network\n• Resources\n• Jobs\n• Academics\n\nAcademics\n\nCurriculum\n\nResearch Assistantships and Financial Support\n\nApply\n\nSTP Certificate Program\n• Academics\n• Curriculum\n• Research Assistantships and Financial Support\n• Apply\n• STP Certificate Program\n• Research\n\nResearch\n\nTheses\n\nResearch to Policy Engagement Initiative\n• Research\n• Theses\n• Research to Policy Engagement Initiative\n• News & Events\n\nNews\n\nEvents\n• News\n• Events\n• Contact\n• Subscribe\n• Support Us\n• About TPP\n• People\n• Faculty Advisory Network\n• Resources\n• Jobs\n• Academics\n• Curriculum\n• Research Assistantships and Financial Support\n• Apply\n• STP Certificate Program\n• Research\n• Theses\n• Research to Policy Engagement Initiative\n• News\n• Events\n• Concepts and Research in Technology & Policy(IDS.411)\n• Quantitative Methods\n• Thesis Research (IDS.THG)\n• Science, Technology and Public Policy (IDS.412)\n• Microeconomics\n• Restricted Elective\n• 30+ units of graduate subjects\n• Coherent area of study\n• Aligned with research area\n• TPP Research Seminar\n• Training Modules\n\nCommunication\nLeadership\n• Communication\n• Leadership\n• Optional Internship\n• Communication\n• Leadership\n• About▼About TPPPeopleFaculty Advisory NetworkResourcesJobs\n• About TPP\n• People\n• Faculty Advisory Network\n• Resources\n• Jobs\n• Academics▲AcademicsCurriculumResearch Assistantships and Financial SupportApply▼Application ProcessAdmissions FAQSTP Certificate Program▼Sample Elective Subjects for STPSTP Certificate Sample Capstone Project Publication Options\n• Academics\n• Curriculum\n• Research Assistantships and Financial Support\n• Apply▼Application ProcessAdmissions FAQ\n• Application Process\n• Admissions FAQ\n• STP Certificate Program▼Sample Elective Subjects for STPSTP Certificate Sample Capstone Project Publication Options\n• Sample Elective Subjects for STP\n• STP Certificate Sample Capstone Project Publication Options\n• Research▼ResearchTheses▼2016201720182019202020212022202320242025Research to Policy Engagement Initiative\n• Research\n• Theses▼2016201720182019202020212022202320242025\n• 2016\n• 2017\n• 2018\n• 2019\n• 2020\n• 2021\n• 2022\n• 2023\n• 2024\n• 2025\n• Research to Policy Engagement Initiative\n• News & Events▼NewsEvents\n• News\n• Events\n• Contact\n• Subscribe\n• Support Us\n• Academics\n• Curriculum\n• Research Assistantships and Financial Support\n• Apply▼Application ProcessAdmissions FAQ\n• Application Process\n• Admissions FAQ\n• STP Certificate Program▼Sample Elective Subjects for STPSTP Certificate Sample Capstone Project Publication Options\n• Sample Elective Subjects for STP\n• STP Certificate Sample Capstone Project Publication Options\n• Application Process\n• Admissions FAQ\n• Sample Elective Subjects for STP\n• STP Certificate Sample Capstone Project Publication Options\n• Research\n• Theses▼2016201720182019202020212022202320242025\n• 2016\n• 2017\n• 2018\n• 2019\n• 2020\n• 2021\n• 2022\n• 2023\n• 2024\n• 2025\n• Research to Policy Engagement Initiative\n• 2016\n• 2017\n• 2018\n• 2019\n• 2020\n• 2021\n• 2022\n• 2023\n• 2024\n• 2025\n• News\n• Events\n[HTML_TABLE]\nCore integrative |  | Methods and Frameworks |  | Technical Concentration |  | Development\nConcepts and Research in Technology & Policy(IDS.411)\nQuantitative Methods\nThesis Research (IDS.THG) |  | Science, Technology and Public Policy (IDS.412)\nMicroeconomics\nRestricted Elective |  | 30+ units of graduate subjects\nCoherent area of study\nAligned with research area |  | TPP Research Seminar\nTraining Modules\n\nCommunication\nLeadership\n\n\nOptional Internship",
