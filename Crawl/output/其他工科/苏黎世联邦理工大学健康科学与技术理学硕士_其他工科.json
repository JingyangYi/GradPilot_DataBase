In the combination of natural sciences and engineering knowledge, medical science issues are analysed on the cellular and molecular level up to the human organism as a whole. This creates new opportunities in prevention, diagnostics and therapy. In this context, the translational aspect, i.e. the fast and efficient implementation of preclinical research into clinical development, is given high priority.\nStudents of this course are familiarised with the ethical requirements for human studies and with the interpretation and critical discussion of results. Most important task of the Master's degree programme is the introduction to (experimental) scientific work.\nThe students deepen their theoretical knowledge in the chosen subject area, put their knowledge to practical use in two internships of 12 weeks each and demonstrate their ability to work independently, in a structured and scientific manner with the 6-month Master’s thesis. This should enable them to manage and carry out projects at the university, in industry and in the service sector in the area of research and advice. It offers an innovative medical science training between people, health and technology.\n90 ECTS | 1.5 years\nMaster of Science ETH in Health Sciences and Technology\nDownload MSc Health Sciences and Technology (PDF, 169 KB)\nMaster’s degree programme in Health Sciences and Technology\nETH Zurich\n                    Department of Health Sciences and Technology\n                    Leopold-Ruzicka-Weg 4\n                HCP H 25.3\n                8093 \n                Zurich\n            Switzerland\n• Homepage\n• Navigation\n• Search\n• Content\n• Footer\n• Contact\n• Sitemap\n• Human Movement Science and Sport\n• Medical Technology\n• Molecular Health Sciences\n• Neurosciences\n• Human Health, Nutrition, and Environment\n• Rehabilitation and Inclusion\n• Phone\n                        +41 44 632 58 76\n[CARD]\nContact\nDr. Roland Müller\n\n\n\nPhone\n                        +41 44 632 58 76\n\n\n\n\n\n            ETH Zurich\n                    Department of Health Sciences and Technology\n                    Leopold-Ruzicka-Weg 4\n                HCP H 25.3\n                8093 \n                Zurich\n            Switzerland\n\n\n\n\n\n              Show more\n\n              Show less\n[CARD]\nContact\n[CARD]\nDr. Roland Müller\n\n\n\nPhone\n                        +41 44 632 58 76\n\n\n\n\n\n            ETH Zurich\n                    Department of Health Sciences and Technology\n                    Leopold-Ruzicka-Weg 4\n                HCP H 25.3\n                8093 \n                Zurich\n            Switzerland\n\n\n\n\n\n              Show more\n\n              Show less\n[CARD]\nDr. Roland Müller\n[CARD]\nPhone\n                        +41 44 632 58 76\n[CARD]\nETH Zurich\n                    Department of Health Sciences and Technology\n                    Leopold-Ruzicka-Weg 4\n                HCP H 25.3\n                8093 \n                Zurich\n            Switzerland\n[CARD]\nShow more\n\n              Show less",
