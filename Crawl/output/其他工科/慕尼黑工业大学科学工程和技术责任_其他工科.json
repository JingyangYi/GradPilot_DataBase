In an environment of increasing economic and political uncertainty, RESET takes serious challenges such as:\nFor a comprehensive description of the program, please refer to the degree program documentation:\nThe program draws its interdisciplinary strength and symmetry from a diverse student body – with backgrounds in the natural sciences and engineering as well as the social sciences and humanities – and specifically targets students with previous work or research experience. An innovative term structure and hands-on immersive learning based on case studies, projects and an internship foster new forms of collaboration across institutions and disciplines.\nRESET conveys the knowledge, methods and analytical tools necessary for understanding and responding to the unique challenges resulting from the increasing interconnectedness of science, technology, society, politics and economics. With its distinctive focus on issues of responsibility and responsiveness, the program combines rigorous training in science and technology studies (STS) with project-based immersion in engineering, science, citizen engagement and policy-making. In particular, graduates are able to identify, analyze and critically discuss social, economic, political, cultural and legal aspects of science and technology.\nStudents benefit from small course sizes, individual support from RESET’s teaching staff and a range of services offered by the Elite Network of Bavaria, which the program is affiliated to. They are able to acquire expert knowledge at the cutting edge of international technoscience research as well as extensive communication and project management skills. The language of instruction is English and international student groups and projects help prepare students for a global working environment.\nRESET graduates will be able to work in a range of fields, including government, international organizations, innovative firms (both established companies and start-ups), NGOs, think tanks, research and higher education management, consulting, or pursue a career in academia.\nThe first semester is dedicated to introducing students to the social, economic, political, media and legal aspects of innovation, controversies and responsibility in science and technology. This is facilitated by an innovative term structure, immersive projects, and by hands-on training in STS research methods.\nThe second semester provides in-depth introductions to STEM fields, complemented by three elective specialization lectures and seminars in key STS fields.\nThe third semester primarily serves to gain practical experience through an internship and a research project. Students also publish a blog and organize an interdisciplinary science workshop.\nThe fourth semester is reserved for the Master’s thesis, through which students learn how to carry out research that is highly relevant to stakeholders in academia, industry, government and NGOs.\nRequired language skills for admission:\nYou need sufficient English language skills if you wish to apply for this program. Evidence of your language proficiency has to be submitted before the end of the application deadline. Learn more about recognized certificates and other ways to prove your English language skills.\nThis evidence of your language proficiency confirms that you comply with the minimum language requirements for admission to the program.

What are the deadlines?\n[HEADING] Special case: Application from the first to the second subject semester (Fachsemester)\n[HEADING] Application for Credit Transfer Report\n[HEADING] Credit Transfer Report\nIf you have already completed relevant courses at a different university or in another course of study, you can apply to a higher subject semester (Fachsemester). To do this, you need a credit transfer report.\nIn any case, be sure to contact your departmental student academic advisor before applying to a higher subject semester (Fachsemester). You can find the respective contact person in the search field at the bottom of this page.\nThe recognition process depends on your previous course of study:\nIf you apply for a degree program at TUM and have already completed courses in an identical or related program, your previous study periods will be officially recognized and you will be automatically assigned to the corresponding semester at TUM. After enrolling, you must apply for the recognition of your previously earned credits at your department.\nIf you apply for a degree program at TUM and have already completed courses in another, non-related program, you can make an application to have these courses recognized. If courses or previously earned credits are recognized to a certain amount, you will be placed in a higher subject semester (Fachsemester) of the degree program at TUM.\nThe recognition of credits is defined by the Bavarian University Law and the General Academic and Examination Regulations of TUM.\nPeriods of study from identical or related degree programs will be officially recognized. This means that at TUM you will be enrolled in the semester corresponding your previous study times. After your enrollment at TUM, you additionally have to apply for the recognition of your previously earned credits at your school.\nCredits from other, non-related degree programs can only be recognized if there is no essential difference between the acquired learning outcomes and those required in your TUM degree program. This can only be assessed after an in-depth review at the school upon application.\nStudy periods from identical or related degree programs will be recognized automatically. At TUM you will be enrolled in the semester corresponding to your previous study times. After your enrollment, you additionally have to apply for the recognition of your previously earned credits at your school. Please make sure to contact your departmental academic student advisor early on! You can search for the corresponding contact in the right margin column under “Departmental Student Advising”.\nIf you apply for a degree program at TUM and have already completed courses in another, non-related program, there are two different application processes to a higher subject semester (Fachsemester): the upstream and the downstream process. Please check the list below for the relevant process concerning your application.\nThe upstream process starts with a mandatory advising session at the school before the online application. There, you will discuss your previously earned credits with a representative of the school. You fill in the application form to a higher subject semester (Fachsemester) during the advising session. With the signature of the school, the application form turns into a credit transfer report.

The program draws its interdisciplinary strength and symmetry from a diverse student body – with backgrounds in science, technology and engineering as well as social and life sciences, psychology and the humanities – and is aimed at students with previous work or research experience.\nRESET students acquire broad and in-depth knowledge of theories, methods and techniques from various disciplines including STS, public policy, innovation studies, economics, law, media studies and ethics. Furthermore, they learn to reflect on STEM fields from a responsibility perspective.\nIn recent years, the fast pace of societal, political, economic, environmental, and technological transformations has been creating new and urgent challenges. RESET responds to these challenges by training students for public and private sector careers in ways that inflect advances in science and technology with questions of governance, responsibility, responsiveness, precaution, and care in innovation processes from agenda-setting to usage. This highly innovative M.A. program thus fulfills a growing and urgent demand for jobs at the intersection of science, innovation, and society, which we did not know existed a couple of years ago.\nRESET graduates are qualified internationally for a wide range of career fields within governmental institutions, international organizations, innovative firms (both established companies and start-ups), NGOs, think tanks, consulting and academia. They are able to critically reflect upon and contribute to responsible research and innovation in emerging sociotechnical fields such as sustainable energy solutions, industrial biotechnology, biomedical health care, the Internet of Things, big data and urban infrastructure. Furthermore, the degree qualifies graduates to pursue advanced research on a doctoral level.\nThe program’s mandatory internship provides valuable insights into future career options. The following examples give a brief insight into possible tasks and fields of practice:\nOrganizations: Max Planck Society, Fraunhofer Society, Siemens AG, Allianz SE, Acatech, IT University of Copenhagen, Germany’s Federal Foreign Office, UNESCO World Heritage Center, Bayrischer Rundfunk, Biotech and IT Start-ups, local NGO initiatives\nDepartments: science communication, HR, innovation and project management\n• Responsibility and responsiveness: A distinctive focus on the socio-technological dynamics and effects of innovation and research. In particular, graduates are able to identify and critically discuss social, economic, political, cultural and legal aspects of science and technology.\n• An immersive and practice-oriented education: An innovative term structure and hands-on immersive learning based on case studies, projects and an internship foster new forms of collaboration across institutions and disciplines.\n• Intensive academic support: Students benefit from small course sizes, in-depth discussions and individual support from RESET’s teaching staff. Furthermore, they get support from the Elite Network of Bavaria.\n• International competitiveness: The language of instruction is English and international student groups and projects help prepare students for a global working environment. Students are able to acquire expert knowledge at the cutting edge of international technoscience research as well as extensive communication and project management skills. In addition, they have the option of doing their internship or a semester abroad.\n• assisting with the responsible introduction of artificial intelligence and digital technologies\n• developing new sustainable products and services\n• conducting own research\n• international program management\n• communicating new scientific achievements to the public",

      "content": "[HEADING] Master's Degree Programs at TUM\nTUM offers over 100 master’s degree programs from a variety of fields. Find out here what master’s programs there are and how to apply.\nMaster’s degree programs are graduate studies. That means, you have to complete an undergraduate degree to qualify, for example a bachelor’s degree program.\nDepending on the program, TUM awards the following master’s degrees: Master of Science (M.Sc.), Master of Arts (M.A.), Master of Business Administration (MBA), Master of Education (M.Ed.) and Master of Science with honors (M.Sc. with honors). As a rule, students with master's degrees are entitled to pursue a doctorate.\nIf you have completed your studies outside of Germany and would now like to know what options you have with your degree with respect to master's degree programs in germany, the anabin-database can provide orientation.\nA master's program can build on an undergraduate degree or it can be used to pursue a new field of study. In either case, these are referred to as consecutive master’s programs. Other master’s programs are particularly aimed at prospective students with professional experience. These are referred to as continuing education master’s programs. Contact the Student Advisory Office to learn how the TUM bachelor's programs align with the TUM master's programs or visit Master’s Day, which takes place annually.\nView Master's Degree Programs at TUM\nConsecutive master’s programs are often structured on a bachelor's program of the same name. They are designed to deepen and expand the knowledge acquired during the undergraduate program. TUM offers at least one consecutive master's program for each bachelor's program.\nSome master's programs are not structured on the basis of specific bachelor's programs. Instead, they can be pursued by students who hold bachelor's degrees from a range of different fields. While these programs require certain fundamental knowledge, this can be acquired through various bachelor's programs.  Example: TUM graduates with a Bachelor's in mechanical engineering can apply for a Master's in aerospace, mechanical engineering or robotics, cognition, intelligence, to name a few.\nAs a rule, continuing education master’s programs require candidates to have at least one year of work experience. In some cases, the programs may be attended while holding gainful employment. Duration of studies varies accordingly. Special tuition fees also apply.  Example: Students with a Bachelor's or undergraduate degree in electrical engineering and information technology have the option of pursuing continuing education master's programs like an Executive MBA.\nTUM also offers double degree programs. Double degree programs give you the opportunity to receive a degree from both TUM and one of its partner universities.\nHere you will find further information on double degree programs.\nMaster degree programs are subject to a two-step aptitude assessment procedure. Once an application has been received, the first step involves evaluating the application documents based on a point system. Depending on the number of points accumulated, candidates are then immediately accepted, rejected or invited to a selection interview. Some programs also use a written test instead of the selection interview. Consult the Academic and Examination Regulations  of the desired program for further information regarding the required documentation and criteria.\nLecture period, lecture-free days, or enrollment periods – all semester dates and deadlines at a glance.\nFind answers to the most frequently asked questions.\nEverything you need to know about documents required for application\n+49 89 289 22245  Monday to Friday, 9:00 a.m. – 12:00 p.m.   studiumspam prevention@tum.de Please observe the e-mail etiquette.\nFind all the info on our services here.\nPersonal advising sessions with General Student Advising by appointment.\nCampus Munich, Arcisstraße 21, Room 0144, 80333 München\nMonday, Wednesday, Friday: 9 a.m. – 12 p.m.\nTuesday and Thursday, 1 p.m. – 4 p.m. (Student Information only)\n• Show convenient version of this site\n• Don't show this message again\n[CARD]\nDates and Deadlines\nDates and Deadlines\n\n\nLecture period, lecture-free days, or enrollment periods – all semester dates and deadlines at a glance.\n[CARD]\nDates and Deadlines\nDates and Deadlines\n[CARD]\nDates and Deadlines\n[CARD]\nLecture period, lecture-free days, or enrollment periods – all semester dates and deadlines at a glance.\n[CARD]\nFAQs about your studies at TUM\nFAQs about your studies at TUM\n\n\nFind answers to the most frequently asked questions.\n[CARD]\nFAQs about your studies at TUM\nFAQs about your studies at TUM\n[CARD]\nFAQs about your studies at TUM\n[CARD]\nFind answers to the most frequently asked questions.\n[CARD]\nGlossary of Documents\nGlossary of Documents\n\n\nEverything you need to know about documents required for application\n[CARD]\nGlossary of Documents\nGlossary of Documents\n[CARD]\nGlossary of Documents\n[CARD]\nEverything you need to know about documents required for application\n[CARD]\nStudent Advising and Information Services\nStudent Advising and Information Services\n\n\n +49 89 289 22245  Monday to Friday, 9:00 a.m. – 12:00 p.m.   studiumspam prevention@tum.de Please observe the e-mail etiquette.\nFind all the info on our services here.\nPersonal advising sessions with General Student Advising by appointment.\n[CARD]\nStudent Advising and Information Services\nStudent Advising and Information Services\n[CARD]\nStudent Advising and Information Services\n[CARD]\n+49 89 289 22245  Monday to Friday, 9:00 a.m. – 12:00 p.m.   studiumspam prevention@tum.de Please observe the e-mail etiquette.\nFind all the info on our services here.\nPersonal advising sessions with General Student Advising by appointment.\n[CARD]\nService Desk\nService Desk\n\n\n Campus Munich, Arcisstraße 21, Room 0144, 80333 München\nMonday, Wednesday, Friday: 9 a.m. – 12 p.m.\nTuesday and Thursday, 1 p.m. – 4 p.m. (Student Information only)\n[CARD]\nService Desk\nService Desk\n[CARD]\nService Desk\n[CARD]\nCampus Munich, Arcisstraße 21, Room 0144, 80333 München\nMonday, Wednesday, Friday: 9 a.m. – 12 p.m.\nTuesday and Thursday, 1 p.m. – 4 p.m. (Student Information only)",

Vocational Education and Innovation\nAt the Technical University of Munich (TUM), tuition fees are charged for international students from third countries who newly enroll in a degree program starting in the winter semester of 2024/25.\nOn this page, you can find out who these tuition fees apply to and how TUM uses them to improve studying and teaching for all students.\nFrom the winter semester 2024/25, tuition fees for international students from third countries will only be charged for newly enrolled students in Bachelor's and Master's degree programs.\nAs a leading international university, the Technical University of Munich is committed to offering our talented students the best possible conditions to develop their skills and personalities. Every year, more and more young people from all over the world place their trust in the opportunities that TUM offers them for their future. We want to continue to live up to this trust and give our students access to outstanding education and training.\nTo achieve this, it is essential to offer not only outstanding personalities in research and teaching, but also the highest standards of infrastructure, equipment, study areas, management, and support for our students.

      "content": "Admission to degree programs at TUM is handled in several different ways. This page provides an overview of the admission procedures.\nBe sure to inform yourself about the details of the procedure for a specific program in the academic and examination regulations or the regulations on the aptitude assessment or aptitude recommendation.\nApplicants will be granted admission to a program with unrestricted admission when\nCertain programs require that an internship be completed before the start of studies. When applying for a Master's program, the applicant's Bachelor's degree will be checked to confirm that it is accredited. This is especially true if the applicant is transferring from another university.\nUnrestricted degree programs\nFirst, the applicant’s grade point average and subject-specific grades will be evaluated using a point system. Which grades are evaluated and how they are weighted depends on the applicant’s chosen degree program. Each program has a set of statutes that define the formula to be used. Depending on the degree program and the amount of points accumulated, applicants are either immediately admitted or invited to an admissions interview or written test carried out by the school. The interview or test helps determine if the applicant is capable of successfully completing the desired degree program. For certain programs, the interview or written test is also intended to determine whether the necessary language requirements are met. For some programs, applicants below a certain point threshold may be rejected without an interview or written test.\nPlease note: In contrast to the Numerus Clausus programs, the number of spots available (capacity limit) is not fixed. We accept all applicants we feel are qualified. As such, no lotteries will be held after final selections have been made, and there will be no list of alternatives for unsuccessful applicants to claim unwanted spots.\nDegree programs subject to aptitude assessment\nOur Aptitude recommendation supports students in choosing the degree program best suited to their interests and abilities.\nFirst, the applicant’s grade point average and subject-specific grades will be evaluated using a point system. Which grades are evaluated and how they are weighted depends on the applicant’s chosen degree program. Each program has a set of statues that defines the formula to be used. Depending on the amount of points accumulated, applicants are either immediately admitted or invited to a  mandatory, 20 minute interview carried out by the school. The interview helps determine if the applicant is capable of successfully completing the desired course of study. There is no written test.\nThe result of the interview determines whether the applicant receives a recommendation for the degree program. The purpose of the recommendation is to help students select the right program – it is, however, no mandatory requirement for admission.\nNC degree programs have a fixed number of spots available, awarded primarily based on the applicant's grade point average and the amount of time the student has been waiting for a spot. This amount of time is defined as the number of semesters that have elapsed since completion of secondary studies and in which the applicant has not been admitted to a German university. Periods in which the applicant audited classes or studied abroad also count as waiting time. Applicants who are not admitted are automatically put on an alternatives list. These students may be admitted at a later date in the event a spot is not accepted by another student.\nNC program eligibility will be based solely on the results of the past years. The grade point average of the last person to have been admitted constitutes the current NC standard. Since the number of applicants and their criteria (grades, waiting time, etc.) are unpredictable, it is still possible to apply with a lower grade point average than the current NC grades.\nDegree programs with restricted admission\nPlease note: The application and admission for NC programs is coordinated via the dialogue-oriented service procedure.\nIn the initial stage of this procedure, the grades you obtained during your Bachelor’s program, as well as your written documents, will be evaluated using a point system.\nFor some degree programs, the first stage of the aptitude assessment differs for applicants who have obtained their Bachelor’s degree in a country outside the scope of the “Lisbon Convention”: They have to take an online test. You can find out whether this applies to your desired degree program on the respective program page in the section “How do I apply?”.\nDepending on the number of points accumulated, applicants are either immediately admitted, rejected, or invited to a 20 minute admissions interview carried out by the school. In some cases interviews by telephone or video for international students are common. The interview helps determine if the applicant is capable of successfully completing the desired course of study. For some programs offered by the TUM School of Engineering and Design and the TUM School of Management a written test or the assessment of your academic qualification and your essay replace the interview.\nLecture period, lecture-free days, or enrollment periods – all semester dates and deadlines at a glance.\n+49 89 289 22245  Monday to Friday, 9:00 a.m. – 12:00 p.m.   studiumspam prevention@tum.de Please observe the e-mail etiquette.\nFind all the info on our services here.\nPersonal advising sessions with General Student Advising by appointment.\nCampus Munich, Arcisstraße 21, Room 0144, 80333 München\nMonday, Wednesday, Friday: 9 a.m. – 12 p.m.\nTuesday and Thursday, 1 p.m. – 4 p.m. (Student Information only)\n• Show convenient version of this site\n• Don't show this message again\n• Unrestricted degree programs\n• Aptitude assessment for Bachelor’s degree programs\n• Aptitude recommendation (SOV) for Bachelor’s degree applicants\n• Restricted degree programs (Numerus Clausus, NC)\n• Aptitude assessment for Master’s degree applicants\n• the online application was submitted in time and complete with all required documents,\n• and your documents have been reviewed.\n[CARD]\nDates and Deadlines\nDates and Deadlines\n\n\nLecture period, lecture-free days, or enrollment periods – all semester dates and deadlines at a glance.\n[CARD]\nDates and Deadlines\nDates and Deadlines\n[CARD]\nDates and Deadlines\n[CARD]\nLecture period, lecture-free days, or enrollment periods – all semester dates and deadlines at a glance.\n[CARD]\nStudent Advising and Information Services\nStudent Advising and Information Services\n\n\n +49 89 289 22245  Monday to Friday, 9:00 a.m. – 12:00 p.m.   studiumspam prevention@tum.de Please observe the e-mail etiquette.\nFind all the info on our services here.\nPersonal advising sessions with General Student Advising by appointment.\n[CARD]\nStudent Advising and Information Services\nStudent Advising and Information Services\n[CARD]\nStudent Advising and Information Services\n[CARD]\n+49 89 289 22245  Monday to Friday, 9:00 a.m. – 12:00 p.m.   studiumspam prevention@tum.de Please observe the e-mail etiquette.\nFind all the info on our services here.\nPersonal advising sessions with General Student Advising by appointment.\n[CARD]\nService Desk\nService Desk\n\n\n Campus Munich, Arcisstraße 21, Room 0144, 80333 München\nMonday, Wednesday, Friday: 9 a.m. – 12 p.m.\nTuesday and Thursday, 1 p.m. – 4 p.m. (Student Information only)\n[CARD]\nService Desk\nService Desk\n[CARD]\nService Desk\n[CARD]\nCampus Munich, Arcisstraße 21, Room 0144, 80333 München\nMonday, Wednesday, Friday: 9 a.m. – 12 p.m.\nTuesday and Thursday, 1 p.m. – 4 p.m. (Student Information only)",
