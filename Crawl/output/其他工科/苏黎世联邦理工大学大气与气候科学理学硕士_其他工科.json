During the Master's thesis, students work on their own research project for 6 months which is embedded in one of the research groups at the Institute for Atmospheric and Climate Science.\nThis Master is suitable for BSc students with a profound knowledge in Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry (e.g. BSc in Earth and Climate Sciences, BSc in Physics, BSc in Chemistry) or also to students with a BSc in Geography when they obtained additional knowledge in Mathematics/Physics/Chemistry.\n90 ECTS | 1.5 years\nMaster of Science ETH in Atmospheric and Climate Science\nDownload MSc Atmospheric and Climate Science (PDF, 227 KB)\nMaster’s degree programme in Atmospheric and Climate Science\nETH Zurich\n                    Department of Environmental Systems Science\n                    Universitaetstrasse 16\n                CHN M 18\n                8092 \n                Zurich\n            Switzerland\n• Homepage\n• Navigation\n• Search\n• Content\n• Footer\n• Contact\n• Sitemap\n• weather systems and atmospheric dynamics\n• climate processes and feedbacks\n• atmospheric composition and cycles\n• climate history and paleoclimatology\n• hydrology and water cycle\n• Phone\n                        +41 44 632 93 65\n[CARD]\nContact\nDr. Hanna Joos\n\n\n\nPhone\n                        +41 44 632 93 65\n\n\n\n\n\n            ETH Zurich\n                    Department of Environmental Systems Science\n                    Universitaetstrasse 16\n                CHN M 18\n                8092 \n                Zurich\n            Switzerland\n\n\n\n\n\n              Show more\n\n              Show less\n[CARD]\nContact\n[CARD]\nDr. Hanna Joos\n\n\n\nPhone\n                        +41 44 632 93 65\n\n\n\n\n\n            ETH Zurich\n                    Department of Environmental Systems Science\n                    Universitaetstrasse 16\n                CHN M 18\n                8092 \n                Zurich\n            Switzerland\n\n\n\n\n\n              Show more\n\n              Show less\n[CARD]\nDr. Hanna Joos\n[CARD]\nPhone\n                        +41 44 632 93 65\n[CARD]\nETH Zurich\n                    Department of Environmental Systems Science\n                    Universitaetstrasse 16\n                CHN M 18\n                8092 \n                Zurich\n            Switzerland\n[CARD]\nShow more\n\n              Show less",

The MSc in Atmospheric and Climate Science, hosted by the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences and the MSc in Environmental Science, Major Atmosphere and Climate, hosted by the Department of Environmental Systems Science. Both programmes are very similar, the students attend the same courses and follow a very similar curriculum. However, there are subtle differences between the two programmes.\nThe following information applies to the Master in Atmospheric and Climate Science and the Master in Environmental Sciences, Major Atmosphere and Climate.\nThis is an example structure of the Master programme. Note that students in the Environmental Sciences Master programme must complete an internship but are free to choose at what time during their studies they decide to do the internship.\nFor more
