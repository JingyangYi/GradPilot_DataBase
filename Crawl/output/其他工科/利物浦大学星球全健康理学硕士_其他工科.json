By the end of this module, students will be prepared to carry out their MSc research project.\nPlanetary Health IVES 727\nPlanetary Health is defined as “the health of human civilization and the natural systems on which it depends”. Consequently, this module will train you in broader skills such as taking a holistic and interrelated approach to health, studying how the health of humans, non-human animals, our climate, and ecology are all linked and affect each other. By recognising this interrelatedness, you will be able to answer more complex and long-term health questions such as: How do climate change and animal movements affect the distribution and interaction between humans, animals and their diseases? And how do land use change and biodiversity loss affect ecology and climate? In short, you will be trained to consider the bigger picture to answer specific health questions. The course concludes with a focus on response and mitigation – specifically, how policymakers need to consider the full range of interconnected facets, and work both locally and globally to address these global challenges. As part of this, you will gain skills in interpreting and evaluating government policy documents.\nOne Health IVES 715\nThis module will introduce students to interdisciplinary approaches to tackling disease from a collaborative One Health perspective. The module will train students in how One Health approaches can be used to address complex health challenges by considering human-animal-environment interactions. It will equip you with the skillset to develop and evaluate One Health research and policy. Key focus areas within the module include emerging infectious diseases involving animals (i.e. zoonoses) food security and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) as well as examining how the success of One Health disease control programmes can be monitored and evaluated. The principles and techniques will be taught using lectures, seminars with practical opportunities for skills development during the module workshops.Opportunities for active participation will build confidence in the cornerstones of One Health cross-sectoral working including collaboration, co-ordination, communication and capacity building.This course will foster One Health graduates equipped to make an impactful contribution to global citizenship.\nBiological Data skills LIFE707\nData skills are essential for a career in modern biology. Biological studies increasingly involve the generation of large or complex sets of data, and the ability to analyse data is a core component of a successful biologist’s skill set. Digital fluency is also required more widely outside biological research and a grounding in data analysis is in demand by a broad range of employers. Here you will learn the ability to visualise data, critically test hypotheses, and to interpret and present results.The module will also introduce students to the powerful open access statistical software package, R.For any students studying off-campus – due to a placement in industry or studying at an overseas University – on-line drop-in sessions will be provided instead of the practical workshops.\nSemester one compulsory modules:\nModules listed are subject to approval – the full module structure for this course will be available soon.\nProgramme details and modules listed are illustrative only and subject to change.\nSemester two compulsory modules:\n\nMapping for Planetary and One Health IVES728\nThis module offers students with a unique opportunity to explore the powerful intersection of geography, human and animal health, climate and environment, and technology. It will equip them with key knowledge, skills, and techniques for investigating and mapping complex spatial variations and interactions. This is critically important and timely, as climate change is projected to influence disease distributions and increase the frequency of outbreaks.Students will gain hands-on experience with geographical information systems (GIS), spatial analytical methods, and the creation of maps that can inform health policies and interventions and help to mitigate the impact of the global threats. No previous knowledge is required, as the module’s active-learning approach ensures that students will gain the practical experience working with real-world data, and become able to process and evaluate covered topics.\nGlobal Outbreak Surveillance and Control IVES717\nThis is a key module for students with an interest in developing knowledge, skills, and techniques for investigating and controlling global human and animal disease outbreaks. The module is topical and timely, in light of the recent pandemic and will provide students with an opportunity to deal with the different phases and complexities of outbreaks at global, national, and local levels, from the start to finish using a variety of relevant exemplars. The module comprises lectures, seminars, and workshops led by leading academics, and external key stakeholders with expertise in detection, control, surveillance, communication, governance, policy, bioinformatics, economic and community engagement applications, all integral to the investigation of, and control of outbreaks. The module uses active-learning delivery methods to ensure students can process and evaluate the topics, and has three assessments aimed at developing knowledge and skills in infographics, verbal communication and written reports.\nUnderstanding Models and Data IVES724\nIn recent years, data and statistics have become a feature of emerging public health situations to an extent that is historically unprecedented. Scientists, policy makers and the public have had to become confident consumers of numbers and model predictions. The actors involved in the management of infectious diseases are not necessarily modelling specialists themselves, but nevertheless need to interpret statistical and modelling results and be aware of their limitations.This module will train students to understand what can and cannot be learnt from data and modelling results. The module does not assume that students are experts in statistics or modelling. Students will receive training in how to use simple visualisations and analysis to gain a robust understanding of key patterns in data, and how to recognise common pitfalls in data interpretation. Students will learn the distinction between different approaches in statistics and quantitative modelling, and when it is appropriate to use them. Particular attention will be paid to the management of uncertainty in model predictions. The module will equip students to interpret critically the quantitative results in scientific papers and reports, and how to use them to inform the management of infectious diseases.\nSemester two compulsory modules:\nIVES Research Project IVES702\nThis module offers students the exciting opportunity to conduct an independent research project related to their chosen area of study under academic guidance.

Students will work in collaboration with their research project supervisor to devise a plan of work aimed at developing the knowledge and skills that will be required for the MSc research project. Students will create a research development needs report and will determine how to address gaps in practical skills while reflecting on how and where new skills have been obtained. Students will also write a literature review on a topic closely related to their planned research project and record a video summary to explain the research objectives and the topic’s significance to a lay audience. By the end of this module, students will be prepared to carry out their MSc research project.\nPlanetary Health IVES 727\nPlanetary Health is defined as “the health of human civilization and the natural systems on which it depends”. Consequently, this module will train you in broader skills such as taking a holistic and interrelated approach to health, studying how the health of humans, non-human animals, our climate, and ecology are all linked and affect each other. By recognising this interrelatedness, you will be able to answer more complex and long-term health questions such as: How do climate change and animal movements affect the distribution and interaction between humans, animals and their diseases? And how do land use change and biodiversity loss affect ecology and climate? In short, you will be trained to consider the bigger picture to answer specific health questions. The course concludes with a focus on response and mitigation – specifically, how policymakers need to consider the full range of interconnected facets, and work both locally and globally to address these global challenges. As part of this, you will gain skills in interpreting and evaluating government policy documents.\nOne Health IVES 715\nThis module will introduce students to interdisciplinary approaches to tackling disease from a collaborative One Health perspective. The module will train students in how One Health approaches can be used to address complex health challenges by considering human-animal-environment interactions. It will equip you with the skillset to develop and evaluate One Health research and policy. Key focus areas within the module include emerging infectious diseases involving animals (i.e. zoonoses) food security and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) as well as examining how the success of One Health disease control programmes can be monitored and evaluated. The principles and techniques will be taught using lectures, seminars with practical opportunities for skills development during the module workshops.Opportunities for active participation will build confidence in the cornerstones of One Health cross-sectoral working including collaboration, co-ordination, communication and capacity building.This course will foster One Health graduates equipped to make an impactful contribution to global citizenship.\nBiological Data skills LIFE707\nData skills are essential for a career in modern biology. Biological studies increasingly involve the generation of large or complex sets of data, and the ability to analyse data is a core component of a successful biologist’s skill set. Digital fluency is also required more widely outside biological research and a grounding in data analysis is in demand by a broad range of employers. Here you will learn the ability to visualise data, critically test hypotheses, and to interpret and present results.The module will also introduce students to the powerful open access statistical software package, R.For any students studying off-campus – due to a placement in industry or studying at an overseas University – on-line drop-in sessions will be provided instead of the practical workshops.\n\n\nModules listed are subject to approval – the full module structure for this course will be available soon.\n\n\n\nModules\n\n\n\n\nCompulsory modules\nCredits\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n                                                                    BIOLOGICAL DATA SKILLS (LIFE707)\r\n                                                                \n\n15\n\n\n\n\r\n                                                                    INTRODUCTION TO IVES RESEARCH (IVES701)\r\n                                                                \n\n30\n\n\n\n\nProgramme details and modules listed are illustrative only and subject to change.\n\n\n\n\nSemester two\n\n\nSemester two compulsory modules:\n\nMapping for Planetary and One Health IVES728\nThis module offers students with a unique opportunity to explore the powerful intersection of geography, human and animal health, climate and environment, and technology. It will equip them with key knowledge, skills, and techniques for investigating and mapping complex spatial variations and interactions. This is critically important and timely, as climate change is projected to influence disease distributions and increase the frequency of outbreaks.Students will gain hands-on experience with geographical information systems (GIS), spatial analytical methods, and the creation of maps that can inform health policies and interventions and help to mitigate the impact of the global threats. No previous knowledge is required, as the module’s active-learning approach ensures that students will gain the practical experience working with real-world data, and become able to process and evaluate covered topics.\nGlobal Outbreak Surveillance and Control IVES717\nThis is a key module for students with an interest in developing knowledge, skills, and techniques for investigating and controlling global human and animal disease outbreaks. The module is topical and timely, in light of the recent pandemic and will provide students with an opportunity to deal with the different phases and complexities of outbreaks at global, national, and local levels, from the start to finish using a variety of relevant exemplars. The module comprises lectures, seminars, and workshops led by leading academics, and external key stakeholders with expertise in detection, control, surveillance, communication, governance, policy, bioinformatics, economic and community engagement applications, all integral to the investigation of, and control of outbreaks. The module uses active-learning delivery methods to ensure students can process and evaluate the topics, and has three assessments aimed at developing knowledge and skills in infographics, verbal communication and written reports.\nUnderstanding Models and Data IVES724\nIn recent years, data and statistics have become a feature of emerging public health situations to an extent that is historically unprecedented. Scientists, policy makers and the public have had to become confident consumers of numbers and model predictions. The actors involved in the management of infectious diseases are not necessarily modelling specialists themselves, but nevertheless need to interpret statistical and modelling results and be aware of their limitations.This module will train students to understand what can and cannot be learnt from data and modelling results. The module does not assume that students are experts in statistics or modelling. Students will receive training in how to use simple visualisations and analysis to gain a robust understanding of key patterns in data, and how to recognise common pitfalls in data interpretation. Students will learn the distinction between different approaches in statistics and quantitative modelling, and when it is appropriate to use them. Particular attention will be paid to the management of uncertainty in model predictions. The module will equip students to interpret critically the quantitative results in scientific papers and reports, and how to use them to inform the management of infectious diseases.\n\n\nModules listed are subject to approval – the full module structure for this course will be available soon.\n\n\n\nModules\n\n\n\n\nCompulsory modules\nCredits\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n                                                                    UNDERSTANDING MODELS AND DATA (IVES724)\r\n                                                                \n\n15\n\n\n\n\nProgramme details and modules listed are illustrative only and subject to change.\n\n\n\n\nFinal project\n\n\nIVES Research Project IVES702\nThis module offers students the exciting opportunity to conduct an independent research project related to their chosen area of study under academic guidance.
