This means that they think and act along interdisciplinary lines and view entire systems from a scientific, sociological and technical perspective. Agricultural sciences are based on mathematics, natural and social sciences, which is why we require you to have an appropriate profile when applying.\nGraduates of the Master's level have theoretical and methodological skills as well as social competences for entering a professional or academic career. Possible places of employment are research institutes, consulting firms, international organisations, food companies and other service providers.\nAgricultural scientists develop concepts for ecological, economic and socially acceptable food production, whether in Switzerland or in various regions of the world.\n120 ECTS | 2 years\nMaster of Science ETH in Agricultural Sciences\nDownload MSc Agricultural Sciences (PDF, 277 KB)\nMaster’s degree programme in Agricultural Sciences\nETH Zurich\n                    Department of Environmental Systems Science\n                    Universitätstrasse 2\n                LFW C 13.1\n                8092 \n                Zurich\n            Switzerland\n• Homepage\n• Navigation\n• Search\n• Content\n• Footer\n• Contact\n• Sitemap\n• Agricultural Economics\n• Animal Sciences\n• Plant Sciences\n• Phone\n                        +41 44 632 38 93\n[CARD]\nContact\nDr. Emma Lindberg\n\n\n\nPhone\n                        +41 44 632 38 93\n\n\n\n\n\n            ETH Zurich\n                    Department of Environmental Systems Science\n                    Universitätstrasse 2\n                LFW C 13.1\n                8092 \n                Zurich\n            Switzerland\n\n\n\n\n\n              Show more\n\n              Show less\n[CARD]\nContact\n[CARD]\nDr. Emma Lindberg\n\n\n\nPhone\n                        +41 44 632 38 93\n\n\n\n\n\n            ETH Zurich\n                    Department of Environmental Systems Science\n                    Universitätstrasse 2\n                LFW C 13.1\n                8092 \n                Zurich\n            Switzerland\n\n\n\n\n\n              Show more\n\n              Show less\n[CARD]\nDr. Emma Lindberg\n[CARD]\nPhone\n                        +41 44 632 38 93\n[CARD]\nETH Zurich\n                    Department of Environmental Systems Science\n                    Universitätstrasse 2\n                LFW C 13.1\n                8092 \n                Zurich\n            Switzerland\n[CARD]\nShow more\n\n              Show less",
