We imagine alternate futures, disrupt thinking and play with data as a material.\nOur practice is experimental, speculative and critical, informed through research and industry. We create inquisitive, professional and articulate problem solvers and entrepreneurs as graduates, leading applied data-driven futures with a global reach.\nWe play with making physical and digital artefacts and experimental data things. We build, test, hack and reinterpret what data means to society, and where design has opportunity to shape future thinking for challenge lead enquiry.\nDesign Informatics sits within the Institute of Design Informatics and is informed by research practice and industry partnerships across Edinburgh College of Art and School of Informatics.\nOffered as a joint programme between Edinburgh College of Art and School of Informatics, our ECA route offers the MA degree, and School of Informatics offers the MSc degree. Students will work together and complete the same courses during their degrees, with a few areas of difference including the final dissertation timetable. Both schools have different application requirements.\nRead more about the Design Informatics Masters on the programme website:\nPlease be aware that the structure of this programme may change.\nYou will work both individually and in collaborative teams of designers and computer scientists.\nDistinct to Design Informatics MA, our students work in parallel to our MSc students who bring experience from a largely computing science background. Together, our students create a novel, compelling and supportive environment to blend and explore applications for data thinking in design, reflective of an industry setting and real-world team experience.\nWithin this collaborative framework, everyone will learn to write code, make physical objects and consider theoretical concepts during the programme.\nSeveral courses, including the dissertation, will involve presenting an artefact, product, service, or interactive experience you have created to the public.\nMA students then complete their self-directed dissertation (60 credits).\nDesign Informatics is taught in a studio environment with a focus on practice-based and experiential learning. Supported by lecture series, workshops and seminars, students will develop their own individual and group projects with one-to-one support from tutors.\nThe teachers and tutors that you will work with on the Design Informatics MA are a team of interdisciplinary design researchers and creative practitioners who will engage you in various forms of making, experimenting, reading, critiquing, evaluating and presenting novel technological and data-driven ideas and concepts.\nTechnical training is part of the core courses and forms the basis for developing expertise and knowledge in how to work with data, AI and physical computing to make new ideas a reality and engage various audiences with data.\nStudents across the Design Informatics MA and MSc cohorts will work together in a Design Informatics studio culture, and will form interdisciplinary teams to learn from each others’ design or computing science expertise.\nStudents are assessed through a combination of group work and individual activity.\nGroup work in the context of Design Informatics helps to support students working in multidisciplinary teams, and is an important part of our culture and professional practice. Learning with each other, making use of each-others’ skills in areas of design or data-science, adds to the student learning experience.\nIndependent work is required in some courses, and particularly for your final major project which is self-directed based on your interest and career intentions.\nWork is assessed through completion of a range of activities including workbooks, presentations, video documentation, portfolios, critical essays and reflective reports, as well as peer assessment of group projects.\nEach course in Design Informatics has a range of course-specific learning outcomes which follow key areas such as research, theory, practice, evaluation and communication. These differ from course to course and might cover outcomes like the following:\nOur students often progress to further study or research study with many of our students progressing to PhD locally or internationally.\nMany students take on roles in large organisations where their approach to innovation and working knowledge of design and data-science are sought after in industry.\nA growing proportion of students are interested in starting businesses, or further commercialising products, teams or ideas developed as part of Design Informatics study.\nStudents are regularly invited to join in wider Institute of Design Informatics research and innovation events to help prepare them for roles after graduation.\nThis programme will enable you to engage across a wide range of fields that exploit the intersection between:\nThe programme will open a host of opportunities in working with:\nFor those who wish to stay in academia, the course provides a solid foundation for a PhD in related areas.\nWe actively encourage entrepreneurship.\nWe run an annual field trip which will vary each year. The last few years have offered a trip to London to inspire students ahead of the final major project. This includes museum, gallery, university research lab visits, events and guided walks and is a hugely popular activity.\nAlternative field trips are available locally for those not able to travel. In previous years this has included visits to local beaches, sculpture parks, and museums with staff members.\nThe Design Informatics Studio is based in the Institute of Design Informatics, which houses the In-Space Gallery offering a regular programme of exhibitions, talks and events. The Design Informatics students form part of a rich and varied community and are active participants in the culture of the department.\nStudents have access to an on-site workshop including electronic facilities, laser cutting, 3D printing and other physical and digital making tools. In addition, students have access to wider ECA campus facilities with full metal, wood and model building workshops, large scale machineries and extensive digital fabrication facilities.\nThe Design Informatics Studio hosts workshops, seminars and practical tutorials as part of our courses.\nIn addition, students can use the Studio to continue to develop their own practice outside class time and work together on their projects in a shared studio environment.\nECA are excited to be undertaking a capital redevelopment of ECA’s Lauriston campus over the next 3 years, from April 2024 to April 2027.\nThe project aims to maximise the use of existing space, improve accessibility, and create a vibrant campus that fosters collaboration and innovation.\nThe project involves refurbishing and repurposing various spaces across the Lauriston campus, including technical facilities, student and teaching spaces, and the relocation of the Reid School of Music from Alison House to the Lauriston campus. New social spaces, seminar rooms, and studios are being created to accommodate our growing community.\nYou can find more about the project at the below link:\nBuilding work starts at ECA’s Lauriston campus | Edinburgh College of Art\nThese entry requirements are for the 2025/26 academic year and requirements for future academic years may differ.

We imagine alternate futures, disrupt thinking and play with data as a material.\nOur practice is experimental, speculative and critical, informed through research and industry. We create inquisitive, professional and articulate problem solvers and entrepreneurs as graduates, leading applied data-driven futures with a global reach.\nWe play with making physical and digital artefacts and experimental data things. We build, test, hack and reinterpret what data means to society, and where design has opportunity to shape future thinking for challenge lead enquiry.\nDesign Informatics sits within the Institute of Design Informatics and is informed by research practice and industry partnerships across Edinburgh College of Art and School of Informatics.\nOffered as a joint programme between Edinburgh College of Art and School of Informatics, our ECA route offers the MA degree, and School of Informatics offers the MSc degree. Students will work together and complete the same courses during their degrees, with a few areas of difference including the final dissertation timetable. Both schools have different application requirements.\nRead more about the Design Informatics Masters on the programme website:\n\nDesign Informatics Masters\nPlease be aware that the structure of this programme may change.\nYou will work both individually and in collaborative teams of designers and computer scientists.\nDistinct to Design Informatics MA, our students work in parallel to our MSc students who bring experience from a largely computing science background. Together, our students create a novel, compelling and supportive environment to blend and explore applications for data thinking in design, reflective of an industry setting and real-world team experience.\nWithin this collaborative framework, everyone will learn to write code, make physical objects and consider theoretical concepts during the programme.\nSeveral courses, including the dissertation, will involve presenting an artefact, product, service, or interactive experience you have created to the public.\nWhat you will study\n\nHistories and Futures of Technologies (20 credits) \nData Science for Design (20 credits) \nCase Studies in Design Informatics (20 credits) \nDesign with Data (20 credits) \n40 credits of optional courses\n\nMA students then complete their self-directed dissertation (60 credits).\nTeaching\nDesign Informatics is taught in a studio environment with a focus on practice-based and experiential learning. Supported by lecture series, workshops and seminars, students will develop their own individual and group projects with one-to-one support from tutors.\nThe teachers and tutors that you will work with on the Design Informatics MA are a team of interdisciplinary design researchers and creative practitioners who will engage you in various forms of making, experimenting, reading, critiquing, evaluating and presenting novel technological and data-driven ideas and concepts.\nTechnical training is part of the core courses and forms the basis for developing expertise and knowledge in how to work with data, AI and physical computing to make new ideas a reality and engage various audiences with data.\nStudents across the Design Informatics MA and MSc cohorts will work together in a Design Informatics studio culture, and will form interdisciplinary teams to learn from each others’ design or computing science expertise.\nAssessment\nStudents are assessed through a combination of group work and individual activity.\nGroup work in the context of Design Informatics helps to support students working in multidisciplinary teams, and is an important part of our culture and professional practice. Learning with each other, making use of each-others’ skills in areas of design or data-science, adds to the student learning experience.\nIndependent work is required in some courses, and particularly for your final major project which is self-directed based on your interest and career intentions.\nWork is assessed through completion of a range of activities including workbooks, presentations, video documentation, portfolios, critical essays and reflective reports, as well as peer assessment of group projects.\nEach course in Design Informatics has a range of course-specific learning outcomes which follow key areas such as research, theory, practice, evaluation and communication. These differ from course to course and might cover outcomes like the following:\n\nInvestigate and apply critical theories through a practical interactive digital media project. \nDemonstrate the initiation and evaluation of original creative concepts in response to research findings through critical assessment.\nUse digital media to design and develop, critical, conceptual and experimental approaches to problem solving.\nSelect appropriate and innovative approaches for communicating the key findings, development of products, systems or services developed during your taught postgraduate studies.\nOur students often progress to further study or research study with many of our students progressing to PhD locally or internationally.\nMany students take on roles in large organisations where their approach to innovation and working knowledge of design and data-science are sought after in industry.\nA growing proportion of students are interested in starting businesses, or further commercialising products, teams or ideas developed as part of Design Informatics study.\nStudents are regularly invited to join in wider Institute of Design Informatics research and innovation events to help prepare them for roles after graduation.\nThis programme will enable you to engage across a wide range of fields that exploit the intersection between:\n\ndata science \ndesign \ninformation technology \nexperience and immersive design \nprogrammable matter.\n\nThe programme will open a host of opportunities in working with:\n\ncompanies \ncharities \nthe public sector.\n\nFor those who wish to stay in academia, the course provides a solid foundation for a PhD in related areas.\nWe actively encourage entrepreneurship.\nField trips\nWe run an annual field trip which will vary each year. The last few years have offered a trip to London to inspire students ahead of the final major project. This includes museum, gallery, university research lab visits, events and guided walks and is a hugely popular activity.\nAlternative field trips are available locally for those not able to travel.

We imagine alternate futures, disrupt thinking and play with data as a material.\nOur practice is experimental, speculative and critical, informed through research and industry. We create inquisitive, professional and articulate problem solvers and entrepreneurs as graduates, leading applied data-driven futures with a global reach.\nWe play with making physical and digital artefacts and experimental data things. We build, test, hack and reinterpret what data means to society, and where design has opportunity to shape future thinking for challenge lead enquiry.\nDesign Informatics sits within the Institute of Design Informatics and is informed by research practice and industry partnerships across Edinburgh College of Art and School of Informatics.\nOffered as a joint programme between Edinburgh College of Art and School of Informatics, our ECA route offers the MA degree, and School of Informatics offers the MSc degree. Students will work together and complete the same courses during their degrees, with a few areas of difference including the final dissertation timetable. Both schools have different application requirements.\nRead more about the Design Informatics Masters on the programme website:\n\nDesign Informatics Masters\nPlease be aware that the structure of this programme may change.\nYou will work both individually and in collaborative teams of designers and computer scientists.\nDistinct to Design Informatics MA, our students work in parallel to our MSc students who bring experience from a largely computing science background. Together, our students create a novel, compelling and supportive environment to blend and explore applications for data thinking in design, reflective of an industry setting and real-world team experience.\nWithin this collaborative framework, everyone will learn to write code, make physical objects and consider theoretical concepts during the programme.\nSeveral courses, including the dissertation, will involve presenting an artefact, product, service, or interactive experience you have created to the public.\nWhat you will study\n\nHistories and Futures of Technologies (20 credits) \nData Science for Design (20 credits) \nCase Studies in Design Informatics (20 credits) \nDesign with Data (20 credits) \n40 credits of optional courses\n\nMA students then complete their self-directed dissertation (60 credits).\nTeaching\nDesign Informatics is taught in a studio environment with a focus on practice-based and experiential learning. Supported by lecture series, workshops and seminars, students will develop their own individual and group projects with one-to-one support from tutors.\nThe teachers and tutors that you will work with on the Design Informatics MA are a team of interdisciplinary design researchers and creative practitioners who will engage you in various forms of making, experimenting, reading, critiquing, evaluating and presenting novel technological and data-driven ideas and concepts.\nTechnical training is part of the core courses and forms the basis for developing expertise and knowledge in how to work with data, AI and physical computing to make new ideas a reality and engage various audiences with data.\nStudents across the Design Informatics MA and MSc cohorts will work together in a Design Informatics studio culture, and will form interdisciplinary teams to learn from each others’ design or computing science expertise.\nAssessment\nStudents are assessed through a combination of group work and individual activity.\nGroup work in the context of Design Informatics helps to support students working in multidisciplinary teams, and is an important part of our culture and professional practice. Learning with each other, making use of each-others’ skills in areas of design or data-science, adds to the student learning experience.\nIndependent work is required in some courses, and particularly for your final major project which is self-directed based on your interest and career intentions.\nWork is assessed through completion of a range of activities including workbooks, presentations, video documentation, portfolios, critical essays and reflective reports, as well as peer assessment of group projects.\nEach course in Design Informatics has a range of course-specific learning outcomes which follow key areas such as research, theory, practice, evaluation and communication. These differ from course to course and might cover outcomes like the following:\n\nInvestigate and apply critical theories through a practical interactive digital media project. \nDemonstrate the initiation and evaluation of original creative concepts in response to research findings through critical assessment.\nUse digital media to design and develop, critical, conceptual and experimental approaches to problem solving.\nSelect appropriate and innovative approaches for communicating the key findings, development of products, systems or services developed during your taught postgraduate studies.\nOur students often progress to further study or research study with many of our students progressing to PhD locally or internationally.\nMany students take on roles in large organisations where their approach to innovation and working knowledge of design and data-science are sought after in industry.\nA growing proportion of students are interested in starting businesses, or further commercialising products, teams or ideas developed as part of Design Informatics study.\nStudents are regularly invited to join in wider Institute of Design Informatics research and innovation events to help prepare them for roles after graduation.\nThis programme will enable you to engage across a wide range of fields that exploit the intersection between:\n\ndata science \ndesign \ninformation technology \nexperience and immersive design \nprogrammable matter.\n\nThe programme will open a host of opportunities in working with:\n\ncompanies \ncharities \nthe public sector.\n\nFor those who wish to stay in academia, the course provides a solid foundation for a PhD in related areas.\nWe actively encourage entrepreneurship.\nField trips\nWe run an annual field trip which will vary each year. The last few years have offered a trip to London to inspire students ahead of the final major project. This includes museum, gallery, university research lab visits, events and guided walks and is a hugely popular activity.\nAlternative field trips are available locally for those not able to travel. In previous years this has included visits to local beaches, sculpture parks, and museums with staff members.\nCampus facilities\nThe Design Informatics Studio is based in the Institute of Design Informatics, which houses the In-Space Gallery offering a regular programme of exhibitions, talks and events. The Design Informatics students form part of a rich and varied community and are active participants in the culture of the department.\nStudents have access to an on-site workshop including electronic facilities, laser cutting, 3D printing and other physical and digital making tools. In addition, students have access to wider ECA campus facilities with full metal, wood and model building workshops, large scale machineries and extensive digital fabrication facilities.\nThe Design Informatics Studio hosts workshops, seminars and practical tutorials as part of our courses.\nIn addition, students can use the Studio to continue to develop their own practice outside class time and work together on their projects in a shared studio environment.\nLauriston campus redevelopment\nECA are excited to be undertaking a capital redevelopment of ECA’s Lauriston campus over the next 3 years, from April 2024 to April 2027.\nThe project aims to maximise the use of existing space, improve accessibility, and create a vibrant campus that fosters collaboration and innovation.\nThe project involves refurbishing and repurposing various spaces across the Lauriston campus, including technical facilities, student and teaching spaces, and the relocation of the Reid School of Music from Alison House to the Lauriston campus. New social spaces, seminar rooms, and studios are being created to accommodate our growing community.\nYou can find more about the project at the below link:\nBuilding work starts at ECA’s Lauriston campus | Edinburgh College of Art\nThese entry requirements are for the 2025/26 academic year and requirements for future academic years may differ.

We imagine alternate futures, disrupt thinking and play with data as a material.\nOur practice is experimental, speculative and critical, informed through research and industry. We create inquisitive, professional and articulate problem solvers and entrepreneurs as graduates, leading applied data-driven futures with a global reach.\nWe play with making physical and digital artefacts and experimental data things. We build, test, hack and reinterpret what data means to society, and where design has opportunity to shape future thinking for challenge lead enquiry.\nDesign Informatics sits within the Institute of Design Informatics and is informed by research practice and industry partnerships across Edinburgh College of Art and School of Informatics.\nOffered as a joint programme between Edinburgh College of Art and School of Informatics, our ECA route offers the MA degree, and School of Informatics offers the MSc degree.

Together, our students create a novel, compelling and supportive environment to blend and explore applications for data thinking in design, reflective of an industry setting and real-world team experience.\nWithin this collaborative framework, everyone will learn to write code, make physical objects and consider theoretical concepts during the programme.\nSeveral courses, including the dissertation, will involve presenting an artefact, product, service, or interactive experience you have created to the public.\nWhat you will study\n\nHistories and Futures of Technologies (20 credits) \nData Science for Design (20 credits) \nCase Studies in Design Informatics (20 credits) \nDesign with Data (20 credits) \n40 credits of optional courses\n\nMA students then complete their self-directed dissertation (60 credits).\nTeaching\nDesign Informatics is taught in a studio environment with a focus on practice-based and experiential learning. Supported by lecture series, workshops and seminars, students will develop their own individual and group projects with one-to-one support from tutors.\nThe teachers and tutors that you will work with on the Design Informatics MA are a team of interdisciplinary design researchers and creative practitioners who will engage you in various forms of making, experimenting, reading, critiquing, evaluating and presenting novel technological and data-driven ideas and concepts.\nTechnical training is part of the core courses and forms the basis for developing expertise and knowledge in how to work with data, AI and physical computing to make new ideas a reality and engage various audiences with data.\nStudents across the Design Informatics MA and MSc cohorts will work together in a Design Informatics studio culture, and will form interdisciplinary teams to learn from each others’ design or computing science expertise.\nAssessment\nStudents are assessed through a combination of group work and individual activity.\nGroup work in the context of Design Informatics helps to support students working in multidisciplinary teams, and is an important part of our culture and professional practice. Learning with each other, making use of each-others’ skills in areas of design or data-science, adds to the student learning experience.\nIndependent work is required in some courses, and particularly for your final major project which is self-directed based on your interest and career intentions.\nWork is assessed through completion of a range of activities including workbooks, presentations, video documentation, portfolios, critical essays and reflective reports, as well as peer assessment of group projects.\n[CARD]\nProgramme structure\nProgramme structure\n[CARD]\nProgramme structure\n[CARD]\nPlease be aware that the structure of this programme may change.\nYou will work both individually and in collaborative teams of designers and computer scientists.\nDistinct to Design Informatics MA, our students work in parallel to our MSc students who bring experience from a largely computing science background.

The last few years have offered a trip to London to inspire students ahead of the final major project. This includes museum, gallery, university research lab visits, events and guided walks and is a hugely popular activity.\nAlternative field trips are available locally for those not able to travel. In previous years this has included visits to local beaches, sculpture parks, and museums with staff members.\nCampus facilities\nThe Design Informatics Studio is based in the Institute of Design Informatics, which houses the In-Space Gallery offering a regular programme of exhibitions, talks and events. The Design Informatics students form part of a rich and varied community and are active participants in the culture of the department.\nStudents have access to an on-site workshop including electronic facilities, laser cutting, 3D printing and other physical and digital making tools. In addition, students have access to wider ECA campus facilities with full metal, wood and model building workshops, large scale machineries and extensive digital fabrication facilities.\nThe Design Informatics Studio hosts workshops, seminars and practical tutorials as part of our courses.\nIn addition, students can use the Studio to continue to develop their own practice outside class time and work together on their projects in a shared studio environment.\nLauriston campus redevelopment\nECA are excited to be undertaking a capital redevelopment of ECA’s Lauriston campus over the next 3 years, from April 2024 to April 2027.\nThe project aims to maximise the use of existing space, improve accessibility, and create a vibrant campus that fosters collaboration and innovation.\nThe project involves refurbishing and repurposing various spaces across the Lauriston campus, including technical facilities, student and teaching spaces, and the relocation of the Reid School of Music from Alison House to the Lauriston campus. New social spaces, seminar rooms, and studios are being created to accommodate our growing community.\nYou can find more about the project at the below link:\nBuilding work starts at ECA’s Lauriston campus | Edinburgh College of Art\n[CARD]\nField trips and campus facilities\nField trips and campus facilities\n[CARD]\nField trips and campus facilities\n[CARD]\nField trips\nWe run an annual field trip which will vary each year.

In addition, students have access to wider ECA campus facilities with full metal, wood and model building workshops, large scale machineries and extensive digital fabrication facilities.\nThe Design Informatics Studio hosts workshops, seminars and practical tutorials as part of our courses.\nIn addition, students can use the Studio to continue to develop their own practice outside class time and work together on their projects in a shared studio environment.\nLauriston campus redevelopment\nECA are excited to be undertaking a capital redevelopment of ECA’s Lauriston campus over the next 3 years, from April 2024 to April 2027.\nThe project aims to maximise the use of existing space, improve accessibility, and create a vibrant campus that fosters collaboration and innovation.\nThe project involves refurbishing and repurposing various spaces across the Lauriston campus, including technical facilities, student and teaching spaces, and the relocation of the Reid School of Music from Alison House to the Lauriston campus. New social spaces, seminar rooms, and studios are being created to accommodate our growing community.\nYou can find more about the project at the below link:\nBuilding work starts at ECA’s Lauriston campus | Edinburgh College of Art\n[CARD]\nEntry requirements\nThese entry requirements are for the 2025/26 academic year and requirements for future academic years may differ.

They are extremely hands-on, progressive and designed with industry at their heart. As a student, you’ll combine cutting-edge design with information hacking to develop products and services that will transform lives.\nThe central premise is that data is a medium for design: by shaping data, we shape the world around us. Data Science provides the groundwork for this, with Design Thinking underpinning reflective research through design. You will use this in working with the internet of things and physical computing, machine learning, speech and language technology, usable privacy and security, data ethics, blockchain technologies. You will connect technology with society, health, architecture, fashion, bio-design, craft, finance, tourism, and a host of other real world contexts, through case studies, individual, and collaborative projects. You will understand user experience in the wider socio-cultural context, through an agile programme of hacking, making and materialising new products and services.\nAs a designer… you will develop your ability to work with digital systems and computer scientists as well as taking your design practice in a new direction.\nAs a computer scientist… you will learn design methods, working alongside designers, and apply your computational skills to cutting edge creative projects.\nJust imagine what you can do together. . .\nThe DI Masters can be taken as a 1 year programme (180 credits): MA (based in the School of Design) or MSc (based in the School of Informatics).\nDuring the first semester (September to December) students attend lectures, tutorials and group practicals and acquire the creative practices and theoretical foundation to enable them to engage in independent research. In the second semester (December to March) the emphasis shifts to application of skills – individual and group projects on student-led themes. In the summer, students complete a dissertation, usually based on a design-related project.\nThe one year MA and MSc are standard UK masters programmes. They are ideal for those who wish to take a year out to develop the skills necessary to work with data as a designer or UX specialist and to build or enhance their portfolio of project work, and for students who are preparing to do a UK PhD.\nThe curriculum of the MA and MSc is largely identical. This reflects our emphasis on group work, and on learning skills from each other, which prepares you for the reality of Design and User Experience practice in mixed teams. The key differences between the two programmes are:\nStudents about studying the course\nFabian, MA Student 2013/14:\n“As an Interior Designer, this MA course offers me how to creatively expand the dialogue between body and place with current technologies and how to design theories about life for the future.”\nAlumnus Fionn Tynan-O’Mahony, Creative Lead, RBS on studying Design Informatics:\nI was studying at ECA during the merger with the University of Edinburgh and had heard about a potential joint venture between the School of Informatics and the School of Design. At the time, I was really intrigued because it blended a lot of the concepts I was interested in while studying product design – the evolving use of technology, the social implications of technology, experimenting with new ideas and use cases in both technology and design methods – but nothing seem to come of the rumours.\nA couple of years later, while doing a residency at the art college and thinking about further study, I heard about the masters course and it felt like a perfect blend of the ideas I had previously been excited about. It also felt very timely. A lot of product design was moving digital, and I felt it was important to build my skillset and understanding in that area.\nI think the most valuable thing I developed during my time at Design Informatics was a deepened, foundational understanding of the emerging tech and ideas at the centre of the tech industry (AI, IoT, Data, Blockchain, Crypto). Having the time and opportunity to explore both the technologies and the social conditions they create has allowed (and continues to allow) me to quickly navigate the current innovation landscape and identify new opportunities that I wouldn’t have been able to do previously.\nYes, definitely. During my Masters at Design Informatics, we had the opportunity to collaborate across disciplines on group projects, learn basic programming and had access to a broader range of modules from the university. Of course, the studio environment was also great for natural relationships and collaborations to emerge and a lot of the ideas and knowledge I gained were through those relationships with my peers. All of this brought a holistic perspective to what I was learning.\nI currently work in an environment where I communicate and collaborate with a range of stakeholders and disciplines everyday. From strategists to developers to business people. Without this experience, I would be much less effective at communicating and building relationships across these disciplines.\nHugely. I’m a designer that works in financial services. If I hadn’t studied the MA Design informatics, I don’t believe I would have made that move or connection. My relationship with my current employer also came about because of a direct relationship  between Design Informatics where I had the opportunity to meet new people and discuss new opportunities.\nWhile I still use a lot of straight-forward design tools and methods in my role, these are enhanced and made applicable to new areas and disciplines through the understanding I built during my time at Design Informatics.\nStudents and their projects\nOur current students work on a variety of different projects and also have the opportunity to connect to the Centre’s research projects which include events which have been part of the Edinburgh International Festival.\nThe course is based around the Design Informatics studio, situated in the Bayes Centre. The studio itself features a 3D printer, hacklab, soldering points and is equipped with a variety of technologies such as Arduinos, LEAP motion and 3D projectors. Students also have access to workshops in the Art College such as metal-work and woodwork. Students are also able to access equipment in the Informatics department, which includes a robotics lab. For working in a non-Design Informatics lab or workshop, you will typically require an induction and/or supervision by somebody who regularly works in that space.\nDo I need to have coding skills as an entry requirement?\nIf you come through the MSc route, you should be able to demonstrate solid programming skills. For the MA route, previous coding experience is not necessary. However, in both cases, you should be prepared to write your own code and create your own artefacts. If you have no experience, then working through an introductory Python tutorial before arriving is a good idea.\nIf you are interested in applying for one of our programmes, you can find information about entry requirements, tuition fees, funding, scholarships and the application procedure here:\nIf you have any further questions about the programmes, please contact the Programme Directors:\nMA: Bettina Nissen\nMSc: John Lee\nThe Institute for Design Informatics is home to a community of PhD students who are researching subjects that are associated with our core specialisms and use a variety of methods that combine theory and practice.\nThe Institute spans the School of Design (Edinburgh College of Art) and the School of Informatics, and supervision is supported by academic staff who are leaders in their fields from:\nStudents often work collaboratively with researchers in other departments and organisations beyond the Institute.

Communicating with data has become common and popular in modern life and data is always communicated with context. Comics as an ancient art is familiar to many people, and its unique visual richness could leverage the power of storytelling and data visualisations. However, creating data comics requires multiple skills within a complex procedure. Some resources provide theoretical and methodological support for creating data stories, data visualisations and comics. However, the process requires a considerable learning cost on understanding data comics and how to deliver effective communication with this format. This Ph.D. research investigates ways to understand data comics and its features; practice to explore potential applications; conduct workshops to evaluate creation methods and guidance. This research presents a conceptual model to demonstrate a stepwise creation process for data comics. The model implies important components, materials for supporting creation and criteria of assessing data comics.

Responding to this, in the last few years a huge number of ethical principles, frameworks and guidelines have been published, but it is difficult to assess how these translate into the context of real-world applications. Through interviews and ethnography, my research explores AI specialists’ values and their accounts of navigating the ethical and social impact of their work, seeking insight into which aspects impact ethical decision-making in AI system development. Having investigated behaviour of AI specialists as moral agents, my work going forward aims to explore how we can support meaningful applications of ethics in system design and development. More broadly, I am interested in the intersections between emerging technologies, moral psychology, intersectionality, moral philosophy and human-computer interaction.\nPhD students are provided desk space in the Design Informatics research office which is in the Bayes Centre of the University of Edinburgh. The research office is home to researchers, academics and a professional services team who work together to meet the demands of running masters and undergraduate courses, multiple funded research projects and public events. The Informatics Forum, which houses researchers, lecturers, and PhD students in the School of Informatics, is fully accessible to all Design Informatics staff and students.\nThe research office is located above the design studios for the Design Informatics Masters Programme. This houses its own dedicated workshop featuring 3D printers, laser cutting, soldering points and tools for light assembly, and is equipped with a variety of technologies such as Arduinos, LEAP motion and 3D projectors. Students also have access to workshops in the Edinburgh Art College such as metalwork and woodwork. Students are also able to access equipment in the School of Informatics, which includes a robotics lab, a Virtual Realisty studio, and its own maker space. For working in a non-Design Informatics lab or workshop, you will typically require an induction and/or supervision by somebody who regularly works in that space.\nClose to the design studios is Inspace, a bespoke gallery and public engagement space for fostering creativity and interdisciplinarity through data-driven innovation. PhD students regularly use this for running events, exhibitions or hosting collaborators related to their studies.\nThe Institute for Design Informatics runs a series of activities that we strongly encourage our PhD students to proactively engage in:\nDesign Informatics and BRAID research seminars\nThe Design Informatics Research Seminar series was established in 2012 and has featured a series of high-profile international speakers. At the moment, we co-run these seminars with the AHRC BRAID responsible AI programme, which is co-led by our institute. The weekly talks programme is open to Staff (research, teaching and technical), Resident Entrepreneurs and Students, University of Edinburgh researchers and visitors. Talks are delivered by invited speakers from all around the world as well as University of Edinburgh staff who are involved with social, technical and environmental research that relates to Design Informatics in its broadest sense.\nDesign Informatics Research Bytes and Creative Circles sessions\nEach week we run a Research Byte or a Creative Circles session. These are more informal than our research seminars, and are typically kept to just members of the Institute for Design Informatics to participate in. The Research Bytes typically involve short talks or activities led by design informatics members, sharing their projects or to open up a topic for discussion. The Creative Circles are more focused on sharing of practice-led projects and to have a shared space for sharing of work that involves creative and design practice. We hold these different weekly events to make opportunities for members across the institute to connect, share and talk in a social space about their work.\nDesign Informatics PhD community events\nWe have an active PhD community within the institute, who self-organise a regular series of get-togethers and gatherings to ensure students come together to discuss their studies. These events are student led, and the nature of what they focus on changes over time. Examples include sessions where PhD students have invited academics or industry collaborators to come and talk about post-PhD careers, or skills-sharing workshops, or show and tells about research, or practice talks for upcoming conference presentations.\nIf you are interested in pursuing a PhD within the Institute for Design Informatics you are welcome to contact staff within the Institute through the supervisors’ page.\nThe Institute spans the Edinburgh College of Art and the School of Informatics, and entry to the PhD programmes is made directly through each School, depending on which school your primary supervisor is based within.\nFor Edinburgh College of Art based supervisors, PhD applicants would typically apply for the Design PhD / MPhil programme: https://postgraduate.degrees.ed.ac.uk/?r=site/view&edition=2025&id=753\nFor School of Informatics based supervisors, PhD applicants would typically apply for the ILCC PhD / MScR programme: https://postgraduate.degrees.ed.ac.uk/?r=site/view&edition=2024&id=491\nEach School will also have its own studentship competitions advertised each year (typically with deadlines in early Winter each year).\nIf you would like any help in identifying an appropriate supervisor within the Institute for Design Informatics, please contact Frauke Zeller (Institute Co-Director, ECA) and John Vines (Institute Co-Director, Informatics) who will try to direct you to appropriate academics.\n• MSc overview\n• PhD overview\n• Programme\n• Student Voices\n• Facilities / FAQ\n• Apply / Contact\n• Histories and Futures of Technology: Cultural and technical context for Design Informatics.

They are extremely hands-on, progressive and designed with industry at their heart. As a student, you’ll combine cutting-edge design with information hacking to develop products and services that will transform lives. \nThe central premise is that data is a medium for design: by shaping data, we shape the world around us. Data Science provides the groundwork for this, with Design Thinking underpinning reflective research through design. You will use this in working with the internet of things and physical computing, machine learning, speech and language technology, usable privacy and security, data ethics, blockchain technologies. You will connect technology with society, health, architecture, fashion, bio-design, craft, finance, tourism, and a host of other real world contexts, through case studies, individual, and collaborative projects. You will understand user experience in the wider socio-cultural context, through an agile programme of hacking, making and materialising new products and services. \nAs a designer… you will develop your ability to work with digital systems and computer scientists as well as taking your design practice in a new direction.\nAs a computer scientist… you will learn design methods, working alongside designers, and apply your computational skills to cutting edge creative projects.\nJust imagine what you can do together. . .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgramme \n\n\nStudent Voices \n\n\nFacilities / FAQ \n\n\nApply / Contact\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe DI Masters can be taken as a 1 year programme (180 credits): MA (based in the School of Design) or MSc (based in the School of Informatics).\nDuring the first semester (September to December) students attend lectures, tutorials and group practicals and acquire the creative practices and theoretical foundation to enable them to engage in independent research. In the second semester (December to March) the emphasis shifts to application of skills – individual and group projects on student-led themes. In the summer, students complete a dissertation, usually based on a design-related project.\n\nCourses:\n\nHistories and Futures of Technology: Cultural and technical context for Design Informatics.

They are ideal for those who wish to take a year out to develop the skills necessary to work with data as a designer or UX specialist and to build or enhance their portfolio of project work, and for students who are preparing to do a UK PhD.\n \nMA or MSc?\nThe curriculum of the MA and MSc is largely identical. This reflects our emphasis on group work, and on learning skills from each other, which prepares you for the reality of Design and User Experience practice in mixed teams. The key differences between the two programmes are:\n\nMSc students can ‘test out’ of the Year 1 course of Data Science for Design, if they can prove a high level of relevant programming and data science skills.\nDissertations are judged on different scales – the MA dissertations have more scope for creative practice.\n\n\n\nStudents about studying the course\nFabian, MA Student 2013/14:\n“As an Interior Designer, this MA course offers me how to creatively expand the dialogue between body and place with current technologies and how to design theories about life for the future.”\nAlumnus Fionn Tynan-O’Mahony, Creative Lead, RBS on studying Design Informatics:\n\nWhy did you decide to apply to study Design Informatics at Edinburgh College of Art?\n\nI was studying at ECA during the merger with the University of Edinburgh and had heard about a potential joint venture between the School of Informatics and the School of Design. At the time, I was really intrigued because it blended a lot of the concepts I was interested in while studying product design – the evolving use of technology, the social implications of technology, experimenting with new ideas and use cases in both technology and design methods – but nothing seem to come of the rumours.\nA couple of years later, while doing a residency at the art college and thinking about further study, I heard about the masters course and it felt like a perfect blend of the ideas I had previously been excited about. It also felt very timely. A lot of product design was moving digital, and I felt it was important to build my skillset and understanding in that area.\n\nWhat are the most valuable things you learned during the course?\n\nI think the most valuable thing I developed during my time at Design Informatics was a deepened, foundational understanding of the emerging tech and ideas at the centre of the tech industry (AI, IoT, Data, Blockchain, Crypto).

Through interviews and ethnography, my research explores AI specialists’ values and their accounts of navigating the ethical and social impact of their work, seeking insight into which aspects impact ethical decision-making in AI system development. Having investigated behaviour of AI specialists as moral agents, my work going forward aims to explore how we can support meaningful applications of ethics in system design and development. More broadly, I am interested in the intersections between emerging technologies, moral psychology, intersectionality, moral philosophy and human-computer interaction. \n\n\nFacilities / Culture\n\nPhD students are provided desk space in the Design Informatics research office which is in the Bayes Centre of the University of Edinburgh. The research office is home to researchers, academics and a professional services team who work together to meet the demands of running masters and undergraduate courses, multiple funded research projects and public events. The Informatics Forum, which houses researchers, lecturers, and PhD students in the School of Informatics, is fully accessible to all Design Informatics staff and students.  \nThe research office is located above the design studios for the Design Informatics Masters Programme. This houses its own dedicated workshop featuring 3D printers, laser cutting, soldering points and tools for light assembly, and is equipped with a variety of technologies such as Arduinos, LEAP motion and 3D projectors. Students also have access to workshops in the Edinburgh Art College such as metalwork and woodwork. Students are also able to access equipment in the School of Informatics, which includes a robotics lab, a Virtual Realisty studio, and its own maker space. For working in a non-Design Informatics lab or workshop, you will typically require an induction and/or supervision by somebody who regularly works in that space.  \nClose to the design studios is Inspace, a bespoke gallery and public engagement space for fostering creativity and interdisciplinarity through data-driven innovation. PhD students regularly use this for running events, exhibitions or hosting collaborators related to their studies. \n\n\n\nThe Institute for Design Informatics runs a series of activities that we strongly encourage our PhD students to proactively engage in: \nDesign Informatics and BRAID research seminars\nThe Design Informatics Research Seminar series was established in 2012 and has featured a series of high-profile international speakers. At the moment, we co-run these seminars with the AHRC BRAID responsible AI programme, which is co-led by our institute. The weekly talks programme is open to Staff (research, teaching and technical), Resident Entrepreneurs and Students, University of Edinburgh researchers and visitors. Talks are delivered by invited speakers from all around the world as well as University of Edinburgh staff who are involved with social, technical and environmental research that relates to Design Informatics in its broadest sense.  \nDesign Informatics Research Bytes and Creative Circles sessions\nEach week we run a Research Byte or a Creative Circles session. These are more informal than our research seminars, and are typically kept to just members of the Institute for Design Informatics to participate in. The Research Bytes typically involve short talks or activities led by design informatics members, sharing their projects or to open up a topic for discussion. The Creative Circles are more focused on sharing of practice-led projects and to have a shared space for sharing of work that involves creative and design practice. We hold these different weekly events to make opportunities for members across the institute to connect, share and talk in a social space about their work.   \nDesign Informatics PhD community events\nWe have an active PhD community within the institute, who self-organise a regular series of get-togethers and gatherings to ensure students come together to discuss their studies. These events are student led, and the nature of what they focus on changes over time. Examples include sessions where PhD students have invited academics or industry collaborators to come and talk about post-PhD careers, or skills-sharing workshops, or show and tells about research, or practice talks for upcoming conference presentations.\n\n\nHow to Apply \n\nIf you are interested in pursuing a PhD within the Institute for Design Informatics you are welcome to contact staff within the Institute through the supervisors’ page.  \nThe Institute spans the Edinburgh College of Art and the School of Informatics, and entry to the PhD programmes is made directly through each School, depending on which school your primary supervisor is based within. \nFor Edinburgh College of Art based supervisors, PhD applicants would typically apply for the Design PhD / MPhil programme: https://postgraduate.degrees.ed.ac.uk/?r=site/view&edition=2025&id=753  \nFor School of Informatics based supervisors, PhD applicants would typically apply for the ILCC PhD / MScR programme: https://postgraduate.degrees.ed.ac.uk/?r=site/view&edition=2024&id=491  \nEach School will also have its own studentship competitions advertised each year (typically with deadlines in early Winter each year). \nIf you would like any help in identifying an appropriate supervisor within the Institute for Design Informatics, please contact Frauke Zeller (Institute Co-Director, ECA) and John Vines (Institute Co-Director, Informatics) who will try to direct you to appropriate academics. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLINKS\n→ECA - School of Design→School of Informatics\nProgramme \n\n\nStudent Voices \n\n\nFacilities / FAQ \n\n\nApply / Contact\nProgramme\nStudent Voices\nFacilities / FAQ\nApply / Contact\nThe DI Masters can be taken as a 1 year programme (180 credits): MA (based in the School of Design) or MSc (based in the School of Informatics).\nDuring the first semester (September to December) students attend lectures, tutorials and group practicals and acquire the creative practices and theoretical foundation to enable them to engage in independent research. In the second semester (December to March) the emphasis shifts to application of skills – individual and group projects on student-led themes. In the summer, students complete a dissertation, usually based on a design-related project.\n\nCourses:\n\nHistories and Futures of Technology: Cultural and technical context for Design Informatics. Covers Digital Media, Critical Perspectives, Introduction to Arduino\nCase Studies in Design Informatics 1: Analysing Design Informatics case studies and learning research methodology\nData Science for Design: Introduction to data wrangling, data visualisation and Python programming with a design perspective\nProject Proposal: A compulsory dissertation preparation course for MSc students\nDesign with Data: Creating interactive pieces in small groups, working with an external organisation’s data.\nElective: one or two courses of your choice (see below)\n\nThe one year MA and MSc are standard UK masters programmes. They are ideal for those who wish to take a year out to develop the skills necessary to work with data as a designer or UX specialist and to build or enhance their portfolio of project work, and for students who are preparing to do a UK PhD.\n \nMA or MSc?\nThe curriculum of the MA and MSc is largely identical. This reflects our emphasis on group work, and on learning skills from each other, which prepares you for the reality of Design and User Experience practice in mixed teams. The key differences between the two programmes are:\n\nMSc students can ‘test out’ of the Year 1 course of Data Science for Design, if they can prove a high level of relevant programming and data science skills.\nDissertations are judged on different scales – the MA dissertations have more scope for creative practice.\n\n\n\nStudents about studying the course\nFabian, MA Student 2013/14:\n“As an Interior Designer, this MA course offers me how to creatively expand the dialogue between body and place with current technologies and how to design theories about life for the future.”\nAlumnus Fionn Tynan-O’Mahony, Creative Lead, RBS on studying Design Informatics:\n\nWhy did you decide to apply to study Design Informatics at Edinburgh College of Art?\n\nI was studying at ECA during the merger with the University of Edinburgh and had heard about a potential joint venture between the School of Informatics and the School of Design. At the time, I was really intrigued because it blended a lot of the concepts I was interested in while studying product design – the evolving use of technology, the social implications of technology, experimenting with new ideas and use cases in both technology and design methods – but nothing seem to come of the rumours.\nA couple of years later, while doing a residency at the art college and thinking about further study, I heard about the masters course and it felt like a perfect blend of the ideas I had previously been excited about. It also felt very timely. A lot of product design was moving digital, and I felt it was important to build my skillset and understanding in that area.\n\nWhat are the most valuable things you learned during the course?\n\nI think the most valuable thing I developed during my time at Design Informatics was a deepened, foundational understanding of the emerging tech and ideas at the centre of the tech industry (AI, IoT, Data, Blockchain, Crypto). Having the time and opportunity to explore both the technologies and the social conditions they create has allowed (and continues to allow) me to quickly navigate the current innovation landscape and identify new opportunities that I wouldn’t have been able to do previously.\n\nDesign Informatics is a truly interdisciplinary subject. Has this been beneficial in your working life? How?\n\nYes, definitely. During my Masters at Design Informatics, we had the opportunity to collaborate across disciplines on group projects, learn basic programming and had access to a broader range of modules from the university. Of course, the studio environment was also great for natural relationships and collaborations to emerge and a lot of the ideas and knowledge I gained were through those relationships with my peers. All of this brought a holistic perspective to what I was learning.\nI currently work in an environment where I communicate and collaborate with a range of stakeholders and disciplines everyday. From strategists to developers to business people. Without this experience, I would be much less effective at communicating and building relationships across these disciplines.\n\nHow did studying Design Informatics influence your current job?\n\nHugely. I’m a designer that works in financial services. If I hadn’t studied the MA Design informatics, I don’t believe I would have made that move or connection. My relationship with my current employer also came about because of a direct relationship  between Design Informatics where I had the opportunity to meet new people and discuss new opportunities.\nWhile I still use a lot of straight-forward design tools and methods in my role, these are enhanced and made applicable to new areas and disciplines through the understanding I built during my time at Design Informatics.\n\n\nDesign Informatics Studio Space\nStudents and their projects\nOur current students work on a variety of different projects and also have the opportunity to connect to the Centre’s research projects which include events which have been part of the Edinburgh International Festival.\n \nFacilities & studios\nThe course is based around the Design Informatics studio, situated in the Bayes Centre. The studio itself features a 3D printer, hacklab, soldering points and is equipped with a variety of technologies such as Arduinos, LEAP motion and 3D projectors. Students also have access to workshops in the Art College such as metal-work and woodwork. Students are also able to access equipment in the Informatics department, which includes a robotics lab. For working in a non-Design Informatics lab or workshop, you will typically require an induction and/or supervision by somebody who regularly works in that space.\n\n\n\nFAQ\nDo I need to have coding skills as an entry requirement?\nIf you come through the MSc route, you should be able to demonstrate solid programming skills. For the MA route, previous coding experience is not necessary. However, in both cases, you should be prepared to write your own code and create your own artefacts. If you have no experience, then working through an introductory Python tutorial before arriving is a good idea.\n\n\nHow to Apply\nIf you are interested in applying for one of our programmes, you can find information about entry requirements, tuition fees, funding, scholarships and the application procedure here:\nMA \nMSc\nContact\nIf you have any further questions about the programmes, please contact the Programme Directors: \nMA: Bettina Nissen\nMSc: John Lee\nLINKS\n→ECA - School of Design→School of Informatics\nResearch Themes  \n\n\nSupervisors  \n\n\nProject examples  \n\n\nFacilities / Culture \n\n\nApply / Contact\nResearch Themes\nSupervisors\nProject examples\nFacilities / Culture\nApply / Contact\nResearch Themes\n\nThe Institute for Design Informatics is home to a series of sub-groups and Centres that have specific research interests. Whilst these are not prescriptive of all the research that takes place in the Institute, applicants are encouraged to consider how their project may fit within a group: \nInteraction Design\nDesign Informatics is always taking a practice-based design approach to research and academic colleagues are always interested in working with PhD students who are looking to creatively and critically explore new areas and design methods. Previous work and current research often links with existing design methods and aims to push the boundaries of new creative approaches and methodologies, some of which include Speculative Design, Critical Design, Design Fictions, Research through Design, Co-Design, Co-Creation, Participatory Design, Service Design, Socio-Economic Imaginaries, Unfinished Software, Tangible and Interaction Design methods.  \nAssociated Academics and Researchers:  \n\nDr. Bettina Nissen \nDr. Larissa Pschetz \nProf. John Vines\nDr. Susan Lechelt\n\n\nCreative Informatics \nCreative Informatics is an ambitious research and development programme based in The Institute for Design Informatics and is a central part of the Edinburgh Futures Institute. Creative Informatics is a large R&D programme that provides funding and development opportunities that enable creative individuals and organisations to explore how data can be used to drive ground-breaking new products, businesses and experiences. With partners at Edinburgh Napier University, Creative Edinburgh and Codebase, the programme seeks to understand and support how data-driven technologies are disrupting the creative industries.  \nAssociated Academics and Researchers:  \n\nProf. Chris Speed\nProf. Melissa Terras\nProf. Michael Rovatsos\nProf. Burkhard Shafer\nProf. Candace Jones\nDr. Chris Elsden\nDr. Susan Lechelt \n\n\nData Visualisation\nVisual+Interactive Data is a research group that investigates data visualisations and interactive means to make data more immediate, tangible, and understandable across a variety of media such as paper, screen, and immersive. Visual+Interactive Data is based at the Institute for Design Informatics and the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh. Our research includes, but is not limited to areas in: \n\nNetwork and spatio-temporal visualisation \nData-driven storytelling \nVisualisation in augmented and virtual reality (Immersive Analytics) \nNon-digital data physicalisation \nTeaching and learning visualisation \nSituated or embedded data experiences \n\nVisual+Interactive Data is heavily involved in co-organising Edinburgh’s Data Vis Meetup. \nAssociated Academics and Researchers:  \n\nDr. Bettina Nissen \nDr. Larissa Pschetz \n\n\nHealth and Care\nThe Institute has an established track record in research across Health Informatics. We have worked closely with eHealth and telehealth practitioners to establish a vision for a new product or service, implement it, and evaluate for whom it works, and under what circumstances.  \nThe Institute for Design Informatics is closely associated with the newly founded Advanced Centre for Care (ACRC). The ACRC will combine research across fields including medicine and other care professions, life sciences, engineering, informatics, data and social sciences. The Institute will enable data-driven, personalised and affordable care that delivers independence, dignity and a high quality of life for people living in their own homes or in supported care environments. \nAssociated Academics and Researchers:  \n\nDr. Larissa Pschetz\nProf. John Vines\n\n\n\nSupervisors\n\nAll PhD degrees require students to work closely with a supervision team. Please browse staff profiles to learn about the research specialisms and outputs for each staff within the Institute for Design Informatics. If your research is interdisciplinary, look at staff profiles in other subject areas, too. We encourage you to approach staff directly to gauge their availability and suitability as a prospective supervisor.  \nWhen making first contact with a prospective supervisor, please introduce yourself and mention your research intentions. If you maintain a website or online identity with research interests, please include a link.    \nThis helps potential supervisors to understand your vision of the scope of a PhD project, and your understanding of the type of practical – as well as intellectual – matters that postgraduate research entails. This early contact with staff should also be helpful to you, for decisions you will need to make about how to develop your proposal, and with whom you would like to work. \nBelow is an alphabetical list of academics affiliated with the Institute for Design Informatics who may be willing to take on PhD students: \n\nAlex Taylor \n\n\nAndrea Kocsis \n\n\nBettina Nissen \n\n\nCaterina Moruzzi \n\n\nChris Elsden \n\n\nEwa Luger \n\n\nFrauke Zeller \n\n\nJohn Lee \n\n\nJohn Vines \n\n\nLarissa Pschetz \n\n\nLynne Craig \n\n\nMelissa Terras \n\n\nRobin Hill \n\n\nRuby Marshall \n\n\nSarah Kettley \n\n\nSusan Lechelt \n\n\nTara Capel \n\n\nTed Koterwas \n\n\nUta Hinrichs \n\n \nOur institute also has academics who are affiliated with us, but based in Schools outside of Edinburgh College of Art and the School of Informatics: \n\nCara Wilson (Moray House School of Education) \n\n\nLachlan Urquhart (Edinburgh Law School) \n\n \n\n\nExamples of PhD Projects  \n\nZezhong Wang: Creating Data Comics for Data-Driven Storytelling \nSupervised by: Benjamin Bach, Dave Murray-Rust\nData comics are inspired by the visual language and narrative of comics, aiming to communicate the insight from data and visualisations. Communicating with data has become common and popular in modern life and data is always communicated with context. Comics as an ancient art is familiar to many people, and its unique visual richness could leverage the power of storytelling and data visualisations. However, creating data comics requires multiple skills within a complex procedure. Some resources provide theoretical and methodological support for creating data stories, data visualisations and comics. However, the process requires a considerable learning cost on understanding data comics and how to deliver effective communication with this format. This Ph.D. research investigates ways to understand data comics and its features; practice to explore potential applications; conduct workshops to evaluate creation methods and guidance. This research presents a conceptual model to demonstrate a stepwise creation process for data comics. The model implies important components, materials for supporting creation and criteria of assessing data comics. This report will present (i) an overview of works we have done so far, (ii) a work in progress as well as (iii) two planned projects. \n\nSarah Bennett: Towards ethical design in symbiotic human-machine systems \nSupervised by: Ewa Luger and Chris Speed \nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is being pervasively integrated into various domains, with serious social and ethical implications.

We have worked closely with eHealth and telehealth practitioners to establish a vision for a new product or service, implement it, and evaluate for whom it works, and under what circumstances.  \nThe Institute for Design Informatics is closely associated with the newly founded Advanced Centre for Care (ACRC). The ACRC will combine research across fields including medicine and other care professions, life sciences, engineering, informatics, data and social sciences. The Institute will enable data-driven, personalised and affordable care that delivers independence, dignity and a high quality of life for people living in their own homes or in supported care environments. \nAssociated Academics and Researchers:  \n\nDr. Larissa Pschetz\nProf. John Vines\n\n\n\nSupervisors\n\nAll PhD degrees require students to work closely with a supervision team. Please browse staff profiles to learn about the research specialisms and outputs for each staff within the Institute for Design Informatics. If your research is interdisciplinary, look at staff profiles in other subject areas, too. We encourage you to approach staff directly to gauge their availability and suitability as a prospective supervisor.  \nWhen making first contact with a prospective supervisor, please introduce yourself and mention your research intentions. If you maintain a website or online identity with research interests, please include a link.    \nThis helps potential supervisors to understand your vision of the scope of a PhD project, and your understanding of the type of practical – as well as intellectual – matters that postgraduate research entails. This early contact with staff should also be helpful to you, for decisions you will need to make about how to develop your proposal, and with whom you would like to work. \nBelow is an alphabetical list of academics affiliated with the Institute for Design Informatics who may be willing to take on PhD students: \n\nAlex Taylor \n\n\nAndrea Kocsis \n\n\nBettina Nissen \n\n\nCaterina Moruzzi \n\n\nChris Elsden \n\n\nEwa Luger \n\n\nFrauke Zeller \n\n\nJohn Lee \n\n\nJohn Vines \n\n\nLarissa Pschetz \n\n\nLynne Craig \n\n\nMelissa Terras \n\n\nRobin Hill \n\n\nRuby Marshall \n\n\nSarah Kettley \n\n\nSusan Lechelt \n\n\nTara Capel \n\n\nTed Koterwas \n\n\nUta Hinrichs \n\n \nOur institute also has academics who are affiliated with us, but based in Schools outside of Edinburgh College of Art and the School of Informatics: \n\nCara Wilson (Moray House School of Education) \n\n\nLachlan Urquhart (Edinburgh Law School) \n\n \n\n\nExamples of PhD Projects  \n\nZezhong Wang: Creating Data Comics for Data-Driven Storytelling \nSupervised by: Benjamin Bach, Dave Murray-Rust\nData comics are inspired by the visual language and narrative of comics, aiming to communicate the insight from data and visualisations. Communicating with data has become common and popular in modern life and data is always communicated with context. Comics as an ancient art is familiar to many people, and its unique visual richness could leverage the power of storytelling and data visualisations. However, creating data comics requires multiple skills within a complex procedure. Some resources provide theoretical and methodological support for creating data stories, data visualisations and comics. However, the process requires a considerable learning cost on understanding data comics and how to deliver effective communication with this format. This Ph.D. research investigates ways to understand data comics and its features; practice to explore potential applications; conduct workshops to evaluate creation methods and guidance. This research presents a conceptual model to demonstrate a stepwise creation process for data comics. The model implies important components, materials for supporting creation and criteria of assessing data comics. This report will present (i) an overview of works we have done so far, (ii) a work in progress as well as (iii) two planned projects. \n\nSarah Bennett: Towards ethical design in symbiotic human-machine systems \nSupervised by: Ewa Luger and Chris Speed \nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is being pervasively integrated into various domains, with serious social and ethical implications. Responding to this, in the last few years a huge number of ethical principles, frameworks and guidelines have been published, but it is difficult to assess how these translate into the context of real-world applications. Through interviews and ethnography, my research explores AI specialists’ values and their accounts of navigating the ethical and social impact of their work, seeking insight into which aspects impact ethical decision-making in AI system development. Having investigated behaviour of AI specialists as moral agents, my work going forward aims to explore how we can support meaningful applications of ethics in system design and development. More broadly, I am interested in the intersections between emerging technologies, moral psychology, intersectionality, moral philosophy and human-computer interaction. \n\n\nFacilities / Culture\n\nPhD students are provided desk space in the Design Informatics research office which is in the Bayes Centre of the University of Edinburgh. The research office is home to researchers, academics and a professional services team who work together to meet the demands of running masters and undergraduate courses, multiple funded research projects and public events. The Informatics Forum, which houses researchers, lecturers, and PhD students in the School of Informatics, is fully accessible to all Design Informatics staff and students.  \nThe research office is located above the design studios for the Design Informatics Masters Programme. This houses its own dedicated workshop featuring 3D printers, laser cutting, soldering points and tools for light assembly, and is equipped with a variety of technologies such as Arduinos, LEAP motion and 3D projectors. Students also have access to workshops in the Edinburgh Art College such as metalwork and woodwork. Students are also able to access equipment in the School of Informatics, which includes a robotics lab, a Virtual Realisty studio, and its own maker space. For working in a non-Design Informatics lab or workshop, you will typically require an induction and/or supervision by somebody who regularly works in that space.  \nClose to the design studios is Inspace, a bespoke gallery and public engagement space for fostering creativity and interdisciplinarity through data-driven innovation. PhD students regularly use this for running events, exhibitions or hosting collaborators related to their studies. \n\n\n\nThe Institute for Design Informatics runs a series of activities that we strongly encourage our PhD students to proactively engage in: \nDesign Informatics and BRAID research seminars\nThe Design Informatics Research Seminar series was established in 2012 and has featured a series of high-profile international speakers. At the moment, we co-run these seminars with the AHRC BRAID responsible AI programme, which is co-led by our institute. The weekly talks programme is open to Staff (research, teaching and technical), Resident Entrepreneurs and Students, University of Edinburgh researchers and visitors. Talks are delivered by invited speakers from all around the world as well as University of Edinburgh staff who are involved with social, technical and environmental research that relates to Design Informatics in its broadest sense.  \nDesign Informatics Research Bytes and Creative Circles sessions\nEach week we run a Research Byte or a Creative Circles session. These are more informal than our research seminars, and are typically kept to just members of the Institute for Design Informatics to participate in. The Research Bytes typically involve short talks or activities led by design informatics members, sharing their projects or to open up a topic for discussion. The Creative Circles are more focused on sharing of practice-led projects and to have a shared space for sharing of work that involves creative and design practice. We hold these different weekly events to make opportunities for members across the institute to connect, share and talk in a social space about their work.   \nDesign Informatics PhD community events\nWe have an active PhD community within the institute, who self-organise a regular series of get-togethers and gatherings to ensure students come together to discuss their studies. These events are student led, and the nature of what they focus on changes over time. Examples include sessions where PhD students have invited academics or industry collaborators to come and talk about post-PhD careers, or skills-sharing workshops, or show and tells about research, or practice talks for upcoming conference presentations.\n\n\nHow to Apply \n\nIf you are interested in pursuing a PhD within the Institute for Design Informatics you are welcome to contact staff within the Institute through the supervisors’ page.  \nThe Institute spans the Edinburgh College of Art and the School of Informatics, and entry to the PhD programmes is made directly through each School, depending on which school your primary supervisor is based within. \nFor Edinburgh College of Art based supervisors, PhD applicants would typically apply for the Design PhD / MPhil programme: https://postgraduate.degrees.ed.ac.uk/?r=site/view&edition=2025&id=753  \nFor School of Informatics based supervisors, PhD applicants would typically apply for the ILCC PhD / MScR programme: https://postgraduate.degrees.ed.ac.uk/?r=site/view&edition=2024&id=491  \nEach School will also have its own studentship competitions advertised each year (typically with deadlines in early Winter each year). \nIf you would like any help in identifying an appropriate supervisor within the Institute for Design Informatics, please contact Frauke Zeller (Institute Co-Director, ECA) and John Vines (Institute Co-Director, Informatics) who will try to direct you to appropriate academics.\nLINKS\n→ECA - School of Design→School of Informatics\n[GRID_TABLE]\nProgramme\nStudent Voices\nFacilities / FAQ\nApply / Contact\n[GRID_TABLE]\nResearch Themes\nSupervisors\nProject examples\nFacilities / Culture\nApply / Contact",
