The satellite had entered the designated orbit for operation at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in Gansu Province at 12.59 pm yesterday, marking the start of a joint venture between HKUST and Chang Guang Satellite Technology Co. Ltd (Chang Guang) for scientific research.\nFollowing the collection of the first batch of earth environmental monitoring remote sensing data from space by “HKUST-FYBB#1”, both sides will join hands to build a multimodal remote sensing satellite constellation and develop a comprehensive system for environmental monitoring and disaster forecasting system.\nThe officiating guests of the celebration ceremony were Dr. WANG Songmiao, Secretary General of the Liaison Office of the Central People’s Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (CLO); Mr. FANG Jianming, Deputy Commissioner of the Commissioner’s Office of China’s Foreign Ministry in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR); Ms. WU Cheng, Deputy Director-General of the Department of Education and Technology of CLO; Mr. Jeff SZE, Under Secretary for Education of the HKSAR Government; Mr. Clarence LEUNG, Under Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs; Dr. Marcus LIU, Political Assistant to the Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry; Dr. John CHAN, HKUST Pro-Chancellor; The Hon. Andrew LIAO Cheung-Sing, HKUST Court Chairman; Prof. Harry SHUM, HKUST Council Chairman; Prof. Nancy IP, HKUST President; several Legislative Council Members; members of the HKUST Court, Council Members and the senior management.\nMore than 400 faculty members and students of the University, as well as visitors from the wider community including about 30 pupils and parents from PLK Yip Ng Bun Bun Kindergarten and PLK Yip Ng Bun Bun Queen’s Hill Kindergarten, joined the ceremony at the Shaw Auditorium to celebrate the historic satellite launch. The showing of a video clip of the successful launch of the “HKUST-FYBB#1” was greeted by a round of warm applause from the participants. Meanwhile, over 7500 people have also joined the event virtually.\nAt the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center, Mr. Francis YIP Chi-Hung and his wife, Mrs. Catherine YIP NG Bun-Bun, who sponsored the satellite launch; HKUST Vice-President for Institutional Advancement Prof. WANG Yang, the driving force behind the plan, and Prof. ZHANG Limin, Head and Chair Professor of HKUST’s Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering who co-lead the research project, witnessed the historic moment.\nProf. Wang and Prof. Zhang were connected via telephone with three HKUST speakers at the ceremony, namely Prof. SU Hui, a Global STEM Professor co-leading the remote sensing technology research team; Prof. YU Hongyu, Associate Professor at HKUST’s Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, and a student involved in the project. They discussed HKUST’s development of remote sensing satellite technology and the satellite constellation program’s potential contributions to regional environmental and disaster monitoring. The panel discussion drew enthusiastic responses from students, who proactively raised questions.\nCommending the satellite launch, Under Secretary for Education Mr. Jeff Sze said, “As a top research-focused institution, HKUST has been breaking boundaries in multiple key areas. Today, I am honored to witness the successful launch of the Hong Kong higher education sector’s first earth environmental remote sensing satellite by HKUST in collaboration with Chang Guang at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center. By using high-end monitoring technology to provide scientific data, the satellite will ultimately create a comprehensive environmental monitoring and disaster prediction system, making concrete contributions to Hong Kong and our country’s sustainable development goals. I know that multiple parameters of the satellite are on par with high international standards, which reflects the University's outstanding strength in scientific research and signifies the deep collaboration between the Mainland and Hong Kong in the area of aerospace technology.”\nHKUST Council Chairman Prof. Harry Shum expressed gratitude to Mr. Francis Yip Chi-Hung and his wife, Mrs. Catherine Yip Ng Bun-Bun, for their generous donation, which has made the University’s satellite program possible. He said, “In the face of pressing global climate challenges, we launched this comprehensive remote sensing satellite program hoping to provide data support for macro decision-making in disaster response, environmental monitoring and sustainable resource management. The aerospace industry plays a vital role in the country’s overall development strategy. This satellite launch is yet another successful example of collaboration between the Mainland and Hong Kong in the field of aerospace. In recent years, the HKSAR Government has taken significant measures to attract and retain scientific research talents. The leading scientist behind this satellite launch, for example, is a Global STEM Professor supported by the HKSAR Government. We will continue to strengthen collaborations with all sectors to create more development opportunities for Hong Kong’s researchers. This launch will mark a dazzling milestone in Hong Kong’s integration into the national development framework.”\nHKUST President Prof. Nancy Ip said, “The aerospace industry is both an integral part of national development strategies and one of the key areas of the University’s research efforts. The ‘HKUST-FYBB#1’ satellite marks our initial venture into the realm of satellite projects, which not only represents a significant step in aerospace science but also opens new direction for collaboration and exchange between the Mainland and Hong Kong. HKUST will harness its strength in scientific research and collaborate with government departments, research institutions, and industry partners to promote innovation and application of satellite remote sensing data in sustainable development, contributing to national advancement in aerospace industry through industry-academia-and-research collaboration.”\nHKUST will establish an interdisciplinary research team.
