The course teaches the mindsets, skill sets, and toolsets of design thinking with a focus on its use in development. The course is focused around the following modules that cover core phases of the design process: observe and notice, frame and reframe, imagine and design, and make and experiment. Students will also learn the theory of change and methods for assessing potential impact of technology interventions. Students will be expected to learn ethnographic interviewing, webs of abstraction, ideation, and basics of both hardware and software prototyping. The course will engage social impact designers from industry as speakers and coaches.\nDevEng 203: Digital Transformation of Development: As technology use proliferates globally, there exists significant potential leverage to further understand and improve the lives and livelihoods of people in low-resource settings. Through a careful reading of recent research and through hands-on analysis of large-scale datasets, this course introduces students to the opportunities and challenges for data-intensive approaches to development. Students should be prepared to dissect, discuss, and replicate academic publications from several fields, including development economics, machine learning, information science, and computational social science. Students also will conduct original statistical and computational analysis of real-world data. They will gain an introduction to sensors as well as tools and methods for spatial modeling and spatial data analysis.\nTwo electives are required in addition to the above courses.\nDevEng 202: Critical Systems of Development: This course is intended to provide students in the Master of Development Engineering with the necessary background and knowledge to undertake projects and work experience of a global scope. Students will be exposed to a diversity of methodological frameworks, introduced to the skills needed to effectively participate in the sustainable development field (such as systems mapping and landscape analysis), and to understand the history and ethics of global development. Students will be required to complete an annotated bibliography and a systems analysis of a problem of interest.\nDevEng 204: Introduction to Social Entrepreneurship: Social entrepreneurship entails market-oriented approaches to address social problems for sustainable, scalable outcomes. This course will enable students to frame complex problems and devise entrepreneurial approaches for addressing them. Students study the dynamics of societal challenges and the conceptual framework of social innovation and social entrepreneurship from theoretical and practical perspectives. Students also explore technology solutions to address global social problems with a systems thinking approach. Students additionally learn how to develop appropriate business models and implementation strategies for a social venture. Student projects will integrate the development engineering goals of creating technology interventions designed to improve human and economic development in complex low-resource settings. This course is the first of a sequence of two final project courses for candidates of the Master of Development Engineering.\nDevEng 205: Development Engineering Applications: This course is the second of a sequence of two final project courses for candidates of the Master of Development Engineering. Students engage in professionally oriented independent or group projects under the supervision of an advisor. The projects integrate the development engineering goals of creating technology interventions designed to improve human and economic development within complex low-resource settings.\nDevEng 206: Ethical Reflection and Portfolio Building (2 units): This course is intended to provide students with a forum for reflection on the Summer Internship component of the Master of Development Engineering as well as projects worked on to date. Topics covered by the course will include issues of power and privilege, civic engagement, political/public policy contexts, tensions between tourism vs. travel, and community service vs. engagement. Students will discuss and produce an op-ed on an issue of interest. Students will also develop a portfolio to capture their individual point of view and skill sets developed in the MDevEng.\nDevEng 290: Perspectives on Development Engineering (1 unit): Development Engineering represents a new interdisciplinary field that integrates engineering, economics, business, natural resource development, and social sciences to develop, implement, and evaluate new technological interventions that address the needs of people living in poverty in developing regions and low-income areas of the United States. This seminar, offered once per year, will feature guest lecturers with insightful perspectives on the emergent field. The DevEng 290 series covers current topics of research interest in development engineering. The course content may vary from semester to semester. All topics will address the development engineering goals of developing technology interventions designed to improve human and economic development within complex, low resource settings.\nThe University of California, Berkeley Blum Hall, #5570 Berkeley, CA 94720-5570 (510) 643-5316 • blumcenter@berkeley.edu\nAccessibility | Nondiscrimination | Privacy\n• About\nApply\nFunding\nTravel Grant\nFaculty\nFellows\nContact Us\n• About\n• Apply\n• Funding\n• Travel Grant\n• Faculty\n• Fellows\n• Contact Us\n• About\n• Apply\n• Funding\n• Travel Grant\n• Faculty\n• Fellows\n• Contact Us\n[GRID_TABLE]\nRequired Courses \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Fall Semester\n\nDevEng C200: Design Evaluate & Scale Development Technologies: The course provides project-based learning experience in the development of human-centered products, services, or systems.

Topics covered by the course will include issues of power and privilege, civic engagement, political/public policy contexts, tensions between tourism vs. travel, and community service vs. engagement. Students will discuss and produce an op-ed on an issue of interest. Students will also develop a portfolio to capture their individual point of view and skill sets developed in the MDevEng.DevEng 290: Perspectives on Development Engineering (1 unit): Development Engineering represents a new interdisciplinary field that integrates engineering, economics, business, natural resource development, and social sciences to develop, implement, and evaluate new technological interventions that address the needs of people living in poverty in developing regions and low-income areas of the United States. This seminar, offered once per year, will feature guest lecturers with insightful perspectives on the emergent field. The DevEng 290 series covers current topics of research interest in development engineering. The course content may vary from semester to semester. All topics will address the development engineering goals of developing technology interventions designed to improve human and economic development within complex, low resource settings.Two electives are required in addition to the above courses.\nFirst Fall Semester\n\nDevEng C200: Design Evaluate & Scale Development Technologies: The course provides project-based learning experience in the development of human-centered products, services, or systems. The course teaches the mindsets, skill sets, and toolsets of design thinking with a focus on its use in development. The course is focused around the following modules that cover core phases of the design process: observe and notice, frame and reframe, imagine and design, and make and experiment. Students will also learn the theory of change and methods for assessing potential impact of technology interventions. Students will be expected to learn ethnographic interviewing, webs of abstraction, ideation, and basics of both hardware and software prototyping. The course will engage social impact designers from industry as speakers and coaches.DevEng 203: Digital Transformation of Development: As technology use proliferates globally, there exists significant potential leverage to further understand and improve the lives and livelihoods of people in low-resource settings. Through a careful reading of recent research and through hands-on analysis of large-scale datasets, this course introduces students to the opportunities and challenges for data-intensive approaches to development. Students should be prepared to dissect, discuss, and replicate academic publications from several fields, including development economics, machine learning, information science, and computational social science. Students also will conduct original statistical and computational analysis of real-world data. They will gain an introduction to sensors as well as tools and methods for spatial modeling and spatial data analysis.Two electives are required in addition to the above courses.\nSpring Semester\n\nDevEng 202: Critical Systems of Development: This course is intended to provide students in the Master of Development Engineering with the necessary background and knowledge to undertake projects and work experience of a global scope.

We do not admit students for spring semesters.\nWe currently do not offer concurrent degree programs with the MDevEng. UC Berkeley does not offer ad hoc joint degree programs and applicants may only apply to one single degree program per admissions cycle.\nWe expect to welcome 35 students for the Fall 2023 cohort.\nWe expect to admit a cohort of students representing a wide range of backgrounds and skill sets. Students will have strengths in different areas, and we expect that many of our entering students will want to spend some time before the program begins further developing some core skills, to prepare themselves for success and take advantage of their time at UC Berkeley.\nThe target audience for the program is early- to mid-career professionals with an interest in advancing technology-driven solutions for local and global development. All applicants, regardless of concentration area, must have the requisite technical preparation. At minimum, all applicants should have two-course series in a technical area, such as computer science, economics, mathematics, physics, engineering, or data science, dependent on their undergraduate major.\nWhile post-baccalaureate work experience is not required for this program, prospective students are encouraged to have one to three years of work experience before applying.

The MDP is an interdisciplinary degree governed by faculty of the MDP Graduate Group drawn from throughout UC Berkeley. It is housed within the Graduate School of Public Policy (GSPP). The MDevEng and MDP share similar goals in that they both prepare leaders to contribute to efforts by governments, NGOs, bi- and multilateral organizations, businesses, and social enterprises to build a more just and sustainable future. Both have an internship/practicum requirement. MDevEng is three semesters long while the MDP is four. MDevEng has strong design, engineering, and technology components, with an emphasis on solving complex problems through entrepreneurship and human-centered design. It provides students with opportunities to diversify through courses offered by a variety of partner departments and a related capstone project.  The MDP has depth in economics, quantitative and qualitative methods, and natural/physical sciences. It develops a broad foundational skillset and provides opportunities to specialize through project work, courses drawn from throughout the university and a Final (capstone) Project or Master’s Thesis.\nWhat are the key differences between the M.Eng and MDevEng programs？\n\n\nThe Berkeley MEng is a two-semester cohort program with 450-600 students that not only develops leadership and professional skills but also advances the engineering skills of future engineering leaders. Students can select from a menu of over 35+ concentrations in new and emerging technical fields led by one of seven College of Engineering departments.\n\n\n\n\nThe MDevEng program is a three-semester, interdisciplinary program with 35-40 students from early- to mid-career professionals interested in advancing technology-driven solutions for local and global development. The focus is on design and innovation using technology for social impact. A summer internship opportunity is built into the program design.\n\n\n\nBoth are professional degree programs for students targeting a career in industry, entrepreneurship, nonprofit or other non-academic positions. Compare the Berkeley MEng to other UC Berkeley College of Engineering professional degree programs.\n[GRID_TABLE]\nBlum Center for Developing EconomiesThe University of California, Berkeley Blum Hall, #5570 Berkeley, CA 94720-5570 (510) 643-5316 • blumcenter@berkeley.eduAccessibility | Nondiscrimination | Privacy \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Learn More \n\n\n\nContact Us \n\n\n\nAdmissions \n\n\n\nFinancial Aid \n\n\n\nFAQs \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplore \n\n\n\nNews & Events \n\n\n\nRequired Courses \n\n\n\nWho should apply?

Dr. Perez holds a PhD in architecture with a research focus on the impact of digital technologies specifically in developing regions, and previously served as Program Coordinator for the NSF INFEWS: STEM Training for Actionable Research and Global Impact NRT.\nProfessor Shankar Sastry is the Principal Investigator of DToD and the Thomas M. Siebel Professor in Computer Science. He previously served as Faculty Director of the Blum Center for Emerging Economies for 15 years, and as the Development Impact Lab’s Co-Director and PI of Sustainable Development Solutions. Professor Sastry is the Faculty Director of the FHL Center for Enhanced Reality, a Professor of EECS, Bioengineering, and Mechanical Engineering, and the Co-Director of the C3.ai Digital Transformation Institute.\nProfessor Anil Aswani is an associate professor in industrial engineering and operations research (IEOR) at the University of California, at Berkeley. He received a BS in electrical engineering in 2005 from the University of Michigan, in Ann Arbor, and a PhD in electrical engineering and computer sciences with a designated emphasis in computational and genomic biology in 2010 from the University of California, at Berkeley. He has received an NSF CAREER award through the Operations Engineering program for his work on personalized healthcare, a Hellman Fellowship for his research on food insecurity, and the Leon O.

From these insights, students are able to devise and deploy digital tools to accelerate growth for low-income populations in the U.S. and globally.The DToD Program was created with the recognition that while digital transformation — the combination of the increase massive amount of digital information available on every aspect of human existence with analysis techniques such as Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) — has become a staple of multiple sectors of industry and commerce, it has been far less studied and applied to the far-reaching consequences of poverty alleviation, humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, and, more generally, improving outcomes for under-resourced or low-income populations. The training provided by DToD aims to address that gap ensuring that the analytic techniques and algorithms, privacy, fairness, mechanism design, and implementation of digital technology are relevant to under-served populations.The core training provided by DToD is centered around three key courses. Trainees will additionally participate in workshops and have access to DToD faculty and staff advising. Travel funding support for DToD-themed research internships and fieldwork is also available. A select number of trainees will also receive support in the form of 1-year fellowships, covering their UCB tuition and fees and $34,000 towards their graduate student stipend. The DToD program is led by:Matt Podolsky is the DToD Program Coordinator and a staff researcher at UC Berkeley.

Open to doctoral students from any department across campus, the program is ideal for those whose dissertation research explores how technology can be applied to address pressing global challenges with and within underserved communities.\nThrough a combination of coursework, research mentoring, and professional development, students gain the tools and frameworks needed to work effectively at the intersection of technology, policy, and development practice.\nSupported by USAID’s Global Development Lab, the DE in DevEng builds on Berkeley’s strengths in areas such as technological innovation, human-centered design, development economics, remote sensing, data science, and impact evaluation. Currently, the program also includes a fellowship opportunity in the Digital Transformation of Development (DToD).\nThrough the Graduate Group in Development Engineering, participants join a thriving community of scholars and practitioners—and gain access to a global network of partners and alumni dedicated to turning research into transformative, on-the-ground solutions.\nWhat is a Designated Emphasis? A Designated Emphasis (DE) is an official UC Berkeley credential that allows doctoral students to gain advanced training and recognition in a specialized area outside their home department. The DE is noted on the doctoral diploma and transcript.\nThe University of California, Berkeley Blum Hall, #5570 Berkeley, CA 94720-5570 (510) 643-5316 • blumcenter@berkeley.edu\nAccessibility | Nondiscrimination | Privacy\n• About\nApply\nFunding\nTravel Grant\nFaculty\nFellows\nContact Us\n• About\n• Apply\n• Funding\n• Travel Grant\n• Faculty\n• Fellows\n• Contact Us\n• About\n• Apply\n• Funding\n• Travel Grant\n• Faculty\n• Fellows\n• Contact Us\n[GRID_TABLE]\nBlum Center for Developing EconomiesThe University of California, Berkeley Blum Hall, #5570 Berkeley, CA 94720-5570 (510) 643-5316 • blumcenter@berkeley.eduAccessibility | Nondiscrimination | Privacy \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Learn More \n\n\n\nContact Us \n\n\n\nAdmissions \n\n\n\nFinancial Aid \n\n\n\nFAQs \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplore \n\n\n\nNews & Events \n\n\n\nRequired Courses \n\n\n\nWho should apply?

Open to doctoral students from any department across campus, the program is ideal for those whose dissertation research explores how technology can be applied to address pressing global challenges with and within underserved communities.Through a combination of coursework, research mentoring, and professional development, students gain the tools and frameworks needed to work effectively at the intersection of technology, policy, and development practice.Supported by USAID’s Global Development Lab, the DE in DevEng builds on Berkeley’s strengths in areas such as technological innovation, human-centered design, development economics, remote sensing, data science, and impact evaluation. Currently, the program also includes a fellowship opportunity in the Digital Transformation of Development (DToD).Through the Graduate Group in Development Engineering, participants join a thriving community of scholars and practitioners—and gain access to a global network of partners and alumni dedicated to turning research into transformative, on-the-ground solutions.What is a Designated Emphasis? A Designated Emphasis (DE) is an official UC Berkeley credential that allows doctoral students to gain advanced training and recognition in a specialized area outside their home department. The DE is noted on the doctoral diploma and transcript.\n[CARD]\nLearn More\nBlum Center for Developing EconomiesThe University of California, Berkeley Blum Hall, #5570 Berkeley, CA 94720-5570 (510) 643-5316 • blumcenter@berkeley.eduAccessibility | Nondiscrimination | Privacy \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Learn More \n\n\n\nContact Us \n\n\n\nAdmissions \n\n\n\nFinancial Aid \n\n\n\nFAQs \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplore \n\n\n\nNews & Events \n\n\n\nRequired Courses \n\n\n\nWho should apply? \n\n\n\nAlumni \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook-f\n \n\n\n\nTwitter\n \n\n\n\nYoutube\n \n\n\n\nLinkedin\n \n\n\n\nInstagram\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@ 2024 UC Berkeley Graduate Group in Development Engineering\n[CARD]\nLearn More\nBlum Center for Developing EconomiesThe University of California, Berkeley Blum Hall, #5570 Berkeley, CA 94720-5570 (510) 643-5316 • blumcenter@berkeley.eduAccessibility | Nondiscrimination | Privacy\n[CARD]\nAbout\nApply\nFunding\nTravel Grant\nFaculty\nFellows\nContact Us",
