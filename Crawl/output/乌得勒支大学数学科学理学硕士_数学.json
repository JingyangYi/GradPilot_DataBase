Or as a challenging game for creative problem solving (like how to use the distortion of mobile phone signals to estimate the size of raindrops)? Do you want to become a skilled professional, trained to create the models and business processes necessary for this computerized world?  Then this Master's might fit into the equation!\nThe research oriented Master’s programme Mathematical Sciences will provide you with a rich toolkit of creative problem solving skills that will turn you into a desired scientist, both in and outside academia. You will dive deep into mathematics, develop genuine research skills in pure, applied and industrial areas and learn to think out of the box.\nThis Master's is part of the national Mastermath programme, a collaboration of Dutch mathematics departments who joined efforts to enhance their Master's programmes. Due to this collaboration you can benefit from an exceptional list of mathematical courses, offered either by Utrecht University or another Dutch University.\nWe have our own Mathematics library, which also serves as a study space and meeting point for both students and staff. This creates a very intimate atmosphere that I think you don’t find very often.\nWithin the Master's you have a lot of freedom to tailor the programme to your own interests. You can choose one of the following tracks to focus on:\nIf you are up for it, you can also opt for a double Master's degree by combining this Master's with another Master's from the Graduate School of Natural Sciences (e.g. Theoretical Physics, Climate Physics or Computing Science).\nMathematical Sciences is a selective research Master’s programme.

EC stands for European Credits, where 1 EC equals 28 hours of work.\nThe programme is build around 6 tracks focusing either on Fundamental Mathematics or Mathematical Modelling. Upon enrolment you must select 1 track to determine the focus of your programme.\nThe curriculum of the programme is made up of a 75 EC course part divided over year 1 and the beginning of year 2, and a 45 EC research part in the rest of year 2.\nThe course part consists of:\nThe course list of this programme consists of compulsory courses (dependent on your track choice) and elective courses. View the course list to get a good impression of the options (rather than an exhaustive or definite overview).\nThe elective courses allow you to specialize in your area of interest and can be chosen either at Utrecht University (UU) or through Mastermath.\nIn order to expand the thematic range of your Master's programme, you can also choose to do a profile in your (elective) course part. A profile is a coherent set of courses of 30 EC on a single theme that is usually not a standard part of the programme. Within this Master's you can choose from the following profiles:\nIf you are passionate about sharing your knowledge, and you would consider a career as a teacher in secondary education, this profile might be right for you. The Educational Profile (30 EC) is offered by the Graduate School of Teaching (GST) and can be taken as part of this Master’s programme. The Educational profile consists of a couple of courses within the GST and an internship at a school. This profile complements coursework and a research project in the History of Mathematics well.More information about this profile.\nIn your second year, you’ll devote the majority of your time to a research project.\nYour research project can be carried out in the Mathematical Institute or in a company in the Netherlands or abroad. You will plan and conduct your own research in one of the specializations under the supervision of a staff member, and possibly with the help of an external tutor. You’ll report on your research in your Master’s thesis.\nUtrecht University offers several programmes for students looking for an extra challenge.
