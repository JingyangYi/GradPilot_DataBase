They are confirmed in the Autumn for students starting in the following academic year and are subject to change each year.\nFor those studying for more than one year, our fees are expected to increase modestly in line with Consumer Price Inflation measured in March each year. More information can be found on our Student Finance webpages.\nThe fee stated for a full-time Masters will usually be the total fee for a one-year programme. Fees for part-time and modular programmes (where available) are pro-rata.\nWill I pay the ‘Home’ or ‘International’ fee?\nThe fees charged for study at the University of Exeter fall broadly into two categories:\nYour fee status classification depends on whether you meet certain criteria such as having ‘settled status’ in the UK and meeting a three year ordinary residence requirement. Full information can be found on the UK Council for International Student Affairs (UKCISA) website.\nFrom 1 August 2021 the eligibility rules for Home fee status have changed for EU Students. Please refer to the UK Government website to see how this change affects you. Where EU students are not eligible for Home fees, they will be required to pay International fees.\nDue to the Common Travel Area arrangement, Irish Nationals living in the UK or Ireland will be eligible for Home fee status; further information around eligibility is available at the above UKCISA link.\nPlease note that the University is unable to determine the fee status of an individual until after an application has been received and we are in receipt of full information concerning individual circumstances. This will then inform the decision as to whether a fee status assessment should be conducted.\nWhat happens if I think my fee status is incorrect?\nIf you have received an offer and you think your fee status is incorrect you have 28 days, from the date of your offer, to query your status. To query your fee status within the 28 day period please contact us at ad-feestatus@exeter.ac.uk stating your full name, Exeter student number, programme for which you have been made an offer and providing details of why you think the fee classification is incorrect.\nCan I request an appeal?\nIf you have queried your fee status within 28 days of receiving your offer and disagree with the outcome, you may request an appeal. Appeals can be submitted either by the applicant or by a nominated decision-maker, and must be made in writing to the Admissions Fees, Funding and Finance Officer at ad-feestatus@exeter.ac.uk.\nYou should only submit an appeal if one or both of the following apply:\nThe appeal will be reviewed by a panel comprising at least two members of staff:\nEach panel member will review the case independently before meeting to discuss their conclusions. The final decision will be communicated in writing to the applicant by the Admissions Fees, Funding and Finance Officer (or their representative).\nI expect my circumstances to change prior to the first day of the first academic year of the course. Will my fee status change?\nWe base our decisions on an applicant’s residence status at time of application and do not hold applications or make offers conditional on fee status. If you are classified as an international student but your situation changes before you have received a decision on your application or after receiving an offer we will conduct a fee reassessment. You will need to submit your new information before 1 September in the year the programme starts, e.g. evidence of British Citizenship or Indefinite Leave to Remain being granted.\nCan my fee status change after the course has started?\nThere are some circumstances where fee status can change in subsequent years, however this is very unusual.\nIf you think you have become entitled to ‘Home’ fees in time for the next year of your course please contact us at ad-feestatus@exeter.ac.uk giving full details of your updated status.\nThe full eligibility criteria can be found on the UK Council for International Student Affairs (UKCISA) website.\nInformation for Channel Islands/Isle of Man students\nFrom the 2021/22 academic year, new and continuing students living in the Crown Dependencies (the ‘Islands’), who come to England solely for the purposes of higher or further education study, will be eligible for home fee status, on the basis of 3 years’ residency in the UK or the Islands. The UK Government confirmed this eligibility in December 2020. For information on support available to you for tuition fees and living costs you should contact your island education offices.\nPlease visit our Student Finance webpage for Channel Islands students for more information.\nIn addition to tuition fees and living costs, your programme of study may have other costs associated with it, such as laboratory equipment or field trips.\nVisit our scholarships and funding website >>\nWhat if my programme lasts more than one year?\nIf the duration of your chosen programme of study spans more than one academic year, the tuition fees for future years are expected to rise by a modest amount to take account of inflationary pressures. You can view tuition fees for students already studying with us on our Student Finance web pages.\nWhen are my fees due?\nIf you receive an offer of a place on a full-time taught postgraduate programme you will need to pay a tuition fee deposit to confirm your place.\nTuition fees are typically payable in two 50% instalments, normally in September (at the start of your course) and January each year. See our student finance pages for more details.\nHow much will it cost?\nWhen you're studying for a Masters your tuition fee is only one part of the cost of doing a postgraduate degree: you also have to consider accommodation and living costs.\nAccommodation costs will vary depending on whether you live in private or University-owned accommodation. More details regarding accommodation, including costs, are available on our accommodation page.\nThe National Union of Students estimates student living costs, including accommodation, to be approximately £12,000 per year outside London.\nLiving costs are, to some extent, up to you.
