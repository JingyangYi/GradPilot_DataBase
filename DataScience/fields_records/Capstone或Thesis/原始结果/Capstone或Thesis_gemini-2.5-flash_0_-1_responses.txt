  response 3: The browsed pages provide general information about the Ph.D. program but do not explicitly list non-coursework graduation requirements like a thesis, comprehensive exam, or capstone project in a concise summary.

However, the second URL (https://infosci.cornell.edu/phd) has a section "Degree Requirements and Curriculum" under "PHD" and a link to "Ph.D. Student Handbook". These are promising links for finding the required information.

I will browse the "Ph.D. Student Handbook" link, which seems to be the most comprehensive source.
------------------------------------------------------------

项目 31: Cornell University - M.P.S. - Applied Statistics (Data Science) 
  response 1: The first URL states: "The M.P.S. is not equivalent to an M.S. on several counts: the M.P.S. has a project (a large-scale data-analysis project) rather than a thesis or a qualifying exam (which would be the case for an M.S.)."

The second URL also mentions: "Built on the three curriculum components of core courses, an in-depth data science project, and elective coursework, our program offers students the option to focus their graduate education in one of two areas: techniques of applied statistical analysis or data science, which includes high performance computing, databases and scripting." and "An in-depth statistical analysis MPS project supported by the core courses".

Both sources confirm the requirement of a project.

项目 34: University of Chicago - MS - Data Science 
  response 1: The program page states: "Students must complete the required 5 core classes, 4 electives, and a comprehensive final project in order to be eligible for degree completion."

This seems to be the non-coursework requirement. It's a "comprehensive final project".

  response 2: Comprehensive final project required.
  response 3: Comprehensive final project required.
------------------------------------------------------------

项目 35: University of Chicago - Ph.D - Data Science 
  response 1: The admissions page does not contain information about graduation requirements.
The program page for "PhD in Data Science" contains sections relevant to graduation requirements beyond coursework.
Specifically, it mentions:
*   "Synthesis project" - "A milestone in this transition is completion of a synthesis project before the end of the second year in the program."
*   "Thesis Advisor and Dissertation Committee" - Students select an advisor and establish a thesis committee.
*   "Proposal Presentation and Admission to Candidacy" - "By the end of the third year, students should have scheduled and completed a proposal presentation to their committee in order to be advanced to candidacy."
*   "Dissertation Defense" - "The PhD degree will be awarded to candidates following a successful defense and the electronic submission of the final version of the dissertation to the University's Dissertation Office."
* "Teaching Assistantship (TA) Responsibility" - "Our PhD students have a a minimum requirement of 2 teaching assignments for Primary funding over their course of their degrees."

The key non-coursework requirements are a synthesis project, a dissertation proposal presentation, and a dissertation defense. The teaching assistantship is also a requirement.

The prompt asks to summarize the requirement(s) in one concise sentence.

I need to combine "Synthesis project", "Proposal presentation", "Dissertation defense", and "Teaching Assistantship".

Let's refine the sentence to be concise and cover all points.
"A synthesis project, a dissertation proposal presentation, a dissertation defense, and teaching assistantship are required."
This covers all the identified non-coursework requirements.
  response 2: A synthesis project, dissertation proposal presentation, dissertation defense, and teaching assistantship are required.
  response 3: A synthesis project, proposal presentation, and dissertation defense are required.

项目 42:  
University of Notre Dame - PHD - PHD IN ANALYTICS
  response 1: The content from the browsed URLs provides details about the PhD in Analytics program.
Specifically, the "Program Structure" section on the Mendoza College of Business page seems relevant.

Let's look at the "Program Structure" section from the second URL:
"Year Two: In year 2, you will continue to broaden and deepen your understanding of the analytics space with ITAO seminars related to Human-centered Statistics, Mathematical Modeling for Consumer Analytics, Operations and Prescriptive Analytics, and Data and Technology Ethics. At the end of the second year, you will have an examination requirement (in the form of an exam or paper). This examination will test your knowledge of ITAO seminar courses taken over the first two years."

"Year Four: In addition to managing your research portfolio, you'll focus on finalizing your dissertation topic and defending your proposal."

"Year Five: The final year will involve interviewing for open positions, completing dissertation chapters, and having your final defense."

Based on this, there is an examination requirement at the end of the second year and a dissertation/final defense requirement.

The question asks for "graduation requirements that go beyond regular coursework".
The examination requirement and dissertation/final defense clearly fall into this category.

Let's formulate the answer concisely.
The information states "examination requirement (in the form of an exam or paper)" and "completing dissertation chapters, and having your final defense".

So, the non-coursework requirements are an examination/paper and a dissertation defense.
"Comprehensive exam and research dissertation required." seems appropriate.
It's stated that the exam is "in the form of an exam or paper", so "comprehensive exam or paper" could be more accurate, but "comprehensive exam" usually encompasses such assessments. Given the requested conciseness, "comprehensive exam" is probably fine, as it's testing knowledge.

Let's go with: "Comprehensive exam or paper and research dissertation required."

Checking the instructions:
- Summarize in one concise sentence.
- If multiple options, describe briefly (e.g., "Capstone or thesis option"). Here, it's exam or paper, and then dissertation.
- No quotes, no explanations.

The phrasing "examination requirement (in the form of an exam or paper)" suggests it's an either/or for that specific requirement.
The dissertation is clearly stated.

So, the two distinct non-coursework requirements are:
1. An examination/paper at the end of year two.
2. A dissertation defense in the final year.

Therefore, "Comprehensive exam or paper and research dissertation required." fits the criteria.
  response 2: Comprehensive examination, research thesis, and dissertation defense are required.
  response 3: Comprehensive examination and research dissertation with proposal and final defense required.

Specifically, the program URL states, "Students in the M.S. in Data Science (MSDS) program are taught by world-class faculty with industry experience, collaborate on team capstone projects sponsored by corporate and government partners...". This indicates that a capstone project is a required non-coursework component.

项目 61: University of Virginia - PHD - Data Science
  response 1: A qualifying exam and a dissertation, including a proposal and defense, are required.
  response 2: The browse results from the Admissions and Program URLs do not explicitly list non-coursework graduation requirements like a comprehensive exam, capstone project, or internship hours. However, the "Doctor of Philosophy in Data Science" page states, "Graduates of the Ph.D. in Data Science will have contributed novel methodological research to the field of data science, demonstrated their work has impactful interdisciplinary applications and defended their methods in an open forum." This strongly suggests a research thesis/dissertation requirement with a defense. It also mentions doctoral students "pursue advanced research" and "apprentice with faculty."

To confirm, I will perform a targeted search as per the instructions, specifically looking for "graduation requirement," "capstone," "thesis," "practicum," or "exam" on the UVA .edu domain.

项目 64: Carnegie Mellon University - MISM - Information Systems Management（BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE & DATA ANALYTICS）
  response 1: A required internship and a Data Analytics Capstone Project are graduation requirements.
  response 2: Internship required for 16-month tracks.
  response 3: Internship required for 16-month tracks.
------------------------------------------------------------

项目 65: Carnegie Mellon University - MISM - Information Systems Management（BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE & DATA ANALYTICS）
  response 1: The first URL is about admissions and prerequisites, not graduation requirements. The second URL provides "Key Program and Track Information" and states: "Internship: Required for 16-month tracks; no internship for 12-month tracks". This is a non-coursework graduation requirement.

Therefore, for the 16-month track, an internship is required. The prompt asks for *all* graduation requirements that go beyond regular coursework. It doesn't specify if I should mention specific tracks if the requirements differ. Given the specific pathway in the original request "BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE & DATA ANALYTICS", which has both 12-month and 16-month options, it's important to reflect this distinction.

The prompt asks for "one concise sentence—no quotes, no explanations. If multiple options exist, describe them briefly (e.g., “Capstone or thesis option”)."

So, the requirement for the MISM Business Intelligence & Data Analytics program regarding non-coursework items is an internship for the 16-month track, while the 12-month track has no internship requirement.

I will phrase the answer to reflect this.Internship required for 16-month tracks; no internship for 12-month tracks.
  response 2: The first URL is about admissions and application requirements, not graduation requirements.
The second URL, "Master of Information Systems Management | Business is the Engine ...", provides "Key Program and Track Information". It states: "Internship: Required for 16-month tracks; no internship for 12-month tracks".

This directly answers the question about non-coursework graduation requirements.
The program has two tracks, 16-month and 12-month. The internship is required for the 16-month track, but not for the 12-month track.

The request asks for "all graduation requirements that go beyond regular coursework".
The program URL specifies: "Internship: Required for 16-month tracks; no internship for 12-month tracks".

Since the question is about the MISM (BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE & DATA ANALYTICS) program, and it has both 16-month and 12-month options, the answer needs to reflect that.
The internship is a non-coursework requirement.
I don't see any mention of a capstone, thesis, comprehensive exam, practicum hours, fieldwork, research-lab hours, professional portfolio, or residency/clinical experience in the browsed pages.

Therefore, the only identified non-coursework requirement is the internship for specific tracks.
I need to summarize it in one concise sentence.
"Internship required for 16-month tracks." is a good candidate.
The prompt asks for requirements for the "graduate program below," which is "MISM Information Systems Management (BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE & DATA ANALYTICS)".
The provided URL states "Business Intelligence and Data Analytics" as one of the tracks.

So, the internship requirement applies to the MISM program, specifically the 16-month tracks (including BIDA 16-month track).
It is important to be precise about which tracks it applies to.
  response 3: An internship and a Data Analytics Capstone Project are required.

项目 67: Carnegie Mellon University - MCDS - Computational Data Science
  response 1: The first URL (apply-mcds-program) discusses application requirements, not graduation requirements.
The second URL (learn-us-requirements) is much more relevant. It states: "All three require the same total number of course credits split among required core courses, electives, data science seminar and capstone courses." and "Three (3) MCDS Capstone courses (11-635, 11-634 and 11-632) (36 units)". It also mentions a "summer internship" for both the "Professional Preparation" and "Research Preparation" options.

So, the non-coursework requirements are capstone courses and a summer internship.
Since the prompt asks for "requirements that go beyond regular coursework" and "Capstone project" is explicitly listed as an example, and "internship" is also an example. I should include both.

The prompt also says "Summarize the requirement(s) in one concise sentence—no quotes, no explanations. If multiple options exist, describe them briefly (e.g., “Capstone or thesis option”)."

The MCDS program requires three capstone courses and a summer internship.
I will phrase it as "Capstone courses and a summer internship are required."
Capstone courses are essentially a capstone project broken into multiple courses.
Since the prompt mentioned capstone project as an example of a non-coursework requirement, and the website states "Three (3) MCDS Capstone courses", this clearly falls under "Capstone project".
The "summer internship" is also a non-coursework requirement.

Therefore, the answer should be "Capstone courses and a summer internship are required."Capstone courses and a summer internship are required.

  response 2: The first URL () provides admission requirements and does not mention graduation requirements beyond coursework.
The second URL () "Learn With Us - Requirements" is highly relevant. It states: "All three require the same total number of course credits split among required core courses, electives, data science seminar and capstone courses." and "Three (3) MCDS Capstone courses (11-635, 11-634 and 11-632) (36 units)". It also mentions a "summer internship" for both "Professional Preparation" and "Research Preparation" degree options. However, it doesn't explicitly state that the internship is a *requirement* for graduation, only that it's part of the typical "timing" for the professional preparation track and included in the research preparation track. The capstone courses are explicitly listed as part of the 144 units required for graduation.

Given the prompt's focus on "non-coursework requirements that go beyond regular coursework", and the explicit mention of "Three (3) MCDS Capstone courses", this clearly indicates a capstone project requirement. The internship is mentioned as part of the "timing options" but not explicitly as a *mandatory* graduation requirement like the capstone courses are. Therefore, the most direct non-coursework requirement is the capstone.

Let's re-read the prompt carefully for the internship: "Professional Preparation — a 16-month degree consisting of study for fall and spring semesters, a summer internship, and fall semester of study." and "Research Preparation — a 20-month degree consisting of study for fall and spring semesters, a summer internship, and a second year of fall and spring study." While a summer internship is part of the "timing options", it's not explicitly listed as a *graduation requirement* in the "Core Curriculum" section, which lists "Three (3) MCDS Capstone courses". The capstone is listed under "Core Curriculum" which is "All MCDS students must complete 144 units of graduate study which satisfy the following curriculum".

Therefore, the only definitively stated non-coursework requirement is the capstone.
A capstone project is required.
Capstone project required
  response 3: The "Learn With Us - Requirements" page explicitly mentions "Three (3) MCDS Capstone courses (11-635, 11-634 and 11-632) (36 units)" as part of the core curriculum. It also mentions a "summer internship" for both "Professional Preparation" and "Research Preparation" degree options.

It states: "All MCDS students must complete 144 units of graduate study which satisfy the following curriculum: ... Three (3) MCDS Capstone courses (11-635, 11-634 and 11-632) (36 units)".
And regarding the timing options: "Professional Preparation — a 16-month degree consisting of study for fall and spring semesters, a summer internship, and fall semester of study." and "Research Preparation — a 20-month degree consisting of study for fall and spring semesters, a summer internship, and a second year of fall and spring study.".

So, a capstone and an internship are required.

  response 1: The PhD in Computational & Data Sciences requires two three-month research rotations, a qualifying exam, a defended thesis proposal, a defended dissertation, and a two-semester mentored teaching experience.
  response 2: The first URL (Admissions Checklist) focuses on application requirements and does not list graduation requirements beyond coursework. The second URL (Program Overview) also doesn't explicitly state non-coursework graduation requirements. It mentions "Doctoral students in Computational & Data Sciences receive strong methodological training in modern computational and statistical methods, and also acquire expertise in a particular social science application area." but this sounds like coursework.

I see a link to "Doctoral Student Handbook" on the program overview page, which might contain the information I need. I will browse that.

项目 93: University of Texas, Austin -  Ph.D. - Electrical and Computer Engineering 
  response 1: A dissertation is required, including a minimum of six hours of dissertation courses.
  response 2: The "Admissions" page and "Degrees" page provide an overview of the programs but do not explicitly state the non-coursework graduation requirements for the Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering. The "Degrees" page mentions "PhD students will participate in state-of-the-art research along with faculty researchers" and "Students within the PhD program are expected to enroll in at least 3 hours of research problems or, later, dissertation courses each semester". This hints at research and a dissertation, which is common for a PhD, but it doesn't explicitly state it as a *graduation requirement* beyond coursework.

I need to dig deeper for specific requirements. I will look for links on these pages that might lead to "Degree Requirements", "Program Handbook", or "Curriculum" for the PhD program. On the "Degrees" page, under "PhD", there is a "Learn More" button. I will click that.

项目 99: University of California, Santa Barbara - MA - Statistics-Data Science
  response 1: The browse results provide the following information:

From `https://www.pstat.ucsb.edu/graduate/ma`:

*   **Mathematical Statistics Specialization**: Students must pass a comprehensive examination corresponding to two of three course sequences, OR pass a comprehensive examination corresponding to one of the three sequences AND prepare a thesis under the supervision of a faculty member and defend it.
*   **Applied Statistics Specialization**: Students must pass a comprehensive written examination and submit a project report on data analysis.
*   **Data Science Specialization**: Students can choose or be assigned a project in PSTAT 230 to fulfill the Data Science Project requirement.

The question specifically asks about the "MA Statistics-Data Science" program. For the Data Science specialization, a project is required.

Therefore, the non-coursework requirement is a project. For the other specializations, there are comprehensive exams and/or a thesis. Since the question asks about "MA Statistics-Data Science", I should focus on that specialization.

The requirement for "MA Statistics-Data Science" is a project.

The output format requires "one concise sentence—no quotes, no explanations."

So, the answer should be "Project required".

Let me double check the specific wording "MA Statistics-Data Science". The program is "MA in Statistics" with specializations. Data Science is one of the specializations.

The exact wording from the Data Science specialization section is: "Students in this track can choose or be assigned a project in PSTAT 230 to fulfil the Data Science Project requirement".

This clearly indicates a project is a non-coursework requirement. For the other two specializations, it's either comprehensive exam or thesis. I will stick to the Data Science specialization as that is what was requested.

项目 113: University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign - MS - MS in Industrial Engineering with the Advanced Analytics Concentration
  response 1: Thesis or independent study required.
  response 2: The "MS in Industrial Engineering with the Advanced Analytics Concentration" page is the most relevant. It states:

"The MS in Industrial Engineering degree with the Advanced Analytics Concentration is offered on-campus and online. Students may choose to pursue the thesis or non-thesis option in the program. As a general guideline, students who do not wish to pursue a PhD program should enroll in the non-thesis option; students who plan to pursue a PhD must complete the thesis option."

It further details the requirements for each option:
*   **Thesis Option**: "24 hours of coursework and 8 hours of thesis research".
*   **Non-Thesis Option**: "32 hours of coursework and 4 hours of independent study".

Therefore, the non-coursework requirement is either a thesis or an independent study.

  response 1: An experiential learning component, which can be satisfied through statistical consulting, professional statistics, or an internship, is required.
  response 2: Experiential learning through statistical consulting, professional statistics, or an approved internship is required.
  response 3: The Admissions URL primarily discusses application requirements and financial aid, not graduation requirements.
The Program URL for MS: Statistics-Analytics details "Course Requirements". Under "Experiential Learning," it states: "Select one of the following - 4 hours: STAT 427 – Statistical Consulting (4 hours) STAT 443 – Professional Statistics (4 hours) STAT 593 – STAT Internship (0 or 4 hours)". It mentions "Team problem solving and communication of statistical results is critical for career success. The experiential learning requirement focuses on these skills and is a choice of consulting, professional preparation or approved internship."

This indicates that students must complete one of these options, which are non-coursework requirements (specifically, an internship or practical experience through consulting/professional statistics).

Therefore, a non-coursework requirement exists.
Internship or practical experience through statistical consulting or professional statistics is required.
Internship or practical experience required.

  response 2: The browse results show the "Program Requirements" section.
It states: "In addition to the core requirements, students are required to complete a minimum of 9 credits from a list of approved electives on the program website, at least 6 of which must be at the 400 level, and can optionally include up to six credits of thesis work."

This indicates that "thesis work" is an optional component for up to six credits, meaning it's not a mandatory non-coursework requirement. There is no mention of capstone, comprehensive exam, internship, practicum, fieldwork, research-lab hours, professional portfolio, residency, or clinical experience as mandatory requirements.

Therefore, the program has no additional non-coursework graduation requirements. No specific capstone, comprehensive exam, or mandatory thesis is listed. The thesis is an *optional* part of the elective credits, not a standalone graduation requirement.

Based on the information, there are no additional graduation requirements beyond coursework.
No additional graduation requirement.
  response 3: The browse results show the program requirements. The second URL explicitly states: "Approved Electives... can optionally include up to six credits of thesis work."

  response 3: The first URL is about how to apply to the Align programs and discusses general admission requirements like GPA, test scores, transcripts, resumes, letters of recommendation, and essays. It also mentions course waivers for some bridge courses. It does not mention any non-coursework graduation requirements.

The second URL is specifically for the Align MS in Data Science program in Silicon Valley. It outlines the program format, tuition, credits required for graduation (48 semester hours), and program description. It also has a section on "Experiential Learning" which mentions "Co-op" and "summer internship" opportunities for graduate students, typically after their second semester, lasting six to eight months for co-op or three to four months for an internship.

However, it states "Co-op makes the Northeastern graduate education richer and more meaningful" and "Graduate students typically have an experiential work opportunity". It doesn't explicitly state that a co-op or internship is a *mandatory graduation requirement*. It describes it as an "opportunity" and "enhanced learning" and "an avenue to intellectual and personal growth". It does not say it is a *requirement* for graduation.

I need to find a clear statement of graduation requirements that go beyond coursework. Since the current pages only mention co-op as an *opportunity* and not a *requirement*, I will use the search guideline to see if I can find a definitive statement from an .edu source.

It mentions "To explore course requirements and curriculum information for this program, please visit the Academics Page for the most up-to-date information."

I need to find the specific graduation requirements for the *Master of Science in Data Analytics Engineering* program. I will look for an "Academics Page" or similar under the Northeastern University domain. I will perform a search as suggested in the instructions if I cannot find it directly.

项目 204: Florida State University - MS - Statistical Data Science 
  response 1: The "Master of Science Degree | Department of Statistics" page is relevant. It states: "All MS degrees may be obtained through course work or a thesis option."

Specifically for the "Master of Science in Statistics with Major in Statistical Data Science", it lists STA5939 Introduction to Statistical Consulting (Capstone project) as a required course.

It also states, "The thesis option requires writing a thesis and an oral defense before the thesis committee."

So, there's a coursework-only option, a thesis option, and the Statistical Data Science major specifically requires a capstone project. The prompt asks for *all* requirements that go beyond regular coursework.

The Master of Science in Statistical Data Science requires a capstone project.
Additionally, for *all* MS degrees, a thesis option is available which involves writing and orally defending a thesis.

So, the non-coursework requirements are a capstone project for the Statistical Data Science major, or a thesis and oral defense as an option for all MS degrees.

The question is specifically about "Florida State University MS Statistical Data Science".

For the MS in Statistical Data Science, STA5939 Introduction to Statistical Consulting (Capstone project) is listed as a required course. This is a specific non-coursework requirement.

The document states "All MS degrees may be obtained through course work or a thesis option." This implies the MS in Statistical Data Science *could* also have a thesis option, but it also lists the capstone as a *required course* within its curriculum.

Let's re-read carefully: "The Department of Statistics at FSU offers two MS degrees in Statistics: an MS in Statistics (36 Required Credit Hours) and an MS in Statistics with major in Statistical Data Science (32 Required credit hours)."

"All MS degrees may be obtained through course work or a thesis option." This is a general statement.

Then under "Master of Science in Statistics with Major in Statistical Data Science", it lists "STA5939 Introduction to Statistical Consulting (Capstone project)" as a required course. This seems to be the specific non-coursework requirement for this particular major.

If "All MS degrees may be obtained through course work or a thesis option," and the Statistical Data Science degree *requires* a capstone project, does that mean the capstone is the "course work" option, or is the capstone *in addition* to the coursework/thesis option? The way it's phrased, the capstone is a *required course* within the curriculum.

Let's consider the output format: "Summarize the requirement(s) in one concise sentence—no quotes, no explanations. If multiple options exist, describe them briefly (e.g., “Capstone or thesis option”). If the program states there are no additional requirements, say so (e.g., “No additional graduation requirement”)."

The wording "STA5939 Introduction to Statistical Consulting (Capstone project)" strongly suggests the capstone project is the non-coursework component for this specific program. The general statement about "thesis option" applies to "All MS degrees".

Since the capstone is listed as a *required course* for the MS in Statistical Data Science, it *is* a non-coursework requirement (a project).

Is it possible to do a thesis *instead* of the capstone for the Statistical Data Science MS? The text says "All MS degrees may be obtained through course work or a thesis option." This implies flexibility. However, the data science program explicitly lists the capstone as a required course.

If it's "course work or a thesis option" generally, and the data science major lists a capstone as a required course, then it seems like the capstone *is* part of the coursework option for this specific degree.

Let's check the thesis option section again: "Master of Science in Statistics or Biostatistics, Thesis Option". It does not explicitly mention the "Statistical Data Science" major here, only "Statistics or Biostatistics". This might suggest the thesis option doesn't apply to the Statistical Data Science major.

Given the explicit listing of the "Capstone project" as a required course for the MS in Statistical Data Science, this is the most direct and certain non-coursework requirement. The general "thesis option" is described for "Statistics or Biostatistics", not explicitly for "Statistical Data Science".

Therefore, I will focus on the capstone project.
The capstone project is required for the MS in Statistical Data Science.

项目 233: University of Pittsburgh - MS - Industrial Engineering：Data Science
  response 1: A research thesis is an option for the Master of Science in Industrial Engineering program.
  response 2: The first URL is about graduate admissions in general, and the second URL is about the Master's Program. I need to look for "Requirements" or "Curriculum" links within the Master's Program page.

On the Master's Program page, I see "Program Offerings" which lists "Requirements". I will check that link.
The current page is `https://www.engineering.pitt.edu/departments/industrial/graduate/masters/masters-program/`.
I will look for a link within this page that specifically says "Requirements" under "Program Offerings". I will click on "Requirements" from the "Master's Program" page under "Program Offerings".

Since I cannot directly click on links from the previous browse, I need to assume the URL structure or find it on the page content.
Looking at the content of the "Master's Program" page, I see "Program Offerings Master of Science Joint Programs Certificates Requirements Graduate Co-Op". It does not provide direct links to these sub-sections.

I will try to construct a likely URL, or search again.
Given the structure `https://www.engineering.pitt.edu/departments/industrial/graduate/masters/masters-program/`, it is possible that requirements are on a sub-page, like `https://www.engineering.pitt.edu/departments/industrial/graduate/masters/masters-program/requirements/`.

Alternatively, I can use the search query as suggested. I will try the search query, as it's more reliable than guessing URLs.

  response 3: The first URL is about graduate admissions, and the second one is about the Master's Program. Neither of them directly state non-coursework graduation requirements. The second page, "Master's Program", has a section "Master's Program" which likely contains what I need. Under "Master's Program" there is "Requirements" and "Graduate Manual". The "Graduate Manual" seems promising. Let's look for a link to "Requirements" or "Graduate Manual" on the page.

Looking at the content of the "Master's Program" page, there's a link "IE Graduate Courses", "Graduate Manual". I will check the "Graduate Manual". I need to find the specific URL for the Graduate Manual. Since it's not directly provided in the content, I will try to find it by using the previous URL as base.

The "Master's Program" page also mentions "Program Offerings" and "Requirements". I need to find the link for "Requirements" specifically for the MS Industrial Engineering.

I don't see a direct link to the "Graduate Manual" or "Requirements" from the browsed content that I can click. I will use a concise search for "University of Pittsburgh MS Industrial Engineering Data Science graduation requirements" on the pitt.edu domain.

  response 2: The browsed page mentions "Students will still complete the existing requirements of each individual degree." This implies I need to check the requirements for the individual M.S. in Statistical Science and M.S. in Data Science programs.

I will go back to the "Degree Programs" section on the left navigation and look for those two specific programs.
The page has links for:
- Master of Science in Statistical Science
- Master of Science in Applied Statistics

- Ph.D. Minor in Statistical Science

It also states: "Students in this program satisfy the requirements of both the Data Science and Statistical Science M.S. programs".
I need to find the specific page for "Master of Science in Statistical Science" and the "Data Science M.S. program". The current page is for the dual degree. I will look for links on the page that could lead to the individual degree requirements.

I see "Master of Science in Statistical Science" under "Degree Programs" section on the left navigation. I'll browse that page.
I also need to find the Data Science M.S. program. I will try to find it on the same domain. I will look for a link to the Data Science M.S. program, it is not present directly on the current page.

  response 2: A capstone project is required for the Data Science portion, and either a one-semester consulting internship or a research paper is required for the Statistical Science portion.
  response 3: The browsed page describes the course requirements in detail but does not mention any non-coursework requirements such as a capstone, thesis, or exam. It states, "Students will still complete the existing requirements of each individual degree." This suggests I need to look into the requirements for the individual M.S. in Data Science and M.S. in Statistical Science programs.

Given the prompt's instruction to "use primary university sources only" and "You may open additional pages that live under the same university’s *.edu* domain", I will look for pages for the individual degrees. Since the current page is under `stat.indiana.edu`, I will look for links within this domain or use a targeted search.

I will search for "Indiana University, Bloomington M.S. Data Science graduation requirements site:.edu" and "Indiana University, Bloomington M.S. Statistical Science graduation requirements site:.edu" to find the individual degree requirements. Since the program is specifically called "Dual M.S. Degree program in Data Science and Applied Statistics", I will try to be more specific in my next search using the exact phrase provided by the prompt.

I will use the search query provided in the instructions, as it is more specific and might directly lead to the information.

项目 256: University at Buffalo, SUNY - MS - Industrial Engineering (Data Analytics Engineering)  
  response 1: Thesis or professional portfolio with a reflective paper is required.
  response 2: Thesis or professional portfolio with a reflective paper required.
  response 3: The Admissions URL provides general information about MS admissions but doesn't detail program-specific non-coursework requirements.
The Program URL for Data Analytics Engineering states: "Students enrolled in the Industrial and Systems Engineering MS program with a focus in Data Analytics Engineering must complete 30 credits of coursework, which may include up to 6 credits of IE 560 MS Research Guidance for the thesis track or up to 3 credits of IE 591 Project Guidance for CPT internships. Students who do not complete an MS thesis must submit a portfolio showcasing their completed assignments and a reflective paper outlining how they plan to apply their skills and knowledge after graduation."

This indicates two non-coursework options:
1.  A thesis track (IE 560 MS Research Guidance).
2.  For those not completing a thesis, a professional portfolio and a reflective paper are required.

So, it's a thesis or portfolio/reflective paper option.

Let's synthesize this into one concise sentence.
Research thesis or professional portfolio with a reflective paper is required.Research thesis or professional portfolio with a reflective paper is required.
------------------------------------------------------------

项目 257: University at Buffalo, SUNY - MS - Industrial Engineering (Data Analytics Engineering)  
  response 1: The program URL mentions: "Students who do not complete an MS thesis must submit a portfolio showcasing their completed assignments and a reflective paper outlining how they plan to apply their skills and knowledge after graduation." It also mentions "up to 6 credits of IE 560 MS Research Guidance for the thesis track or up to 3 credits of IE 591 Project Guidance for CPT internships."

So, there are two options: a thesis or a portfolio with a reflective paper.

The specific program is "MS Industrial Engineering (Data Analytics Engineering)".
The URL "https://engineering.buffalo.edu/industrial-systems/masters-programs/ms-industrial-engineering/ms-data-analytics.html" is for "Data Analytics Engineering - Degree Concentration for MS, Industrial Engineering". This seems to be the correct program.

The relevant sentence is: "Students who do not complete an MS thesis must submit a portfolio showcasing their completed assignments and a reflective paper outlining how they plan to apply their skills and knowledge after graduation."
This indicates that either an MS thesis or a portfolio with a reflective paper is required.
Capstone project or research thesis or comprehensive/qualifying exam or internship / practicum hours or mandatory fieldwork or research‐lab hours or professional portfolio or residency / clinical experience.

This fits "Research thesis" and "Professional portfolio".

The phrasing should be "Thesis or professional portfolio with a reflective paper required".
  response 2: The program URL states: "Students enrolled in the Industrial and Systems Engineering MS program with a focus in Data Analytics Engineering must complete 30 credits of coursework, which may include up to 6 credits of IE 560 MS Research Guidance for the thesis track or up to 3 credits of IE 591 Project Guidance for CPT internships. Students who do not complete an MS thesis must submit a portfolio showcasing their completed assignments and a reflective paper outlining how they plan to apply their skills and knowledge after graduation."

This indicates two options:
1. Thesis track: This involves "MS Research Guidance".
2. Non-thesis track: This requires a "portfolio showcasing their completed assignments and a reflective paper".

Let me re-read to make sure I capture all "non-coursework" requirements.
"MS Research Guidance for the thesis track" implies a research thesis.
"Students who do not complete an MS thesis must submit a portfolio showcasing their completed assignments and a reflective paper". This sounds like a professional portfolio.

So, it's either a research thesis or a professional portfolio with a reflective paper.

The prompt asks for "one concise sentence".

Research thesis or professional portfolio with reflective paper required.Research thesis or professional portfolio with reflective paper required.
  response 3: The program page for Data Analytics Engineering states: "Students who do not complete an MS thesis must submit a portfolio showcasing their completed assignments and a reflective paper outlining how they plan to apply their skills and knowledge after graduation."

This indicates two options: an MS thesis or a portfolio with a reflective paper.

Therefore, the non-coursework graduation requirement is either a thesis or a professional portfolio.

项目 258: University at Buffalo, SUNY - MPS - Data Sciences and Applications MPS
  response 1: No response text
  response 2: A data science project is required, with options for an industry internship, research project, or an elective.
  response 3: Data science project required, which can be fulfilled by an internship or a research project.
------------------------------------------------------------

项目 259: University at Buffalo, SUNY - MPS - Data Sciences and Applications MPS
  response 1: Data science project, internship, or research project required.
  response 2: The content mentions "Students will take a combination of core courses (24 credits), a data science applications course (3 credits) and a data science project (3 credits) for a total of 30 credits. Students have the opportunity to complete an internship in industry for their data science project requirements. Alternatively, students can opt to complete a research project with a faculty member, or complete an elective in place of a project."

It further states: "CDA 571/ Project Guidance This course will provide students with a final integrative project experience. The class will require students to obtain an integrative project experience either in industry or at the university. In either case the students will use the skills acquired during the other classes in executing project goals. Students will provide short reports to supervising faculty to ensure that learning objectives are being met."

This clearly indicates a project requirement. The options are an internship, a research project, or an elective in place of a project. However, the "Data Science Project" (CDA 571) is listed as a course requirement. The initial instruction asks for requirements "that go beyond regular coursework". Since the project is listed as a course (CDA 571), I need to clarify if it is considered a non-coursework requirement in the context of this question or if the "elective in place of a project" option truly means there isn't always a "project" beyond coursework.

The phrasing "Students have the opportunity to complete an internship in industry for their data science project requirements. Alternatively, students can opt to complete a research project with a faculty member, or complete an elective in place of a project." suggests that the project is a flexible requirement. Given that an internship or research project can fulfill it, it aligns with a "non-coursework" type of requirement even if it's tied to a specific course code. The "elective in place of a project" option makes it tricky.

Let me re-read the "What to output" section: "Summarize the requirement(s) in one concise sentence—no quotes, no explanations. If multiple options exist, describe them briefly (e.g., “Capstone or thesis option”). If the program states there are *no* additional requirements, say so (e.g., “No additional graduation requirement”)."

The core of the requirement is a "data science project" which can be fulfilled by an "internship", a "research project", or an "elective". If an elective can replace it, it might imply no *additional* non-coursework requirement if the student chooses that path.

However, the "data science project" (CDA 571) is described as a "final integrative project experience" and requires students to "obtain an integrative project experience either in industry or at the university". This sounds like a capstone or research project, even if it's a 3-credit course. The "elective in place of a project" seems like an alternative to the project itself.

Given the prompt's examples like "Capstone project required" or "Research thesis mandatory", and the description of CDA 571 as an "integrative project experience" fulfilled by an industry internship or research project, it seems to fall under the "capstone project" or "research project" category. The "elective in place of a project" is an *option* for fulfilling that *requirement*.

Therefore, a project experience is a requirement, with multiple ways to satisfy it. It's not *just* taking an elective.

I will phrase it as a project requirement with options.
"Data science project required, fulfillable through an internship, research project, or elective."
This is too long. I need to be more concise.

"Data science project required; internship or research project option available."
This still doesn't capture the "elective" part which could mean no *additional* non-coursework.

Let's consider the phrase "final integrative project experience" and that it can be an "internship in industry" or a "research project". This points to a project-based requirement. The "elective in place of a project" is an alternative *to* the project itself. If a student chooses the elective, then arguably there is no *additional* non-coursework requirement.

The prompt asks "all graduation requirements that go beyond regular coursework". If an elective can fully substitute the project, then for those students, there is no *beyond coursework* requirement.

This is a grey area. Let me re-evaluate the "CDA 571/ Project Guidance" course. It is a 3-credit course. Is a 3-credit course considered "beyond regular coursework"? The prompt states "Capstone project", "Research thesis", "Internship / practicum hours" as examples of non-coursework requirements. A capstone project can often be associated with a course, but it's the *nature* of the work (project, thesis, internship) that defines it as "beyond regular coursework" in this context.

The description of CDA 571 says "Students will obtain an integrative project experience either in industry or at the university." This strongly suggests a capstone-like experience.

The phrasing "or complete an elective in place of a project" is the sticking point. If this means a student can *choose* to not do a project/internship and instead take a regular course, then it implies there isn't always a "beyond regular coursework" requirement.

However, the main statement is "a data science project (3 credits)". The subsequent sentence offers alternatives to *that* project. The most common interpretation of "capstone project" or "research thesis" is that they are required, even if they sometimes carry course credit.

I should focus on what is *required* and what options fulfill that requirement. A "data science project" is required, and it can be fulfilled in different ways.

"Data science project required, with internship or research project options." This still doesn't capture the "elective" option which could negate a *non-coursework* requirement.

Let's consider the strictest interpretation of "beyond regular coursework." If an elective (a regular course) can replace it, then for that option, there is no "beyond regular coursework" requirement.

If the requirement *can be fulfilled* by *only* coursework (an elective), then it's not a universal *non-coursework* requirement.

I will lean towards "Not found" if the elective option truly means no additional non-coursework requirement *for all students*. But the prompt states "all graduation requirements that go beyond regular coursework". So if it exists as *an option* for fulfillment, it should be mentioned.

The "data science project" is a requirement, which can be an internship, research project, or another elective.
So, a project experience is a requirement, and two of its fulfillment methods (internship, research project) are indeed "beyond regular coursework" type activities, even if tied to a 3-credit course.

If I state "Capstone project required", it might be inaccurate because an elective can substitute.
If I state "No additional graduation requirement", it might be inaccurate because an internship or research project are options.

Let's re-read the "What to output" guidelines for multiple options: "If multiple options exist, describe them briefly (e.g., “Capstone or thesis option”)."

The program states: "Students will take...a data science project (3 credits)".
"Students have the opportunity to complete an internship in industry for their data science project requirements. Alternatively, students can opt to complete a research project with a faculty member, or complete an elective in place of a project."

This means there *is* a "data science project" requirement, and that project can be an internship or research project. The elective is an *alternative* to that project.

So, the requirement is a "Data Science Project". This project can be an internship, research project, or an elective.

The prompt wants requirements *that go beyond regular coursework*. An internship or research project fit this. An elective does not.

Since a student can choose an elective *instead* of a project or internship, it means that a non-coursework requirement is *not* universally mandated. If a student chooses the elective path, there would be no "beyond regular coursework" requirement for them.

This leads me to believe that there isn't a *mandatory* non-coursework requirement for all students.
The prompt asks to identify *all* graduation requirements that go *beyond* regular coursework. If it's optional to do something *beyond* regular coursework, then it's not a universal requirement *that goes beyond regular coursework*.

The prompt's examples like "Capstone project required" or "Research thesis mandatory" imply a universal requirement. If there's an option to simply take another course, it's not universally "beyond coursework".

Given the ambiguity created by the "elective in place of a project" option, I will stick to the strict interpretation: if it's not *mandated* for every student to complete something beyond coursework (because an elective can substitute), then it's not a universal "beyond regular coursework" requirement.

Therefore, "No additional graduation requirement" seems appropriate if the elective option means a student can avoid the "beyond coursework" activities.

Let's check the wording of the prompt again: "identify **all graduation requirements that go beyond regular coursework**".
If an internship or research project are options, then they *are* requirements that go beyond regular coursework, even if they are not the *only* way to fulfill the project requirement.

项目 280: Marquette University - MS - COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCE：AI and Analytics 
  response 1: Research thesis or oral examination required for the thesis option.
  response 2: <
  response 3: The first URL, `https://www.marquette.edu/grad/programs-computing.php`, mentions:
"33 Credit Hours* *Based on non-thesis (Plan B). See bulletin for thesis (Plan A) credit hours"
And also, "Information Assurance and Cyber Defense specialization: This option requires practical experience gained through a practicum."

The prompt specifically asks about the "MS COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCE: AI and Analytics" program.
The Information Assurance and Cyber Defense specialization mentions a practicum, but the AI and Analytics specialization does not explicitly state such a requirement on this page. However, it does state "See bulletin for thesis (Plan A) credit hours" and "Based on non-thesis (Plan B)". This indicates that a thesis option (Plan A) or a non-thesis option (Plan B) exists for the overall MS in Computer and Information Science program, which includes the AI and Analytics specialization.

I need to confirm if the thesis option (Plan A) applies to the AI and Analytics specialization and if there are any other specific non-coursework requirements for this specialization. The prompt asks to check the "Graduate School Bulletin". I will search for the "Graduate School Bulletin Marquette University Computer and Information Science" to find more details.

项目 307: University of Iowa - MS - data science
  response 1: Capstone project and practicum/internship required.
  response 2: Capstone project or practicum/internship required.
  response 3: The second URL (https://stat.uiowa.edu/graduate/ms-data-science) provides detailed information about the Master of Science in Data Science program.
Under the "Coursework" section, it states: "Students acquire hands-on experience in solving real-world problems, communication skills, and data ethics via a required capstone project."
Further down, in the "Requirements and program planning" and "Courses" sections, it lists "MS Data Science Practicum (DATA:5890 –1 course totaling 2 semester hours)".
It also mentions: "*Students may substitute DATA:5890 by an appropriate internship/summer work experience, with approval by the course instructor."

So, there is a required capstone project and a practicum that can be substituted with an internship.

The question asks for graduation requirements that go beyond regular coursework. A capstone project and practicum/internship fit this description.

Therefore, the non-coursework graduation requirements are a capstone project and a practicum or internship.

It also mentions "Final hands-on, collaborative capstone project" under "Fast Facts". The program also offers a Graduate Co-op option, but it's not stated as a mandatory graduation requirement; it's an option for full-time, on-campus students.

The second URL mentions "explore published doctoral dissertations at Drexel Libraries for more insights into the PhD in Information Science", which strongly suggests a dissertation is required, but it is not a direct statement of a graduation requirement. I need to find a more authoritative source on graduation requirements.

I will perform the suggested search to find more specific information on graduation requirements.

项目 320: Rochester Institute of Technology - MS - Data Science MS  
  response 1: A graduate capstone is required for students in the online program, while the on-campus program requires two applied data science seminar courses.
  response 2: No response text
  response 3: The browsed page mentions "Curriculum for 2024-2025 for Data Science MS". Under the "Data Science, MS degree, typical course sequence (online program)" and "Data Science, MS degree, typical course sequence (online + edX program)" sections, it lists "DSCI-799 Graduate Capstone" as a 3-credit hour course. The description for DSCI-799 states: "This non-class-based experience provides the student with an individual opportunity to explore a project-based or a research-based project that advances knowledge in an area of data science. The student selects a problem, conducts background research, develops the system or devises a research approach, analyses the results, and builds a professional document and presentation that disseminates the project. The report must include a literature review. The final report structure is to be determined by the capstone advisor.".

It also states under "Online Degree Information" that "The online program culminates with a capstone course and capstone project."

For the "on-campus program", it lists DSCI-601 and DSCI-602 "Applied Data Science I" and "Applied Data Science II" which seem to involve project development and presentation. While these sound like project-based courses, the explicit "Graduate Capstone" (DSCI-799) is specifically listed for the online programs and is described as a "non-class-based experience". The prompt asks for requirements that go beyond regular coursework. DSCI-799 seems to fit this description.

Let me re-read the description of DSCI-601 and DSCI-602 for the on-campus program to see if they are equivalent to a capstone or thesis.

项目 323: University of Colorado, Boulder - MS - Professional Master's in Data Science
  response 1: The browse results indicate that the program offers "Capstone projects that apply data science techniques to real business and scientific problems". This is listed under "experiential learning opportunities".

Let me check the "Graduation Information" link mentioned on the first page to confirm.
However, it is not a direct link to a new page, but rather a heading. I'll search for "Graduation Information" within the provided pages.

Upon reviewing the content, the second URL mentions "Capstone projects that apply data science techniques to real business and scientific problems" under the section "What kind of experiential learning opportunities are available through CU Boulder's MS in Data Science?". This strongly suggests a capstone project is a non-coursework requirement.

I'll formulate the answer.
  response 2: The browse results indicate "Capstone projects that apply data science techniques to real business and scientific problems" and "Internship support through elective course credit for students who secure internships within industry" as experiential learning opportunities. This suggests that a capstone project is an option and internships are supported, but it doesn't explicitly state if they are *required* for graduation.

I will search for "Graduation Information" link mentioned in the first browse result.
In the first browse result, under "Master of Science in Data Science" and "College of Engineering and Applied Science", there is a link "Graduation Information". I will try to find the URL for this link and browse it. Since it's not directly visible, I'll use the search tool as per the guidelines.
